      "text": "APOCALYPSE EXPLAINED 651 Editor’s Preface This edition of Apocalypse Explained was translated by John C. Ager and revised by John Whitehead. The text for this edition was electronically scanned from the Foundation’s Standard Edition. This process has allowed the book to be completely redesigned and set in a new and more readable typeface. Certain stylistic changes have also been introduced. These include modernized spelling and punctuation as well as substituting new words for terms whose meanings have become obscure or have changed since the nineteenth century. Arabic numerals have replaced roman numerals in Bible passages, and certain capitalized words including pronouns referring to God have been lowercased to reflect contemporary usage. All these changes have been carefully made in order to make the book easier to read and use while preserving the dignity and power of the original Latin. On the whole, however, the Ager/Whitehead translation has not been materially altered. Volume 2 of Apocalypse Explained continues Swedenborg’s verse- by-verse exposition, or commentary, of the biblical text of the Apocalypse, commonly known as Revelation or the Revelation of John. This volume covers chapters 5 and 6. As was the custom in his day, Swedenborg referred to the Psalms as the book of David, and to the Pentateuch (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy) as the books of Moses. As with previous printings, the bold numerals in brackets, [2], [3], etc., indicate divisions of Swedenborg’s longer numbered sections that were added for the convenience of the reader by J. F. Potts in his six-volume Swedenborg Concordance (London: Swedenborg Society, 1888–1902). The numbers in parentheses (6), (7), etc., are divisions of the exposition by the author. Italicized letters following a number (518a, 518b) are subdivisions added by the Latin editor, S. H. Worcester. The critical notes were originally compiled by Worcester when he edited the Latin text for a Latin-English edition of Apocalypse"

And no one was able, in heaven nor upon the earth nor under the earth, to open the book, neither to look thereon. 4. And I wept much, that no one was found worthy to open and to read the book, neither to look thereon. 5. And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not; behold, the lion that is from the tribe of Judah, the root of David, hath overcome to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof. 6. And I saw, and behold, in the midst of the throne, and of the four animals, and in the midst of the elders, a lamb standing as if slain, having seven horns, and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the earth. 7. And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne. 8. And when he had taken the book, the four animals and the four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb, having every one harps, and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints. 9. And they were singing a new song, saying, Worthy art thou to take the book, and to open the seals thereof; for thou wast slain, and didst redeem us to God in thy blood, out of every tribe and tongue, and people and nation; 10. And hast made us unto our God kings and priests; and we shall reign upon the earth. 11. And I saw, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the animals and the elders; and the number of them was myriads of myriads, and thousands of thousands; 12. Saying with a great voice, Worthy is the lamb that was slain to receive the power, and riches, and wisdom, and honor, and glory, and blessing. 13.

And the four animals said, amen; and the four and twenty elders fell down and worshiped him that liveth unto the ages of the ages. EXPOSITION 296. Verse 1. And I saw in the right hand of him that sat upon the throne a book written within and on the back, sealed up with seven seals. 1. “And I saw in the right hand of him that sat upon the throne” signifies the Lord in respect to omnipotence and omniscience (n. 297, 298); “a book written within and on the back” signifies the state of life of all in heaven and on the earth, in general and in particular (n. 299); “sealed up with seven seals” signifies altogether hidden (n. 300). 297. Verse 1. And I saw in the right hand of him that sat upon the throne, signifies the Lord in respect to omnipotence and omniscience. This is evident from the signification of “right hand,” as being, in reference to the Lord, omnipotence and also omniscience (of which presently); also from the signification of “him that sat upon the throne,” as being the Lord in respect to Divine good in heaven; for in general “throne” signifies heaven, in particular the spiritual heaven, and abstractly Divine truth proceeding, from which heaven is, and by which judgment is effected (see above, n. 253). By “him that sat upon the throne,” and also by “the lamb,” that took the book from him that sat upon the throne, the Lord is meant, because by “him that sat upon the throne” the Lord in respect to Divine good is meant, and by “the lamb” the Lord in respect to Divine truth. There are two things that proceed from the Lord as the sun of heaven, namely, Divine good and Divine truth. Divine good from the Lord is called “the Father in the heavens,” and is here meant by “him that sat upon the throne”; and Divine truth from the Lord is called “the son of man,” but here “the lamb.” And because Divine good judges no one, but Divine truth judges, therefore it is here said that “the lamb"

      "text": "APOCALYPSE EXPLAINED 655 took the book from him that sat upon the throne.” That Divine good judges no one, but Divine truth judges, is meant by the Lord’s words in John: The Father doth not judge anyone, but hath given all judgment unto the son; because he is the son of man (John 5:22, 27). “Father” means the Lord in respect to Divine good; “the son of man,” the Lord in respect to Divine truth. Divine good “doth not judge anyone,” because it explores no one; but Divine truth judges, for it explores everyone. Yet it should be known, that neither does the Lord himself judge anyone from the Divine truth that proceeds from him, for this is so united to Divine good that they are one; but the man-spirit judges himself; for it is the Divine truth received by himself that judges him; but because the appearance is that the Lord judges, therefore it is said in the Word that all are judged by the Lord. This the Lord also teaches in John: Jesus said, If any man hear my words and yet believe not, I judge him not; for I have not come to judge the world but to save the world. He that rejecteth me and receiveth not my words hath one that judgeth him; the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day (John 12:47–48). [2] For in respect to judgment, the case is this: the Lord is present with all, and from Divine love he wills to save all, and he turns and leads all towards himself. Those who are in good and in truths therefrom follow, for they apply themselves, but those who are in evil and in falsities therefrom do not follow, but turn backwards from the Lord, and to turn themselves backwards from the Lord is to turn from heaven to hell; for every man-spirit is either his own good and the truth therefrom, or his own evil and the falsity therefrom. He who is a good and the truth therefrom permits himself to be led by the Lord; but he who is an evil and the falsity therefrom does not permit himself to be led; he resists with all his strength and endeavor, for his will is toward his own love; for this love is his breath and life; therefore his desire is toward those who are in a like love of evil. From this it can be seen that the Lord does not judge anyone, but that Divine truth received judges to heaven"

Thence it is clear what is meant by the Lord’s saying that “all judgment is given to the son, because he is the son of man,” and elsewhere, that “he came not to judge the world but to save the world,” and that the Word which he has spoken is to judge man.” [3] These, however, are truths that do not fall into man’s self- intelligence, for they are among the arcana of the wisdom of angels. (But the matter is somewhat elucidated in Heaven and Hell, n. 545–551, under the heading, The Lord casts no one into hell, but the spirit casts himself thither.) That it is the Lord who is meant by “him that sat upon the throne,” and not another whom some distinguish from the Lord and call “God the Father,” can be seen by anyone from this, that the Divine that the Lord called “Father” was no other than his own Divine; for this took on the human; consequently it was the Father of the human; and that this Divine is infinite, eternal, uncreate, omnipotent, God, Lord, and in no way differing from the Divine itself that some distinguish from him and call the Father, can be seen from the received faith called Athanasian, where it is also said: That no one of them is greatest or least, and no one of them first or last, but they are altogether equal; and that as is one, so is the other, infinite, eternal, uncreate, omnipotent, God, Lord; and yet there are not three infinites, but one; not three eternals, but one; not three uncreates, but one; not three omnipotents, but one; not three Gods and Lords, but one. These things have been said that it may be known that by “him that sat upon the throne” and “the lamb,” also in what follows by “God” and “the lamb,” not two, distinct from each other, are meant; but that by the one, Divine good is meant, and by the other, Divine truth in heaven, both proceeding from the Lord. That the Lord is meant by “him that sat upon the throne,” is clear also from the particulars of chapter 4 preceding, where the throne and one sitting thereon are treated of (which may be seen explained, n. 258–295); and still further in Matthew:"

Also in Ezekiel: Above the expanse that was over the head of the cherubim was as it were the appearance of a sapphire stone, the likeness of a throne; and upon the likeness of the throne a likeness as the appearance of a man sitting upon it (Ezek. 1:26; 10:1). And in Isaiah: I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filling the temple (Isa. 6:1). [4] Since by “throne” heaven is signified, and by “him that sat upon the throne” the Lord in respect to his Divine in heaven, it is said above, in chapter 3: He that overcometh, I will give to him to sit with me on my throne (Rev. 3:21); signifying that he shall be in heaven where the Lord is (see above, n. 253b); and therefore in what follows in this chapter it is said: I saw, and behold in the midst of the throne a lamb standing (Rev. 5:6); and in chapter 22: He showed me a river of water of life, going forth out of the throne of God and of the lamb (Rev. 22:1). “The throne of God and of the lamb” means heaven and the Lord there in respect to Divine good and as to Divine truth; “God” meaning the Lord in respect to Divine good; and “the lamb,” the Lord in respect to Divine truth.

Those that receive Divine truth in good are saved; but those that receive Divine truth (which is the Word) not in good are not saved, since all Divine truth is in good and not elsewhere; consequently those that do not receive it in good reject it and deny it, if not openly yet tacitly, and if not with the mouth yet with the heart; for the heart of such is evil, and evil rejects. To receive Divine truth in good is to receive it in the good of charity; for those who are in that good receive. 298a. “Right hand,” in reference to the Lord, signifies both omnipotence and omniscience, for the reason that in heaven the south is on the right and the north on the left; and the “south” signifies Divine truth in light, and the “north” Divine truth in shade; and as Divine good has all power through Divine truth, “right hand” in reference to the Lord signifies omnipotence, and as Divine good has all intelligence and wisdom through Divine truth, and to the right in heaven Divine truth is in light (as was said), so “right hand” in reference to the Lord also signifies omniscience. (That in heaven the south is on the right, and there Divine truth is in light, and those who are there are in intelligence and wisdom; and that the north is on the left, and Divine truth there is in shade, see Heaven and Hell, where the four quarters in heaven are treated of, n. 141–153; that all power is from Divine good through Divine truth, see the same work, where the power of the angels of heaven is treated of, n. 228–233; then that all intelligence and wisdom is also from Divine good through Divine truth, see the same work, where the wisdom of the angels of heaven is treated of, n. 265–275; and the Wise and simple in heaven, n. 346–356.) 298b. [2] That “right hand” in reference to the Lord signifies both omnipotence and omniscience, and in reference to men power and wisdom, can be seen from the following passages. In David: The north and the right hand thou hast created them; Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy name. Thou hast an arm with might; strong is thy hand; thy right hand shall be exalted. Justice and judgment are the support of thy throne; mercy and truth shall stand together before thy faces (Ps. 89:12–14)."

Because both omnipotence and omniscience are signified, it is said, “Tabor and Hermon,” “justice and judgment,” “mercy and truth.” By “Tabor and Hermon” those in Divine good and those in Divine truth are signified; by “justice and judgment,” and in a like manner by “mercy and truth,” Divine good and Divine truth are signified; the two together signify in the spiritual sense Divine good through Divine truth. Omnipotence and omniscience, which Divine good has through Divine truth, are signified by “thou hast an arm with might,” and by “strong is thy hand; thy right hand shall be exalted.” [3] In the same: If I shall forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget (Ps. 137:5). “Jerusalem” signifies the church in respect to the doctrine of Divine truth; and the “right hand of Jehovah,” Divine truth in light, since (as was said above) those are at the right hand of the Lord in heaven who are in light and in wisdom from Divine truth; thence it is evident why it is said, “If I shall forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget.” [4] In the same: Behold, I am brutish, I know not. But I am continually with thee; thou hast held my right hand. Thou leadest me in thy counsel, and afterwards receivest me with glory (Ps. 73:22–24). Since “right hand,” in reference to man, signifies wisdom from Divine truth, it is said, “I am brutish, I know not. Thou leadest me in thy counsel, and afterwards receivest me with glory,” “to lead in counsel” meaning to lead by Divine truth, and “to receive with glory” meaning to make blessed with intelligence; “glory” in"

[5] In the same: Jehovah is thy keeper; Jehovah is thy shade upon thy right hand. The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night (Ps. 121:5, 6). “To be a shade on the right hand” signifies to be a defense against evil and falsity. “Shade” stands here for a shady place to preserve from hurt, and “right hand” for power and wisdom from Divine truth, which would be hurt by evil and falsity unless the Lord defended. Because this is what is signified it is said, “the sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night,” the “sun” here signifying the love of self and thence all evil, and the “moon” the falsity of evil. (That this is the signification of “sun” and “moon” see Heaven and Hell, n. 122, 123; and Arcana Coelestia, n. 2441, 7078, 8487, 9755, 10130, 10189, 10420, 10702.)

[7] In the same: Gird the sword upon the thigh, O mighty one, with thy splendor and in thine honor; in thine honor mount, ride on the Word of truth, of gentleness, and of righteousness; thy right hand shall teach thee wonderful things.

It is also said, “in thine honor mount, ride on the Word of truth,” “in honor to mount” signifying to combat from Divine good, and “to ride upon the Word of truth” signifying to combat from Divine truth, thus from Divine good through Divine truth. The Lord’s omnipotence and omniscience are signified by “thy right hand shall teach thee wonderful things”; “kings’ daughters, who are among the precious ones” signify the affections of truth; and “the queen who is on the right hand in the best gold of Ophir” signifies heaven and the church and those therein who are in truths from good; the “right hand” meaning truth in light, and “gold of Ophir” the good of love. [8] In the same: The saying of Jehovah to my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand until I shall make thine enemies a stool for thy feet. The Lord at thy right hand hath stricken through kings in the day of his anger (Ps. 110:1, 5; Matt. 22:44; Mark 12:36; Luke 20:42–43). It is known that these things were said of the Lord; they are a description of the Lord’s combats, in the world against the hells, and their subjugation which was effected from Divine good through Divine truth; “right hand” here signifies Divine truth; it is therefore said “until I shall make thine enemies a stool for thy feet”; “enemies” signifying the hells; “making them a stool for thy feet” signifying to subjugate altogether; “the Lord at thy right hand hath stricken through kings in the day of his anger” has a like signification; “day of anger” being a state of combat, and “kings” those who are in falsities from evil. That the Lord, when he was in the world, put on Divine truth from Divine good, and that he thereby subjugated the hells and disposed all things in heaven into order, see Last Judgment (n. 46); and in the Doctrine of the New Jerusalem (n. 293–294, 301, 303)."

[10] In Isaiah: I have strengthened thee, yea, I have helped thee, [yea, I have upheld thee,] by the right hand of my righteousness.

So there appeared to Zechariah the angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense (Luke 1:11); And an angel was seen in the tomb where the Lord had been, sitting on the right side (Mark 16:5–6); And for the same reason the sheep are said to have been set on the right hand, and the goats on the left (Matt. 25:33–34 seq.); “sheep” here being those who are in truths from good, or in the faith of truth from the good of charity; and “goats” being those who are in faith without charity, which faith is called faith alone, and regarded in itself is no faith. [14] Because of this signification of “right hand” when Aaron and his sons were inaugurated into the priesthood: Blood was sprinkled upon their right ear and upon their right hand, and upon the great toe of the right foot (Exod. 29:20); “blood” here signifying Divine truth from Divine good; “the right ear” the ability to perceive truth from good; “the right hand” and “the right foot” understanding and power of truth from good in the internal or spiritual man and in the external or natural man; and “great toe” fullness.

In Revelation: They who should receive the mark of the beast on the right hand or on the forehead (Rev. 13:16; 14:9). The “right hand” in reference to evil, signifies falsity, and consequent reasoning and combat against truth, because with those who are in evil and with those who are in good the quarters are opposite; therefore to the right hand of those in evil truths are in dense darkness, but falsities, as it were, in the greatest light.

This is evident from the signification of “book,” here the “book of life,” as being what the Lord inscribes or implants in the spirit of man, that is, in the heart and soul, or what is the same, in his love and faith (of which see above, n. 199); therefore “the book” here signifies the states of life of all in heaven and on the earth, and “written” signifies what is implanted by the Lord (that to “write” signifies to implant, see also above, n. 222). Also from the signification of “within and on the back,” as being what is in the heart and soul, or in the love and faith; for with man and spirit love is within, because it makes his life; but faith, unless it is in his love, is not within him, but behind or “at the back”; for faith that is faith makes altogether one with the love, since what a man loves is of his faith, but what he does not love is not of his faith. That which one thinks from memory and teaches from doctrine, appears, indeed, to be faith; but if this be loved only from a natural, not from a"

Faith implanted in the internal man and its love is believing and loving the truth because it is truth, and not loving it chiefly for the sake of a reputation for learning, and honor or gain therefrom. From this it can be seen what is signified by “written within and on the back.” [2] What is treated of in this chapter is, that the Lord only, and no one but the Lord, knows the states of life of all in general and of each one in particular. This is representatively depicted by “a book written which no one was able to open and read, neither to look thereon, except the lamb,” that is, the Lord. No one knows this but the Lord alone, because he is the only God, and because he formed the angelic heaven after his own image, and man after the image of heaven; for this reason he knows all things of heaven in general, and he who knows all things of heaven in general knows also every one in particular; for a man who is in truths from good, as well as an angel, is an image of heaven, since he is a form of heaven. From this it also follows that no one but he who knows the general state of all knows the state of anyone in particular, for the one is inseparably connected with the other. (But as these things cannot be described in a few words, see what is shown in Heaven and Hell, where they are more distinctly and clearly described, in the following articles: the divine of the Lord makes heaven, n. 7–12; every angel is a heaven in the least form, n. 51–58; the whole heaven in the complex has reference to one man, n. 59–67; likewise each society there, n. 68–72; every angel, therefore, is in a perfect human form, n. 73–77; from the divine human of the Lord it is that heaven in the whole and in part has reference to man, n. 78–86; there is a correspondence of all things of heaven with all things of man, n. 87–102; on the conjunction of heaven with mankind, n. 291–302.)

And in David: Then said I, Lo, I am come; in the roll of the book it is written of me (Ps. 40:7). For this reason it is said in Isaiah: All the host of the heavens shall waste away, and the heavens shall be rolled up as a scroll (Isa. 34:4). Likewise in Revelation: Heaven was removed, as a book that is rolled up (Rev. 6:14). From this it can be known how the book that John saw was “written within and on the back.” 300. Sealed up with seven seals, signifies altogether hidden, namely, the state of life of all in heaven and on the earth. This is evident from the signification of “sealed with seals,” as being to be hidden, for what is contained in a book sealed up with seals no one knows until it is opened and read; also from the signification of “seven,” as being all persons and all things, also what is full and entire (see above, n. 257); thus also altogether, because this means fully and wholly. 301.

Verse 2. And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a great voice, signifies exploration by the influx of the Lord into heaven. This is evident from the signification of a “strong angel,” as being heaven (of which presently); also from the signification of “proclaiming with a great voice,” as being exploration by the influx of the Lord, namely, exploration whether anyone is able to know the states of life of all in heaven and on the earth in general and in particular, for this is what is here treated of. This is signified by “proclaiming,” and the influx of the Lord is signified by “a great voice”; for “voice,” in reference to the Lord, signifies every truth of the Word, of doctrine, and of faith from him; and in reference to heaven and the church, it signifies every thought and affection thence; and since everything true and good that angels in heaven and men in whom the church is, think and are affected by, is from the influx of the Lord, this is what is here signified by “a great voice.” For it is well known, that no one from the love of good can be affected by good, and from the love of truth can think truth, of himself, but that this flows in from heaven, that is, through heaven from the Lord; and because this is so, “a great voice” signifies the influx of the Lord. (That “voice” in the Word signifies the truth of the Word, of doctrine, and of faith, also everything announced in the Word, see above, n. 261, and Arcana Coelestia, n. 3563, 6971, 8813, 9926; and that it signifies the interior affection of truth and good, and thought therefrom, n. 10454.) A “strong angel” signifies heaven because the whole angelic heaven before the Lord is as one man, or as one angel, likewise each society of heaven; therefore by “angel” in the Word an angel is not meant, but an entire angelic society, as by “Michael,” “Gabriel,” “Raphael.” Here, therefore, “a strong angel proclaiming with a great voice” signifies the influx of the Lord into the whole heaven. That it is into the whole heaven is clear from what follows, for it is said, “And no one was able, in"

Who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof? signifies, is there anyone there such as to know and to perceive the states of life of all? This is evident from the signification of “Who is worthy?” as being, is there anyone who has merit and righteousness, and who has omniscience, thus whether there is any such? That “worthy,” in reference to the Lord, signifies merit and righteousness, which belong to him alone, see above (n. 293). And that omniscience is signified is clear from what follows, where it is said, “the lamb took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne, and opened it”; for “right hand” signifies omniscience and omnipotence (see above, n. 297); it is evident also from the signification of the “book,” as being the states of life of all in general and in particular (of which see just above, n. 299); and also from the signification of “to open the book and to loose the seals thereof,” as being to know and perceive; for when the “book” signifies the states of life of all, “to open and to loose the seals” signifies to know and perceive those states; for knowing and perceiving are predicated of the state of life, but opening and loosening seals relate to a book; thus the words in the internal sense conform to the things signified by the words in the sense of the letter, for they correspond; therefore, “to open” signifies to know, and “to loose the seals” signifies to perceive what is altogether hidden from others (as above, n. 300). 304a.

And as heaven is heaven from the Divine truth that flows in from the Lord and is received by the angels, and not at all from any self-intelligence of the angels, for this is no intelligence, so the same words signify that no one has any knowledge or perception whatever from himself. That angels in heaven as well as men in the world have a selfhood [proprium], which regarded in itself is nothing but evil, see Heaven and Hell (n. 592), and as evil receives nothing of intelligence and wisdom, it follows that angels equally with men understand nothing at all of truth from themselves, but solely from the Lord. Angels are such for the reason that all angels are from the human race, and every man retains after death what is his own [suum proprium], and angels are withheld from the evils that pertain to what is their own [proprii eorum] and are kept in goods by the Lord. (That all angels are from the human race, and not one is created such from the beginning, see Last Judgment, n. 14–22; and that they are all withheld from evil, and kept in good by the Lord, see Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, n. 166.)

For in the spiritual world, where the spirits and angels are, it is just as it is in the natural world where men are, that is, there are lands, hills, and mountains; and in appearance the resemblance is such that there is no difference at all; therefore men after death scarcely know otherwise than that they are still living on the earth, and when the privilege is granted them to look into our world, they see nothing dissimilar. Moreover, the angels who are in the lowest heaven call that heaven where the angels of the third heaven dwell, because it is high above them, and"

From this it can be seen what is here meant, specifically, by “in heaven,” “upon the earth,” and “under the earth.” (But more can be seen on this subject in Heaven and Hell, where appearances in heaven are treated of, n. 170–176; and the habitations and dwelling places of angels, n. 183–189.) 304b. [3] As men have not known that there is a like surface of the earth in both worlds, the natural and the spiritual, therefore they have not perceived otherwise when they have read the Word than that “heaven” and “earth” there mean the heaven visible before our eyes, and the earth inhabited by men; from this arose the belief in the destruction of heaven and earth, and the creation of a new heaven and a new earth at the day of the last judgment; when yet “heaven” and “earth” there mean the heaven and the earth where spirits and angels dwell, and in the spiritual sense the church with angels and with men (for there is a church with angels equally as with men, as may be seen in Heaven and Hell, n. 221–227). It is said, in the spiritual sense, for an angel is not an angel, nor is a man a man, from the human form, which both have, but because of heaven and the church with them. This is why “heaven” and “earth,” where angels and men dwell, signify the church; “heaven” the internal church and also the church with angels, and “earth”1 the external church and also the church with men. But since it can only with difficulty be believed that “earth” in the Word means the church, because it is not yet known that in every particular of the Word there is a spiritual sense, whence a material idea adheres and keeps the thought fixed in the nearest meaning of the expression, I wish to illustrate and confirm it by a number of quotations.

A shout over the wine in the streets; the gladness of the earth shall be banished; it shall be in the midst of the earth as the shaking of an olive tree, as the gleanings when the vintage is ended. From the uttermost part of the earth we have heard songs, Glory to the righteous. The floodgates from on high are opened, and the foundations of the earth quake; in breaking the earth is broken, in rending the earth is rent asunder, in moving the earth is moved; in tottering the earth shall totter as one drunken; and it shall be moved to and fro as a veil; but it shall be in that day that Jehovah will visit upon the host of the height in the height, and upon the kings of the earth who are upon the earth (Isa. 24:1, 3–6, 11, 13, 16, 18–21). Here it is very clear that “earth” does not mean the earth, but the church. Let the particulars be run over and considered. One who is in a spiritual idea does not think, when “earth” is mentioned, of the earth itself, but of the people on it and their quality; still more is this true of those who are in heaven; who, since they are spiritual, perceive that the church is meant. Here the church destroyed is treated of; its destruction in respect to the good of love and the truth of faith, which constitute it, is described by “Jehovah maketh the earth empty and maketh it void,” “in emptying the earth shall be emptied, in spoiling it shall be spoiled,” “it shall mourn and be confounded,” “it shall be profaned,” and “a malediction shall devour it”; “the floodgates from on high are opened, and the foundations of it quake”; “it is broken,” “it is rent asunder,” “it is moved,” “it shall totter as one drunken.” These things can be said neither of the earth, nor of any nation, but only of the church.

It is clear from the particulars understood in the spiritual sense, that “earth” here means the church. The end of the church is here treated of, when truth and good, or faith and charity, are no more. For “the stars and constellations that do not cause their light to shine” signify the knowledges of truth and good; the “sun that has been darkened in its rising” signifies love; the “moon that maketh not bright her light” signifies faith; a “man made more rare than fine gold” signifies intelligence and wisdom; this makes clear what is signified by “Behold, the day of Jehovah cometh to lay the earth waste. I will cause the heavens to tremble and the earth shall quake out of its place”; “the day of Jehovah” is the last end of the church, when there is the judgment; the “earth” is the church. It can be seen that the earth itself does not quake out of its place, but that the church is removed when love and faith are not. “To quake out of its place” signifies to be removed from its former state. [6] In the same: Behold, the Lord, as a deluge of hail, a storm of slaughter, as a deluge of mighty waters. He shall cast down to the earth with the hand. A consummation and decision I have heard from the Lord Jehovih of hosts upon the whole earth (Isa. 28:2, 22). This is said of the day of judgment upon those who are of the church. The day of judgment, when the church is at an end is meant by “a consummation and decision I have heard from the Lord Jehovih of Hosts upon the whole earth”; it is therefore said “as a deluge of hail, a storm of slaughter, as a deluge of mighty waters. He shall cast down to the earth with the hand”; by “hail” and “a deluge of it” falsities that destroy the truths of the church are signified; by “slaughter,” and “a storm of it,” evils that destroy the goods of the church are signified; by “mighty waters” falsities of evil are signified. (That a “deluge” or “flood” signifies immersion into evils and falsities, and the consequent destruction of the church) see Arcana Coelestia, n. 660, 705, 739, 756, 790, 5725,"

This is the signification of “mountains” and “hills,” because those who are in love to the Lord dwell upon mountains in heaven, and those who are in charity towards the neighbor, upon hills (see what has been said above, also in Heaven and Hell, n. 188, and note 6). “The heavens where there was no light, and that were black” signify the interiors of the men of the church, which, when closed by evils and falsities, do not admit light from heaven, but darkness from hell instead. From this it can be seen what is signified by “the lion and the destroyer of the nations making the land a waste”; so likewise by “I saw the earth, and lo, it was void and empty”; also by “the whole earth shall be a waste; for this shall the land mourn,” namely, that the earth is not meant, but the church.

Here “the land and the cities that shall be desolated and shall be a waste” have the same signification as above, namely, “the land” signifies the church, and “cities” doctrine with its truths; it is therefore said, “because of the violence of all them that dwell therein.” Since this is what is meant, it is first said that “they shall eat their bread with carefulness, and drink their waters with astonishment,” “bread” and “water” in the Word signifying all the good of love and truth of faith (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 9323), and “eating” and “drinking” signifying instruction and appropriation (n. 3168, 3513, 3832, 9412).

It can be seen that these things are said of the church, and not of the earth, for it is said, “thou hast made the earth to quake, thou hast broken it up; heal the breaches thereof, for it is moved”; and as “the earth” signifies the church, and here the church vastated, it is said, “O God, thou hast cast us off, thou hast been angry; bring back rest to us.” [19] In the same: When I shall receive the set time, I shall judge with uprightness. The earth and all the inhabitants thereof shall be dissolved; I will make firm the pillars of it (Ps. 75:23). Here, likewise, the “earth” stands for the church, which is said to “dissolve” when the truths by which there is good fail; truths, because they support the church, are called its “pillars,” which God will make firm; it is not the pillars of the earth evidently that are made firm. As the restoration of the church is here described, it is said, “When I shall receive the set time, I shall judge with uprightness.” The truths of the church, here called the “pillars of the earth,” are also called the “bases of the earth” (1 Sam. 2:8); and the “foundations of the earth,” in Isaiah: Do ye not understand the foundations of the earth? It is he that dwelleth upon the circle of the earth, that bringeth the princes to nothing; and maketh the judges of the earth as emptiness (Isa. 40:21–23). The “princes who will be brought to nothing,” and the “judges of the earth, whom he will make as emptiness” signify the things that are from self-intelligence and from one’s own judgment.

Thus said Jehovah, Behold, evil shall go forth from nation to nation, and a great tempest shall be stirred up from the sides of the earth. And the slain of Jehovah shall be in that day from the end of the earth even unto the end thereof (Jer. 25:31–33). The “end of the earth” and the “sides of the earth” signify where the ultimates of the church are, and where evils and falsities begin; and “from the end of the earth to the end thereof” signifies all things of the church; from this it can be known what is signified by “a tumult shall come to the end of the earth,” and “a great tempest shall be stirred up from the sides of the earth,” also by “the slain of Jehovah in that day shall be from the end of the earth to the end thereof.” The “slain” signify those in whom the truths and goods of the church are extinguished (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 4503). 304d. [21] In Isaiah: The isles saw, they feared; the ends of the earth trembled, they drew near, and came. I will make the wilderness into a pool of waters, and the dry land into a spring of waters (Isa. 41:5, 18). The establishment of the church among the Gentiles is thus described; they are signified by the “isles” and the “ends of the earth”; for “isles” and “the ends of the earth” in the Word signify those who are far removed from the truths and goods of the church because they do not have the Word, and consequently, are in ignorance. That a church is to be established with such is signified by “I will make the wilderness into a pool of waters, and the dry land into a spring of waters.” That is called a “wilderness” where there is not yet good because there is not yet truth, and for the same reason it is called “dry land”; a “pool of waters” and a “spring of waters” signify good, because they signify truth; for all spiritual good, which is the good of the church, is acquired by means of truths.

No one knows what is meant by “a land shadowed with wings,” and “a land that the rivers have despoiled,” unless he knows that “land” means the church, and “rivers” falsities; “a land shadowed with wings” is a church that is in thick darkness in respect to Divine truths (that these are signified by “wings,” see above, n. 283); “beyond the rivers of Cush” signifies in respect to the knowledges themselves from the sense of the letter of the Word, which have been falsified; “a nation trodden down, to which the messengers should go, whose land the rivers have despoiled” signifies those out of the church who are in falsities from ignorance; “rivers” meaning the truths of doctrine, and in a contrary sense falsities; that “the messengers should go to them” signifies that they should be invited to receive the church. [23] In the same: In the fury of Jehovah of hosts the land is obscured (Isa. 9:19). A “land obscured” signifies the things of the church in thick darkness, that is, in falsities; for the falsities of evil are said to be in thick darkness, but truths in light. [24] In the same: Jehovah shall remove man, and forsaken places shall be multiplied in the midst of the land (Isa. 6:12); “man whom Jehovah shall remove” signifying him who is wise, and abstractly, wisdom (as may be seen above, n. 280); “forsaken places multiplied in the midst of the land” signifying that there shall be no good at all, because no truth; “the midst of the land” meaning where truth is in the highest light; consequently when there is no light there, thick darkness pervades the whole; thus there is nowhere any truth at all."

[26] In the same: The earth is at rest, and is quiet. Hell hath stirred up the Rephaim because of thee, all the powerful of the earth. They that see thee shall say, Is this the man that maketh the earth to tremble, that maketh the kingdoms to quake; that hath made the world as a wilderness and threw down the cities thereof? Thou hast destroyed thy land, thou hast slain thy people. Prepare slaughter for his sons, that they rise not up and possess the land, and the faces of the world be filled with cities. I will break the Assyrian in my land, and upon my mountains I will tread him down (Isa. 14:7, 9, 16–17, 20–21, 25). These things are said of the king of Babylon, by whom is signified the destruction of truth by the love of ruling over heaven and earth; which love the truths of the Word or of the church are made to serve as means; here their damnation is treated of. The “Rephaim whom hell stirred up,” mean those who are in the direful persuasion of what is false, who are therefore called the powerful of the earth; “to make the earth to tremble,” “to make the kingdoms quake,” “to make the world as a wilderness,” and “to throw down the cities thereof” signifies to pervert all things of the church; “earth” and “world” mean the church, “kingdoms” the truths that constitute it; and “cities” all things of doctrine. From this it is clear what is signified by, “thou hast destroyed thy land, thou hast slain thy people.” The “Assyrian who shall be broken in the land and trodden down upon the mountains” signifies the reasonings from falsities against truths; “to be broken” means to be dispersed, and"

Neither ships of Tarshish, nor Tyre, nor the land of Chittim, nor the land of the Chaldeans, nor Assyria, are here meant, as can be seen from the particulars in this chapter; but “the ships of Tarshish” mean the knowledges of truth and good, “Tyre” the like; “the land of Chittim” what is idolatrous; “the land of the Chaldeans” the profanation and destruction of truth, and “Assyria” reasoning from falsities. From this it is clear that, “Howl, ye ships of Tarshish, for Tyre is desolated” signifies that there were no longer any knowledges of truth; “from the land of Chittim it shall manifestly come to them” signifies idolatry therefrom; “the girdle is no more” signifies that there is no longer any coherence of truth with good; “behold the land of the Chaldeans” signifies that thus there is profanation and destruction of truth; “Assyria hath founded it into heaps” signifies that reasonings from falsities have destroyed it; “to return to the hire of whoredom” and “to commit whoredom with all kingdoms upon the faces of the ground” signifies the falsification of all truths of the whole church.

[32] In the same: I have given thee for a covenant to the people, to restore the earth. Sing aloud O heavens, and exult O earth, and break forth O mountains with a song (Isa. 49:8, 13). This treats of the Lord and his coming; the establishment of the church by him is described by “I have given thee for a covenant of the people, to restore the earth,” to “restore the earth” being to reestablish the church; it is known that the Lord did not restore the earth to the Jewish people, but that he established a church among the Gentiles; the joy in consequence is described by, “Sing aloud O heavens, and exult O earth, and break forth O mountains with a song,” “the heavens” being the heavens where angels are who are in the interior truths of the church, “the earth” the church among men, and “the mountains” those who are in the good of love to the Lord. 304e.

[35] In Ezekiel: The end hath come upon the four quarters of the earth; the earth is full of the judgment of bloods, and the city is full of violence (Ezek. 7:2, 23). “The end hath come upon the four quarters of the earth” signifies the last time and the last state of the church, when its end is, the four quarters being all truths and goods of the church, and in a contrary sense, all its falsities and evils, thus all things of the church; “the earth full of the judgment of bloods” signifies that it is filled with evils of every kind, “bloods” being the evils that offer violence to the goods of love and charity and wholly destroy them; “the city full of violence” signifies the doctrine of that church likewise offering violence.

That this is the meaning can be seen from what was said at the beginning of this article, namely, that those in heaven who are in the good of love to the Lord dwell upon mountains, those who are in charity towards the neighbor upon hills, and those who are in goods and truths in the lowest heaven in plains and valleys; “watercourses” are the truths of doctrine there; to implant these is signified by “I will turn unto you that ye may be tilled and sown.” [38] In Hosea: In that day I will hear the heavens, and they shall hear the earth; and the earth shall hear the corn and the new wine and the oil, and these shall hear Jezreel,3 and I will sow her unto me in the earth (Hos. 2:21–23). Evidently these things are to be understood spiritually, and not naturally according to the sense of the letter, for it is said that “these shall hear Jezreel; and I will sow her unto me in the earth”; therefore the “heavens” mean the heavens where the Lord is; and the “earth” the church where also the Lord is; “corn, new wine, and"

These things are said of those with whom is the church; and because “the fruit of the ground,” and “the vine in the field” signify the goods and truths of the church (“fruit” goods, and “the vine” its truths), therefore they are called “a land of good pleasure.” [40] In David: Let thy good spirit lead me into the land of uprightness; vivify me, O Jehovah, for thy name’s sake (Ps. 143:10–11). “The land of uprightness” stands for the church in which is the right and the true; and because “the spirit of Jehovah” signifies Divine truth, and everyone receives spiritual life through that, therefore it is said, “Let thy good spirit lead me,” and “vivify me, O Jehovah.” [41] As the “earth” signifies the church, and where the church is there is heaven, therefore heaven is called “the land of the living,” and “the land of life”; “the land of the living” in Isaiah: I said, I shall not see Jah in the land of the living (Isa. 38:11); and in Ezekiel: Who caused terror in the land of the living (Ezek. 32:23–27). “The land of life,” in David: Unless I had believed to see good in the land of life (Ps. 27:13)."

Those who honor father and mother have heaven and the happiness there, because in heaven no other father but the Lord is known, for all there have been generated anew from him; and in heaven by “mother” the church is meant, and in general, the kingdom of the Lord. It is clear that those who worship the Lord and seek his kingdom will have life in heaven, also that many of those who honor father and mother in the world do not live there long.

It shall come to pass in that day, by reason of the abundance of milk they yield, he shall eat butter; for butter and honey shall everyone eat that is left in the midst of the land (Isa. 7:14–16, 21–22). It is known that these things were said respecting the Lord and his coming; “butter and honey,” which he shall eat, signify the goods of love; “butter” the good of celestial and spiritual love, “honey” the good of natural love; this means that he would appropriate the Divine to himself even in respect to the human; “to eat” signifying to appropriate. That “the land shall be forsaken before he knoweth to reject the evil and to choose the good” signifies that when he should be born there would not be anything of the church remaining in the whole world; and because those where the church was, rejected every Divine truth and perverted all things of the Word, and explained it in favor of self, it is said of the land, that is, the church, “which thou abhorrest from the presence of its two kings; “king” signifying the truths of heaven and of the church; “two kings” the truth of the Word in the internal or spiritual sense, and the truth of the Word in the external or natural sense. “Milk” signifies truth through which good comes, and as “butter” signifies the good therefrom, “by reason of the abundance of yielding milk, butter shall everyone eat that is left in the midst of the land” signifies that every truth shall be from good. 304f.

That day as a snare shall come upon all that dwell upon the face of the whole earth (Luke 21:25–26, 35). Here also the last time of the church is treated of, when judgment takes place, and the “earth” and the “world” here mean the church. “The distress of nations upon the earth,” “the fear and expectation of the things coming upon the earth, and upon all who dwell upon the face of the whole earth” signifies upon those who are in the spiritual world, not upon those who are in the countries in the natural world. (That there are lands in the spiritual world also, see what is said at the beginning of this article; and that the last judgment was accomplished there, see Last Judgment.) It has been told before what “sun,” “moon,” and “stars” signify, in which are signs, namely, that “sun” signifies love, “moon” faith therefrom, and “stars” the knowledges of good and truth; the “sea and waves roaring” signify the reasonings and assaults of truth from the sense of the letter of the Word, wrongly and perversely applied. The “powers of the heavens that shall be shaken” signify the Word in the sense of the letter, since this sense is the foundation of the spiritual truths that are in the heavens.

Things internal are signified by “the heavens,” things external by “the lower parts of the earth”; “mountains” mean the good of love, the “forest” means natural truth, and the “trees” therein mean the knowledges of truth. Because such things are signified, it is said, “for Jehovah hath redeemed Jacob,” “Jacob” in the Word signifying the external church, and “Israel” the internal church; “to stretch forth the heavens,” and “to spread abroad the earth” signifies the church on all sides, which is spread forth and extended by the multiplication of truth and the fructification of good, with those who are of the church. [49] In Zechariah: Jehovah stretcheth out the heavens, and foundeth the earth, and formeth the spirit of man in the midst of him (Zech. 12:1). Here, too, in like manner “heavens” and “earth” signify the church everywhere, thus in respect to its interiors and as to its exteriors; therefore it is also said, “he formeth the spirit of man in the midst of him.” [50] In Jeremiah: The gods that have not made the heaven and the earth, let them perish from the earth and from under the heavens.

Because “heaven” and “earth” signify the church, and the church is formed by truths, and the truths of the church constitute intelligence, it is said, “Jehovah maketh the heavens by intelligence, and spreadeth out the earth above the waters,” “waters” meaning the truths of the church.

[54] In the same: Behold, I create new heavens and a new earth, and the former shall not be remembered (Isa. 65:17). “To create new heavens and a new earth” signifies to establish a new church in respect to its interiors and exteriors, both in the heavens and on earth (as above). [55] In the same: Who hath heard a thing like this? shall the earth bring forth in one day? shall a nation be begotten at one time? For as the new heavens and the new earth which I am about to make shall stand before me, so shall your seed and your name stand (Isa. 66:8, 22). Because the “earth” signifies the church, it is said, “shall the earth bring forth in one day? shall a nation be begotten at one time?” “To bring forth,” and “birth,” and “to beget,” and “begetting,” in the Word, signify spiritual birth and begetting, which are of faith and love, thus reformation and regeneration. What the “new heavens” and the “new earth” signify has been told above."

To “hold the four winds” signifies that truths and goods do not flow in because they are not received; therefore it is said that “the wind should not blow upon the earth.” “The earth” signifies the church elsewhere in Revelation (as 10:2, 5–6, 8; 12:16; 13:13; 16:2, 14; 20:8–9, 11; 21:1), as well as in many other places in the Word, too numerous to be cited. [59] As the church was signified by the “earth” and especially by the “land of Canaan,” because the church was there, and as the church which was there was a representative church, so all things there were representative, and all that was said to them by the Lord signified the spiritual or interior things of the church, and this even to the land itself and its products; as in these words in Moses: If thou wilt keep the commandments, Jehovah will lead thee into a good land, into a land of brooks of waters, of fountains, of depths coming forth out of valley and mountain; a land of wheat, of barley, of vine, of fig, of pomegranate; a land of the olive, of oil, of honey; a land where thou shalt eat bread without scarceness; it shall lack nothing; a land where the stones are iron and out of the mountains is digged copper; and thou shalt eat, and shalt be satisfied in this good land (Deut. 8:6–10). This is a description of all things of the church, both its interiors and its exteriors; but to explain what the particulars signify would be tedious and not to the present purpose. [60] Because the “land” signifies the church it was among the blessings, that if they lived according to the commandments: The land would yield its increase, evil beasts would cease out of the land, nor would the sword pass through the land (Lev. 26:3–4, 6). That “the land would yield its increase” signifies that there would be good and truth in the church; that “evil beasts would cease” signifies that there would not be evil affections and lusts, which"

It is therefore said also that: The land was defiled on account of their evils, and would vomit them out because of their abominations (Lev. 18:25–28). Because “land” signified the church: The Lord spat on the earth, and made clay of the spittle, and anointed the eyes of the blind man, and said, Go wash thee in the pool of Siloam (John 9:6–7, 11, 15); So the Lord, when the scribes and Pharisees questioned him respecting the woman taken in adultery, stooping down, wrote twice on the earth (John 8:6, 8); which signified that the church was full of adulteries, that is, full of the adulteration of good and the falsification of truth; therefore the Lord said to them: He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her; but they went out one by one, beginning from the elders, even unto the last (John 8:7, 9). [62] As most things in the Word have also a contrary sense, so has the “earth,” which in that sense signifies the church vastated; it is vastated when the good of love and the truth of faith are no more, but instead thereof evil and falsity; as these damn man, the “earth” in that sense signifies damnation, as in the following places: Isa. 14:12; 21:9; 25:12; 26:19, 21; 29:4; 47:1; 63:6; Lam. 2:2, 10; Ezek. 26:20; 32:24; Num. 16:29–33; 26:10; and elsewhere."

This arranging depends solely on the infinite wisdom of the one who knows all things, recognizes all things, and explores all things, and thence disposes and arranges all things. This one is the Lord alone; therefore it is said in the Word, that to him belongeth judgment; and that he has power in the heavens and on the earth; and here that “He took the book and loosed the seals thereof.” Moreover, unless heaven were in order, the world, that is, men on the earth, could not exist and subsist, since the world depends upon heaven and its influx into the spiritual and rational things of men; in a word, all things would perish. (But this may be better comprehended from what is set forth in Heaven and Hell, also in Last Judgment, and in fact, from everything there if read with attention.) It is said to know, to recognize, and to explore, because this is signified by “to open the book, to read, and to look thereon”; for the “book” signifies all things with man, spirit, and angel, or all the states of their life in respect to love and faith; therefore “to open the book” signifies to know these things; “to read the book” signifies to recognize them, and “to look upon the book” signifies to explore them. 307. Verse 5. And one of the elders, signifies a society of heaven superior in wisdom to the rest. This is evident from the signification of “elders,” as being those who are in truths from good, and abstractly truths from good (of which above, n. 270), thus those who are superior to the rest in intelligence and wisdom; for all intelligence is from good through truths, or through truths from good, and from no other source. “One of the elders” signifies a society of heaven because “an angel” in the Word does not mean one angel, but a whole society (see above, n. 90, 302); in like manner also “one of the elders.” A society superior in wisdom to the rest is meant, because this elder declared that it is the Lord alone who acquired to himself Divine wisdom in respect to the human in order that he might know, recognize, and explore everyone, and the states of the life of all in general, and of each one"

The others also know it, yet not by perception but by the illustration of the understanding. The angels of the third or inmost heaven have perception; angels of the second and of the last heaven have illustration of the understanding; the difference is this, that perception is full confirmation by influx from the Lord, but the illustration of the understanding is spiritual sight. This those have who are in charity towards the neighbor and in faith therefrom; but the former, namely, perception, those have who are in love to the Lord (see further what perception is, in Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, n. 135–140). 308. Saith unto me, Weep not, signifies there need be no grief on that account. This is evident from the signification of “weeping,” as being grief of heart, as above (n. 306), where also the reason for this may be seen. 309. Behold, the lion hath overcome, signifies that the Lord from his own power subjugated the hells, and reduced all things there and in the heavens to order. This is evident from the signification of “overcoming,” when predicated of the Lord, namely, that when he was in the world he subjugated the hells, and reduced all things there and in the heavens to order, and this by temptations admitted into his human, and then by continual victories (of which see in Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, n. 293, 294, 301, 309). This therefore is signified by “overcoming,” when predicated of the Lord; and as the Lord had done these things from his own power, he is called a “lion”; for “lion” signifies power (see above, n. 278).

The Divine that was in the Lord from conception was his own Divine, which in the Athanasian Creed is said to be equal to the Divine that is there called “the Father”; for it is said that: As is the Father so also is the son, infinite, uncreate, eternal, omnipotent, God, Lord, and that neither of them is greatest or least, nor first or last, but altogether equal. It is also said that: The Divine and human of the Lord are not two, but one person, and that as the soul and body make one man, so the Divine and the human are one Christ. From this also those who have faith in Athanasius may know that the Lord did these things from his own power, because from his Divine. From this it can clearly be seen what is meant by what the Lord says in John: The Father that abideth in me, he doeth the works. Believe me, that I am in the Father, and the Father in me (John 14:10–11). Verily I say unto you, the son can do nothing of himsel f, except what he seeth the Father doing; for whatever things he doeth, these also the son doeth in like manner. As the Father raiseth up the dead and quickeneth them, even so the son quickeneth whom he will. As the Father hath life in himself, so also gave he to the son to have life in himself (John 5:19, 21, 26). As the Divine, which the Lord calls “the Father,” was his Divine, and not another Divine, it can be seen that whatever he did from the Father, as well as whatever he did from the human which he calls “the son,” he did from himself; and thus that he did all things by his own power, since he did them from what was his. 310.

It is evident also from the signification of “the root of David,” as being Divine truth; for by “David” in the Word the Lord in respect to Divine truth is meant (see above, n. 205). Therefore “of the tribe of Judah, the root of David,” means the Lord in respect to Divine good united to Divine truth in his human. In the Word in the sense of its letter two expressions are mostly used, one involving good but the other truth; but in its internal or spiritual sense these two are joined into one, and this on account of the marriage of good and truth in every particular of the Word (of which see above, n. 238 at end, 288b); the reason is that good and truth in heaven are not two but one, for every truth there is of good. The Lord in respect to the human is called “the root of David,” for the reason that all Divine truth is from him, even as all things exist and subsist from their root; for the same reason also he is called “the root of Jesse,” in Isaiah: It shall be in that day that the root of Jesse, which standeth for a standard of the peoples, the nations shall seek; and his rest shall be glory (Isa. 11:10). “Jesse” here stands for David, because he was David’s father. 311.

Verse 6. And I saw, and behold, in the midst of the throne and of the four animals, and in the midst of the elders, signifies in the whole heaven, and especially in the inmost heavens. This is evident from the signification of “in the midst,” as being the inmost, and therefore the whole (of which presently); from the signification of “throne,” as being heaven in the whole complex (of which above, n. 253); from the signification of “the four animals” as being the Lord’s providence and guard that heaven be not approached except through the good of love (of which see above, n. 277); and as that guard is especially in the third or inmost heaven, since all who are there are in the good of love to the Lord from the Lord, that heaven is signified especially by “the four animals” (which will be more clearly seen from what follows in this chapter). It is also evident from the signification of “elders” as being those who are in truths from good (of which also see above n. 270); here, therefore, those who are in the middle or second heaven, since all who are there are in truths from good; for there are these two heavens, the third and second, distinguished from each other by this, that those in the third heaven are in love to the Lord, and those in the second in charity towards the neighbor; those in charity towards the neighbor are in truths from good.

This is so for the reason that angels are not angels from what is their own [ex proprio], but from the Divine good and the Divine truth that they receive; for it is the Divine with them, that is, the Divine received by them, that causes them to be angels, and causes heaven, which is made up of them, to be called heaven (see Heaven and Hell, n. 2–12, 51–86). [3] That “the midst” or “in the midst” signifies the inmost, and therefore the whole, can be seen from many passages in the Word; but first let something be said to explain whence it is that because “the midst” signifies the inmost it also signifies the whole. This may be illustrated by comparison with light, with the sun, with the arrangement of all in the heavens, and also of all who are of the church on earth. By comparison with light: light in the midst propagates itself round about or from the center to circumferences in every direction; and because from the inmost it is propagated and fills the spaces around, thence “in the midst” signifies also the whole. By comparison with the sun, the sun is in the midst because it is the center of its universe; because from it are the heat and light in its system, therefore the sun “in the midst” signifies its presence in every direction, or throughout the whole. By comparison with the arrangement of all in the heavens, there are three heavens, and the inmost of them is the third heaven; this flows into the two lower heavens, and makes them to be one with it by communication which is effected by influx from the inmost. Moreover, in every society of the heavens that which is inmost is also the most perfect; those, therefore, who are round about in that society are in light and intelligence according to their degree of distance from the inmost (see Heaven and Hell, n. 43, 50, 189). By comparison with those who are in the church on earth, the Lord’s church is spread through the whole world; but its inmost is where the Lord is known and acknowledged, and where the Word is; from that inmost, light and intelligence are propagated to all who are round about and are of the church, but this propagation of light"

In Isaiah: Cry out and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion, for great is the holy one of Israel in the midst of thee (Isa. 12:6). “Inhabitant of Zion” signifies the like as “daughter of Zion,” namely, the celestial church, that is the church that is in the good of love to the Lord; “great is the holy one of Israel in the midst of thee” signifies the Lord, that he is everywhere and throughout the whole there. [5] In David: We have considered thy mercy, O God, in the midst of thy temple.

From this it can be seen what is signified by “Israel shall be the third to Egypt and Assyria, a blessing in the midst of the land,” namely, that everything there shall be spiritual, both the rational and the recognizing and knowing faculty [cognitivum et scientificum]; for when the inmost is spiritual, which is truth from good, then the rational also which is therefrom is spiritual, and likewise the knowing faculty, for both are formed from the inmost, which is truth from good, or the spiritual.

The “midst of man” means the intellectual where truth should be; and the “heart” the voluntary where good should be; here, both of these perverted, the latter into evil, and the former into falsity. [14] In the same: There is no certainty in the mouth of anyone; perdition is their midst (Ps. 5:9). They bless with their mouth, but in their midst they curse (Ps. 62:4). The saying of the transgression to the wicked in the midst of my heart is, there is no dread of God before his eyes (Ps. 36:1). In Jeremiah: They have taught their tongue to speak a lie: their4 dwelling is in the midst of deceit; through deceit they refuse to know me (Jer. 9:5–6). Also in these and in many other passages, “in the midst” signifies in the whole, because in the inmost; for such as the inmost is, such is the whole; since from the inmost all the rest are brought forth and derived, as the body is from its soul; the inmost of everything is also what is called the soul. For example: the inmost of man is his will and understanding therefrom, and such as is the will and the understanding, thence, such is the whole man; so again, the inmost of man is his love and faith therefrom, and such as is his love and the faith, thence such is the whole man."

[15] That the whole man is such as his midst or inmost is, is also the meaning of the Lord’s words in Matthew: The lamp of the body is the eye; if the eye be good the whole body is light; if the eye be evil the whole body is darkened (Matt. 6:22–23). The “eye” signifies man’s understanding (see above, n. 37, 152), if this is good, that is, if it is made up of truths that are from good, the whole man is such, which is signified by “the whole body is light”; but on the other hand, if the understanding is made up of the falsities of evil, the whole man is such, as is signified by “the whole body is darkened.” The eye is called “good”; but in the Greek the eye is called “single,” and “single,” means that there is unity, and there is unity when truth is from good, or the understanding is from the will. Also, the “right eye” signifies the understanding of good, and the “left eye” the understanding of truth; if these make one, there is a “single eye,” thus a “good eye.” 314a. A lamb standing, signifies the Lord in respect to the Divine human. This is evident from the signification of “lamb,” as being, in reference to the Lord, himself in respect to the Divine human. The Lord in respect to the Divine human is called a “lamb” because a “lamb” signifies the good of innocence, and the good of innocence is the good itself of heaven proceeding from the Lord; and so far as angels receive this good, so far they are angels. This good reigns with angels that are in the third or inmost heaven; for this reason those in that heaven appear as infants before the eyes of other angels. (What the good of innocence is, and that the angels of heaven are in that good, see Heaven and Hell, in the chapter treating of the state of innocence of the angels of heaven, n. 276–283, also n. 285, 288, 341, 382.) It is believed in the world that the Lord is called “a lamb” for the reason that the continual burnt offering, or what was offered every day, evening and morning, was from lambs, and especially on the Passover days, when a lamb was also eaten; and that the Lord suffered himself to be sacrificed. Such a reason for his being so called may do for those in the world who do not think beyond the sense of the letter of the Word; but nothing of this kind is perceived in heaven when the"

I know that this will with difficulty be believed, but yet it is true. 314b. [2] That “lamb” in the Word signifies the good of innocence, and in reference to the Lord himself, “lamb” signifies his Divine human, can be seen from the following passages. In Isaiah: Behold, the Lord Jehovih cometh in strength. He shall feed his flock like a shepherd; he shall gather the lambs into his arm, and shall carry them in his bosom, and shall gently lead the sucklings (Isa. 40:10–11). This treats of the Lord’s coming; the “flock that he shall feed as a shepherd” signify those who are in the good of charity; and the “lambs that he shall gather into his arm” signify those who are in love to him. It is this love that, viewed in itself, is innocence; therefore all who are in it are in the heaven of innocence, which is the third heaven; and as this love is signified by lambs, it is also said, “He shall gently lead the sucklings.” “Sucklings” and “infants” in the Word mean those who are in innocence (see Heaven and Hell, n. 277, 280, 329–345). [3] In the same: The wolf shall sojourn with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid, the calf and the young lion and the fatling together, and a little boy shall lead them; and the heifer and the bear shall feed, their young ones shall lie down together; the suckling shall play on the hole of the adder, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the basilisk’s den (Isa. 11:6–8). These things are said of the Lord’s coming and of his kingdom, also of those therein who are in the good of innocence, that they shall have nothing to fear from the hells and the evils therefrom, because"

The Lord’s kingdom is here described by innocences of various kinds, and by their opposites from which they shall be protected; a “lamb” means innocence of the inmost degree, its opposite is the “wolf”; a “kid” means innocence of the second degree, the opposite of which is the “leopard”; a “calf” means innocence of the last degree, the opposite of which is the “young lion.” (That “lamb,” “ram,” or “sheep,” and “calf” signify three degrees of innocence, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 10132.) Innocence of the inmost degree is such as belongs to those who are in the third or inmost heaven, and its good is called celestial good; innocence of the second degree is such as belongs to those who are in the second or middle heaven, and its good is called spiritual good; and innocence of the last degree is such as belongs to those who are in the first or the last heaven, and its good is called spiritual-natural good. (That all who are in the heavens are in some good of innocence, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 4797.) Because the goods of innocence are described by the animals above named, it is said further “and a little boy shall lead them,” also, “the suckling shall play on the hole of the adder, and the weaned child shall put forth his hand on the basilisk’s den.” These degrees of innocence are signified also by “boy,” “suckling,” and “weaned child.” (That “boy” has this signification, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 430, 5236; that “suckling,” or infant of the first age, and “weaned child,” or infant of the second age, have these significations see n. 3183, 4563, 5608, 6740, 6745.) [4] Because a “lamb” signifies innocence, or those who are innocent, and a “wolf” those who are against innocence, it is said in like manner in another place in the same prophet: The wolf and the lamb shall feed together; they shall not do evil in the whole mountain of holiness (Isa. 65:25); “the mountain of holiness” is heaven, especially the inmost heaven. Therefore the Lord said to the seventy whom he sent forth: I send you forth as lambs in the midst of wolves (Luke 10:3)."

He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs; and afterwards, Feed my sheep (John 21:15–17). These things were said to Peter, because by “Peter” truth from good, or faith from charity was meant, and truth from good teaches; “to feed” meaning to teach. [6] In Ezekiel: Arabia and all the princes of Kedar, these were the merchants of thy hand, in lambs, rams, and goats (Ezek. 27:21). This is said of Tyre, by which those who are in the knowledges of truth and good are meant. “Arabia” and “the princes of Kedar,” who are “the merchants of her hand” signify those who are in truths and goods from knowledges; “merchants” signify those who communicate and teach these; “lambs, rams, and goats” signify three degrees of the good of innocence, the same as “lambs, rams, and calves.” (That these signify the three degrees of the good of innocence, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 10042, 10132.) [7] In like manner in Moses: He made him to ride on the high places of the earth, and fed him with the increase of the fields; he made him to suck honey out of the cliff, and oil out of the flint of the rock; butter of the herd and milk of the flock, with the fat of lambs, of the rams of Bashan, and of goats, with the fat of the kidneys of wheat; and thou drinkest the pure blood of the grape (Deut. 32:13–14).

[8] In Isaiah: The sword of Jehovah shall be filled with blood; it shall be made fat with fatness, with the blood of lambs and of he-goats, and with the fat of the kidneys of rams (Isa. 34:6). Here, too, “lambs, rams, and goats” signify the three degrees of the good of innocence (of which above); but here their destruction by the falsities of evil is treated of; for “sword” signifies falsity destroying truth and good; the “blood” with which it shall be filled signifies destruction. 314c. [9] Since a “lamb” signifies innocence, which, viewed in itself, is love to the Lord, a “lamb,” in the highest sense, signifies the Lord in respect to the Divine human, for in respect to this, the Lord was innocence itself; as may be seen in the following passages. In Isaiah: He endured persecution and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth; he is led as a lamb to the slaughter (Isa. 53:7).

(That “burnt offerings” signified all worship from the good of love to the Lord from the Lord, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 923, 6905, 8680, 8936, 10042.) On account of this representation there was also instituted: The supper of the passover of lambs or kids (Exod. 12:1–29); for “the feast of the passover” represented the glorification of the Lord’s human (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 10655). Because “infants” signified innocence, it was also commanded that: After birth, on the day of purification, they should sacrifice a lamb, a young pigeon, or a turtle dove; or, instead of a lamb, two young pigeons or two turtle doves (Lev. 12:6, 8); “young pigeons” and “turtle doves” signifying the like as “lambs,” namely, innocence. 315a. As if slain, signifies as yet acknowledged by few. This is evident from the signification of “slain,” as being, in reference to the Lord, that he has not been acknowledged; here that few have acknowledged his human to be Divine, for it is said “a lamb standing as if slain,” a “lamb” signifying the Lord in respect to the Divine human (as was shown just above, n. 314). The meaning here is similar to what was said of the Lord (chap. 1:18), “and I became dead,” which signifies that he was rejected (see above, n. 83). In the spiritual or internal sense, “slain” does not mean slain in respect to the body, but in respect to the soul; and man is slain in respect to the soul when he is no longer in any good of faith, for he then has no spiritual life, but death instead, which is called spiritual death. But this is not what the term “slain” signifies when applied to the Lord, since the Lord is life itself, and gives spiritual life to everyone; but it signifies either that he is rejected or that he is not acknowledged; for with those who do not acknowledge, and still"

The Lord himself, to be sure, and also his Divine, is acknowledged in the church, but in respect to the human as a mere man and not as God; thus it is that his Divine human is not acknowledged; this, therefore, is what is meant by “a lamb standing as if slain.” But that the Lord is God also as to the human, can be seen in Doctrine of the New Jerusalem (n. 280–310), and will be seen at the end of this work, where it will be plainly shown. [2] Those who think solely from the sense of the letter of the Word, and not at the same time from the doctrine of genuine truth, know no otherwise than that “slain” in the Word means slain in respect to the body; but that it means slain in respect to the soul will be seen from the passages to be quoted presently. For it is acknowledged that the Word in its inmost is spiritual, although in the sense of the letter it is natural; and to be slain spiritually is to perish in respect to the soul, as is the case with those who do not receive the life of heaven, which is called “life eternal,” and also simply “life,” and who thus in place of this have death, which is damnation. And because this is acknowledged, it follows that “to be slain” means in the Word to perish by falsities and evils. But spiritually the Lord is said “to be slain” when the truth from him is denied and the good from him is rejected; with these the Lord is also not acknowledged, for he who denies and rejects what is from him, denies and rejects him also, for the Lord is with man in his truths and goods. [3] But here his Divine human is treated of; that this is not acknowledged as yet, is known. I will state the reasons: one is, that the popish body has transferred to its own primate all Divine power that the Lord has, also that in respect to his human, and are unwilling to hear that it is Divine, since it is from his human. The other reason is, that those who are not of that body have made faith alone the sole means of salvation, and not the life of charity; and those who do this are unable to perceive the Lord’s human as differing from the human of another man; they therefore abide blindly in the doctrine of the trinity from the creed of Athanasius, and cannot be illuminated."

Prepare slaughter for his sons (Isa. 14:19–21). This is said of Babylon, which signifies the profanation of good and truth, and the consequent destruction of the church. It is compared to “the raiment of those that are slain, who are thrust through with the sword,” because “the raiment of those that are slain” signifies abominable falsity, defiling and destroying the things of the church; they are therefore said “to be thrust through with the sword,” because “sword” signifies falsity destroying truth. Therefore it is said, “thou hast destroyed thy land, thou hast slain thy people,” “land” means the church, and “people” those therein who are in truths; to “slay” these is to destroy by falsities. “Prepare slaughter for his sons” signifies that their falsities are to be destroyed, “his sons” meaning falsities. [5] In Jeremiah: The slain of Jehovah shall be at that day from the end of the earth unto the end of the earth (Jer. 25:33). “The slain of Jehovah from the end of the earth unto the end of the earth” signify those with whom all the truths of the church have been destroyed by falsities; “the slain of Jehovah” signifying those with whom they have been destroyed, and “from the end of the earth unto the end of the earth” signifying all things of the church.

Everyone that is found shall be thrust through; and everyone gathered together shall fall by the sword (Isa. 13:11, 15). This also is said of Babylon. That “everyone that is found shall be thrust through” signifies that they shall perish by evil; and that “everyone gathered together shall fall by the sword” signifies that they shall perish by falsity. [20] In Matthew: In the end of the age they shall deliver you up unto tribulation and shall slay you (Matt. 24:9). In John: They shall put you out of the synagogues; yea, the hour cometh that everyone who killeth you will think that he offereth sacred worship to God (John 16:2). This was said to the disciples; and by “disciples,” in the spiritual representative sense, are meant all truths and goods of the church; whence it is clear what is meant in that sense by “they shall kill them,” namely, that the truths and goods of the church shall then be destroyed. [21] In Mark: In the consummation of the age, brother shall deliver up brother to death, the father the children; children shall rise up against parents, and shall cause them to be put to death (Mark 13:12). The consummation of the age is the last time of the church, when falsities shall destroy truths and evils shall destroy goods. “Brother,” “father,” and “children,” do not mean here brother, father, and"

[22] In Luke: The man who planted a vineyard sent a servant that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard; but the husbandmen beat him, and sent him away empty. Again he sent another servant; and beating him also, they sent him away empty. Again he sent a third, and wounding him, they cast him out. Then said the lord of the vineyard, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son. But they said, This is the heir; come, let us kill him; and casting him out of the vineyard they killed him (Luke 20:10–16; Mark 12:2–9). This is said respecting the church instituted among the Jews, and it describes the perversion and falsification by traditions and by applications to self of every truth they had from the Word. All the particulars here contain a spiritual sense; for whatever the Lord spoke, he spoke also spiritually, because from the Divine. The “vineyard which the man planted” signifies the church that is in truths; the “servants whom he sent thrice,” mean the Word given them through Moses and the prophets; there is mention of three times, because “three” signifies what is full and complete; “their beating them, wounding them, and sending them away empty out of the vineyard” signifies that they falsified and perverted the truths contained in the Word; “to send away empty out of the vineyard” signifies that they deprived the Word of its goods and truths. “The beloved son” means the Lord in respect to Divine truth, who is therefore called also the Word; “they cast him out of the vineyard and killed him” signifies killing not only the Lord, but also all Divine truth from him (see also above, n. 83)."

Having seven horns, signifies who has omnipotence. This is evident from the signification of a “horn,” as being the power of truth against falsity, but in reference to the Lord, as being all power or omnipotence. The lamb was seen to have horns seven in number, because “seven” signifies all and it is predicated of what is holy (see above, n. 257). A “horn” and “horns” signify power, because the power of horned animals, as of oxen, rams, goats, and others, is in their horns. That “horn” or “horns” signify the power of truth against falsity, and in the highest sense, which treats of the Lord, signify omnipotence, and in a contrary sense the power of falsity against truth, is evident from many passages in the Word; and as it is thus made clear what is signified in the Word by “horns,” so often mentioned in Daniel, and also in Revelation; and as they are still employed in the coronation of kings, I will quote the passages here. [2] In Ezekiel: In that day I will make a horn to bud forth unto the house of Israel, and I will give thee the opening of the mouth in the midst of them; that they may know that I am Jehovah (Ezek. 29:21). “To make a horn to bud forth unto the house of Israel” signifies truth in abundance; “the house of Israel” is the church; because this"

[3] In the first book of Samuel: My horn hath exalted itself in Jehovah; my mouth is enlarged against mine enemies, because I am glad in thy salvation. He shall give strength unto his king,6 and shall exalt the horn of his anointed (1 Sam. 2:1, 10). This is a prophetical saying of Hannah. “My horn hath exalted itself in Jehovah” signifies that Divine truth filled her, and made her powerful against falsities; and because this is the meaning, it is said, “my mouth is enlarged against mine enemies”; “enlarging the mouth” is preaching truth with power, and “enemies” are the falsities that disperse Divine truth. “He shall give strength unto his king and shall exalt the horn of his anointed” signifies the Lord’s omnipotence from Divine good by Divine truth, for “strength” in the Word has reference to the power of good, and “horn” to the power of truth; and “the anointed of Jehovah” is the Lord in respect to the Divine human, which has omnipotence (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 3008–3009, 9954). [4] In David: Jehovah hath exalted the horn of his people, the praise for all his saints, for the sons of Israel, a people near unto him (Ps. 148:14). “He hath exalted the horn of his people” signifies that he hath filled with Divine truths; therefore it is said, praise for “his saints, for the sons of Israel, a people near unto him,” for those are called “saints” who are in Divine truths, since Divine truth is what is called holy (see above, n. 204). “Israel” is the church that is in truths, “sons of Israel” are truths, “a people” is also predicated of those who are in truths, and a people conjoined with the Lord by truths is said to be “near.”"

Here also “to exalt the horn” signifies to fill with Divine truth, and thereby to give power against falsities; therefore it is said, “Jehovah God of Hosts, thou art the splendor of their strength,” “splendor” in the Word is predicated also of the church, and of the doctrine of truth therein. [6] In the same: The good man is gracious and lendeth. His righteousness standeth forever; his horn shall be exalted with glory (Ps. 112:5, 9). That “horn” signifies Divine truth is clear from this, that it is said, “his righteousness standeth forever, and his horn shall be exalted with glory”; “righteousness” in the Word is predicated of good, and “horn” therefore of truth; for in every particular of the Word there is a marriage of good and truth; “splendor” also signifies Divine truth. [7] In Habakkuk: The brightness of Jehovah God shall be as the light; he hath horns coming out of his hand; and in them is the hiding of his strength (Hab. 3:4). Because “horns” signify Divine truth with power, it is said, “the brightness of Jehovah God shall be as the light,” and “in the horns is the hiding of his strength”; “the brightness of Jehovah” and “light” signify Divine truth; and “the hiding of his strength in the horns” signifies the omnipotence of Divine good through Divine truth, for all power of good is through truth, and in Divine truth lies concealed the omnipotence that is of Divine good. 316b.

My truth and my mercy shall be with him; and in my name shall his horn be exalted (Ps. 82:20–21, 24). “David” means the Lord in respect to Divine truth (see above, n. 205); and “his horn shall be exalted” means his Divine power, which he has from Divine good through Divine truth; therefore, it is said, “My truth and my mercy shall be with him”; “mercy” in the Word, in reference to Jehovah, or the Lord, signifies the Divine good of the Divine love. Because “David” means the Lord in respect to Divine truth proceeding from his Divine human, he is called “David, my servant,” “servant” meaning, in the Word, not a servant in the usual sense, but whatever serves, and it is predicated of truth because truth serves good for use, here for power. [9] In the same: I will make a horn to bud forth unto David; I will set in order a lamp for mine anointed (Ps. 132:17). Here by “David,” and also by “anointed” the Lord in respect to Divine truth is meant, and “making his horn to bud forth” signifies the multiplication of Divine truth in the heavens and on earth by him; therefore it is also said, “I will set in order a lamp for mine anointed,” which has a like meaning. That the Lord in respect to Divine truth proceeding from his Divine good, is called a “lamp” see above (n. 62).

This is a prophecy of Zechariah respecting the Lord and his coming. “A horn of salvation in the house of David” signifies omnipotence to save by Divine truth from Divine good, “horn” is that omnipotence; “the house of David” is the Lord’s church; “the enemies from which he should save” are the falsities of evil, for these are the enemies from which the Lord saves those who receive him; it is known that there were no other enemies from which the Lord saved those who are here meant by his people. [12] In Micah: Rise and thresh, O daughter of Zion, for I will make thy horn iron, and I will make thy hoofs brass, that thou mayest beat in pieces many peoples (Micah 4:13). “Rise and thresh, O daughter of Zion” signifies the dispersion of evil with those who are of the church, “to thresh” is to disperse, and “daughter of Zion” is the church that is in the affection of good; “I will make thy horn iron” signifies Divine truth mighty and powerful; “I will make thy hoofs brass” has a like meaning, “hoofs” meaning truths in ultimates; “that thou mayest beat in pieces many peoples” signifies that thou mayest scatter falsities, for “peoples” are predicated of truths, and in a contrary sense, of falsities.

He showed me four smiths, and he said, These horns that have scattered Judah, so that no man lifteth up his head; these have come to terrify them, to cast down the horns of the nations that lift up the horn against the land of Judah to scatter it (Zech. 1:18–21). This describes the vastation of the church, and its subsequent restoration. “Judah,” “Israel,” and “Jerusalem” signify the church and its doctrine; “the horns that scattered them” signify the falsities of evil that have vastated the church; “smiths” signify the like as iron, namely, truth in ultimates, which is mighty and powerful, thus the like as the “horn of iron”; therefore it is said of them, “these have come to cast down the horns of the nations that lift up the horn against the land of Judah,” “the horns of the nations” are the falsities of evil that have vastated the church, and that are to be dispersed that it may be restored. [14] In Lamentations: The Lord hath thrown in his fury the strongholds of the daughter of Judah; he hath cast them down to the earth; he hath profaned the kingdom and the princes thereof; he hath cut off in the glowing of his anger every horn of Israel (Lam. 2:2–3). Here the total vastation of the church is treated of. The last time when it was laid waste is signified by the glowing of the Lord’s anger; and its total vastation is described by “He hath thrown down the strongholds of the daughter of Judah, he hath cast them down to the earth. He hath profaned the kingdom and the princes thereof”; “the daughter of Judah” is the church; “her strongholds” are truths from good; “the kingdom and princes” are its truths of doctrine; whence it is clear what is signified by “He hath cut off every horn of Israel,” namely, the cutting off of all the power of truth in the church to resist the falsities of evil. 316c.

As to the ten horns, they are ten kings, and it shall humble three kings (Dan. 7:3, 7–8, 21, 23, 25). Here evidently “horns” means the falsities that destroy the truths of the church, or the power of falsities against truths; “the beast coming up out of the sea” signifies the love of self out of which spring all evils; here the love of ruling over heaven and earth, to which things holy serve as means; it is such a love that is meant by “Babylon” in Revelation. This beast was seen “coming up out of the sea,” because the “sea” signifies the natural man separated from the spiritual; for the natural man is then of such a character that he desires nothing so much as to have dominion over all, and to confirm that dominion by the sense of the letter of the Word. “The ten horns” signify falsities of every kind, for “ten” means all; therefore it is further said, that “the ten horns are ten kings,” for “kings” signify truths, and in a contrary sense, as here, falsities. “The little horn that came up among them, before which three of the former horns were plucked up by the roots” signifies the complete perversion of the Word by the application of the sense of its letter to confirm the love of dominion. This horn is called “little,” because it does not appear that the Word is perverted; and what does not appear before the sight of man’s spirit, or before his understanding, is regarded either as nothing, or as little. In the spiritual world such is the appearance of things that are apprehended by a few only. “The three horns that were plucked up by the roots before it” signify the truths of the Word there that have been thus destroyed by falsifications; these truths are also signified by the “three kings” that were humbled by the horn, “three” not meaning three, but what is full, thus that truths were completely destroyed. As that “horn” signifies the perversion of the Word in respect to the sense of its letter, and as this sense appears before the eyes of men as if it were to be understood thus and not otherwise, and therefore not to be gainsaid by anyone, it is said of this horn, “that in it there were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things,” “eyes” signify understanding, and “eyes like the eyes of a man” an understanding as if of truth, and"

It pushed westward, northward, and southward. Then, behold, a he- goat of the goats came from the west over the faces of the whole earth; he had a conspicuous horn between his eyes. He ran upon the ram in the wrath of his strength, and he broke his two horns, and he cast him down to the ground and trampled upon him. But the great horn of the he-goat was broken; and in place of it there came up four toward the four winds of the heavens. Presently out of one of them came forth a little horn, which grew exceedingly towards the south, and towards the east, and towards beauty. And it grew even to the host of the heavens; and it cast down some of the host to the earth, and trampled upon them. Yea, even to the prince of the host it magnified itself, and the dwelling place of his sanctuary was cast down, because it cast down truth to the earth (Dan. 8:2–12, 21, 25). This describes a second thing that lays waste the church, namely, faith alone. The “ram” signifies the good of charity and faith therefrom, and the “he-goat” faith separate from charity, or faith alone, or, what is the same, those who are in these; their “horns” signify truths from good and falsities from evil, combating; truths from good are meant by the horns of the ram, and falsities from evil by the horns of the he-goat. That the “ram had two high horns, one higher than the other, and the higher came up last” signifies the truth of faith from the good of charity; and this was seen according to the influx of good and truth with man and spirit; for all good is received behind, and all truth in front, as the cerebellum is formed to receive the good, which is of the will, and the"

That this horn “grew exceedingly towards the south, and towards the east, and towards beauty, and grew even to the host of the heavens, and cast down some of the host to the earth, and trampled upon them” signifies that it destroyed all the truths and goods of the church; “the south” meaning where truth is in the light, “the east” and “beauty” where good is in clearness through truth, “the host of the heavens” all truths and goods of heaven and the church; “to cast down the host to the earth, and to trample upon them” signifies to destroy utterly; that “even to the prince of the host it magnified itself,” and that “the dwelling place of his sanctuary was cast down” signifies the denial of the Lord’s Divine human, and the consequent vastation of the church; “the prince of the host” is the Lord in respect to the Divine human, because from that proceed all the truths and goods that constitute the church; “the dwelling place of the sanctuary” is the church where these are; this plainly means the truths destroyed by falsities, for it is said, “it cast down truth to"

These things have been seen by me also, and at the same time by those standing by, who were thereby confirmed that such things are meant in Daniel; and also that like things are meant by “the sheep on the right hand, and the goats on the left” (Matt. 25:32 to the end), namely, by “sheep” those who are in the good of charity, and by “goats” those who are in faith alone. From these quotations from Daniel it can be seen in some measure what is signified in Revelation by: The dragon that was seen having ten horns (Rev. 12:3); The beast that was seen coming up out of the sea, which also had ten horns (Rev. 13:1). The woman that was seen sitting upon a scarlet-colored beast, that had seven heads and ten horns; respecting which the angel said, The ten horns that thou sawest are ten kings (Rev. 17:3, 7, 12); but these things will be explained hereafter. 316d. [17] That the power of falsity against truth is signified by “horn” or “horns” is evident also from the following passages. In Jeremiah: The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken (Jer. 48:25). “Moab” signifies those who are in spurious goods, and in falsified truths therefrom, which in themselves are falsities. The destruction of these falsities is signified by “The horn of Moab is cut off,” and the destruction of these evils by “his arm is broken.”"

[19] In Ezekiel: Ye thrust with side and with shoulder, and push all the sick sheep with your horns till ye have scattered them abroad (Ezek. 34:21). “To thrust with side and with shoulder” is with all strength and endeavor; to “push the sick sheep with horns till ye have scattered them abroad” signifies to destroy by falsities the well-disposed, who are not yet in truths from good, and yet desire to be. [20] In Amos: In the day that I shall visit the transgressions of Israel upon him, I will visit upon the altars of Bethel, that the horns of the altar may be cut off, and fall to the earth (Amos 3:14). “The altars of Bethel” signify worship from evil, and “the horns of the altar” signify the falsities of that evil; and that these are to be destroyed is signified by “the horns shall be cut off and fall to the earth.” [21] In the same: They who are glad over a thing of nought; who say, Have we not taken to us horns by our own strength?

From this signification of horns, which was known to the ancients, it was customary to make horns budding forth and fragrant; from this came the word “cornucopia.” 317. And seven eyes, signifies and who has omniscience. This is evident from the signification of “seven eyes” as being, in reference to the Lord, omniscience; for as “eyes” in reference to man signify the understanding, so in reference to the Lord they signify omniscience. That “eyes” in reference to man signify the understanding, and in reference to the Lord providence, as also Divine wisdom and intelligence, which is omniscience, see above (n. 152). “Seven eyes” are mentioned, because “seven” signifies all things, and is predicated of what is holy (as above). 318. Which are the seven spirits of God, sent forth into all the earth, signifies that all wisdom and intelligence in heaven and in the church are therefrom. This is evident from the signification of “the seven spirits of God,” as being Divine truth proceeding from the Lord (of which above, n. 183); and as they signify Divine truth proceeding from the Lord, they also signify the Divine wisdom or omniscience. It is evident also from the signification of “sent forth into all the earth,” as being that this is the source of all wisdom and intelligence in heaven and in the church. “To be sent forth” signifies to be communicated, and “all the earth” signifies the church both in the heavens and on earth (see above, n. 304). Thence is clear why it is said that “the seven eyes of the lamb were the seven spirits of God, sent forth into all the earth,” for “seven eyes” signify the omniscience that the Lord has from Divine good through Divine truth. From this are all wisdom and intelligence, because man cannot from himself understand truth and relish good, but only from the Lord; and all wisdom and intelligence are of truth from good. Unless wisdom and intelligence be formed from it, they are not wisdom and intelligence, but folly and insanity, which appear before the ignorant and the evil like wisdom and intelligence, because of their being able to speak and reason from the memory."

From this it can be seen that unless man is elevated by the Lord from his selfhood, which is done when he receives Divine truth not only in the memory but also in the life, it is utterly impossible for him to be wise and intelligent. But this elevation by the Lord from the selfhood [a proprio] is not apparent to man, nor is it perceived by him while he is in the world, but it first becomes apparent when he comes into his spirit, and this takes place when his spirit has been separated from his material body; but even then it is perceived only by those who come into heaven. It is said wisdom and intelligence, because wisdom is of truth from good, for man then relishes good in truth; but intelligence is of truth through which good comes, for then man has not yet a relish for good in truth, but is affected by truth because it is truth. Those who are in the Lord’s celestial kingdom are in wisdom, because they are in truths from good; but those who are in the Lord’s spiritual kingdom are in intelligence, because they are in truths through which good comes.

The third or inmost heaven is conjoined with the second or middle by intermediate angels, who are called celestial-spiritual and spiritual- celestial angels; these intermediate angels, together with the angels of the third or inmost heaven, constitute the higher heavens; while the remainder of those in the second or middle heaven, together with those who are in the first or outmost heaven, constitute the lower heavens. The “four animals” signify specifically the third or inmost heaven, and the “four and twenty elders” the second or middle heaven that is in conjunction with the third or inmost; thus together they signify the higher heavens.

Such things are signified by musical instruments because of their sounds, for sound corresponds to the affections; moreover in heaven affections are perceived by sounds; and because there are various affections, and various sounds are produced by musical instruments, therefore these instruments, by correspondence and consequent agreement, signify affections. In general, stringed instruments signify such things as belong to the affections of truth, and wind instruments such as belong to the affections of good; or, what is the same, some instruments belong to the spiritual class, and some to the celestial class.

I will mention only, what is a matter of general observation, that discrete sounds excite the affections of truth, that is, those are affected by them who are in the affections of truth; while continuous sounds excite the affections of good, that is, those are affected by them who are in the affections of good. Whether you say the affections of truth or things spiritual, it is the same, or whether you say the affections of good or things celestial, it is the same. (But these things can be better comprehended from what has been related from experience respecting sounds and their correspondence with affections, in Heaven and Hell, n. 241.) 323b. From this it can now be seen why in the Word, and especially in David, so many kinds of musical instruments are mentioned, as psalteries, harps, flutes, cymbals, timbrels, horns, organs, and others, namely, that it is because of their correspondence with the affections, and at the same time with articulations that are expressions containing things, and flowing from them. [2] That harps especially signify the affections of truth because they excite such affections, consequently that they also signify confession made from spiritual truths with a cheerful heart, can be seen from the following passages. In Isaiah: The new wine shall mourn, the vine shall languish, all the glad of heart shall sigh. The joy of timbrels shall cease, the noise of the merry shall leave off; the joy of the harp shall cease. They shall not drink wine with a song (Isa. 24:7–9). This treats of the vastation of the spiritual church, that is, of the good and truth thereof. Spiritual good, which is about to cease, is signified by “the new wine shall mourn,” and “the joy of timbrels shall cease”; and that its truth is about to cease is signified by “the vine shall languish,” and “the joy of the harp shall cease”; for “new wine” signifies spiritual good, and its joy is signified by the"

It is added, “they shall not drink wine with a song,” because “song” signifies the testification of gladness from the affection of truth, and “wine” signifies truth.

Its vastation is described by these words; the vastation in respect to the knowledges of good by “I will cause the noise of thy songs to cease”; and the vastation in respect to the knowledges of truth by “the voice of harps shall be no more heard”; desolation of all truth by “I will give thee to the parchedness of the cliff”; “cliff” signifying truth, and its “parchedness” desolation.

Lift up the psalm and strike the timbrel, the pleasant harp, with the psaltery. Blow the cornet at the new moon (Ps. 81:1–3). It is good to confess unto Jehovah, and to sing psalms unto thy name, O most high; with an instrument of ten strings, and with the psaltery; and with resounding music on the harp (Ps. 92:1–3).

This then took place because with the sons of Israel all things were representative and thus significative; it is otherwise at this day. From the passages here quoted it can be seen what the “harp” signifies, also in other places (as Isa. 30:31, 32; Ps. 49:3, 4; 137:1, 2; 1 Sam. 10:5; Rev. 14:2; 18:22; Job 30:31). [13] As most things in the Word have also a contrary meaning, so do musical instruments, in which sense they signify varieties of gladness and joy that spring from the affections of falsity and evil; thus the “harp” signifies the confession of falsity and the consequent exultation over the destruction of truth. As in Isaiah: At the end of seventy years the song of Tyre shall be even as the song of a harlot; take a harp, walk in the city, thou harlot delivered over to forgetfulness; play elegantly, multiply the song (Isa. 23:15–16). “Tyre” signifies the church in respect to the knowledges of spiritual truth and good (as was said above), here the church in which these are falsified; “harlot” signifies the falsification of truth (see above, n. 141); and “to take a harp, walk in the city,” “play elegantly, and multiply the song” signifies the exultation and boasting of falsity over the destruction of truth. [14] In the same: Woe to them that rise early in the morning that they may follow strong drink; to them that tarry until twilight till the wine inflame them. And the harp and the psaltery and the timbrel and the pipe and wine are at their feasts; but they do not look upon the work of Jehovah, and they see not the working of his hands (Isa. 5:11–12). Here “harp,” “psaltery,” “timbrel,” “pipe,” and also “wine,” have the contrary meaning, in which they signify exultation and boastings from the falsities of evil. Such is evidently the meaning,"

And golden bowls full of incense, signifies confession from spiritual goods. This is evident from the signification of “golden bowls,” which are also called “censers,” and “incense pans,” as being truths from good; for “bowls,” like all containing vessels, signify truths, and “gold,” of which they were made, signifies good, therefore “golden bowls” are truths from good. (That “vessels” signify truths, because truths serve good as recipient and containing vessels, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 3068, 3079, 3316, 3318; also “the vessels of the altars,” “of burnt offering,” and “of incense,” n. 9723, 9724; and that “gold” signifies good, above, n. 242a, d, e.) It is evident also from the signification of “incense,” as being those things of worship that are done from spiritual good, or from the good of charity, and are therefore gratefully perceived. Such things are signified by “incense,” because all things that are instituted in the Israelitish nation were representative of celestial and spiritual things; so also were the things relating to odor; things of pleasant odor represented pleasant perception, but those of unpleasant odor unpleasant perception. On this account incense was made of fragrant spices, myrrh, onycha, galbanum, and frankincense. Moreover, there is a correspondence between odor and perception, as can be seen from this, that in the spiritual world, where all things perceived by the senses correspond, the perception of good and truth is made sensible as fragrance from pleasant odors, and vice versa (respecting this see what is shown from experience, Arcana Coelestia, n. 1514, 1517–1519, 1631, 4626, 4628, 4630, 4631, 5711–5717). From this it is that also in the common language of men, to smell means to perceive; for such expressions, like many others, have come into human discourse from correspondence; for the spirit of man is actually in the spiritual world, although man is not conscious of it. Moreover, the faculty of perception that man has, is what produces in his body the sense of smell, and this too from correspondence. But this is an arcanum that can with difficulty be credited, because it has been hitherto unknown. It is to be noted that this sweet smell or fragrance is produced by the good of love and charity, but by means of truth, not by good itself"

[2] “Incense” signifies those things of worship that are done from spiritual good, because spiritual good has its origin and existence from celestial good, which good is the good of love to the Lord from the Lord, and is therefore the very good of heaven, for that good is immediately from the Lord, and the Lord is with angels in that good as in what is his. This is even so far true that whether you say that the Lord is in them and they in the Lord, or that the Lord is with them in that good and they are in the Lord when in that good, it is the same. Spiritual good, which has its origin and existence from celestial good, is the good of charity towards the neighbor; worship from this good is what is signified by “incense.” As all worship of the Lord comes from good, although through truths, and as there are two universal goods that make the heavens and distinguish them into two kingdoms, namely, celestial good, which is the good of love to the Lord, and spiritual good, which is the good of charity towards the neighbor, therefore with the sons of Israel there were two altars, one for burnt offerings, the other for incense offerings; the altar of burnt offering signifying worship from the good of celestial love, and the altar of incense worship from the good of spiritual love; thence it is clear what was represented by “incense.” 324b. [3] That this is so can be seen from passages in the Word where the two are mentioned.

And Aaron shall burn thereon incense of spices every morning, when dressing the lamps he shall burn it, and in making the lamps to ascend between the evenings he shall burn it, a perpetual incense before Jehovah in your generations. Ye shall make no strange incense to ascend thereon, nor burnt sacrifice, nor meal offering, nor drink offering (Exod. 30:1–10)."

It is there shown that the things that were in the tent without the veil, namely, the lamp stand, the altar of incense, and the table for the bread, signified such things as are of the spiritual kingdom, all of which have reference to spiritual good and its truth. The “table, upon which was the bread of faces” signified the reception of celestial good in spiritual good (see n. 9527); the “lampstand” with the “lamps” signified the spiritual itself of that kingdom (n. 9548, 9551, 9556, 9561, 9572, 9783); the “altar of incense” signified worship from spiritual good; and because worship from spiritual good was signified by burning incense upon that altar, and the spiritual itself by the “lampstand,” it was commanded that Aaron should burn incense upon it every morning and evening, when he dressed the lamps. (But these things are more fully explained in Arcana Coelestia, n. 10176–10213, where these particulars are treated of.) [4] And because spiritual good has its origin and existence from celestial good (as was said above), not only was that altar placed near the veil that was over the ark, but it was also commanded that when Aaron should make atonement for himself and for his house, he should bring the incense within the veil, which signified the influx, communication, and conjunction of celestial good and spiritual good. Of this it is written in Moses: When Aaron shall make an atonement for himself and for his house he shall kill the bullock of the sin offering; and he shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire from off the altar before Jehovah, and his hands full of the incense of spices, and he shall bring it within the veil, that he may put the incense upon the fire before Jehovah; and the"

That “he should take fire from off the altar of burnt offering,” and “should put incense upon the fire” signified that spiritual good, which is the good of charity, has existence and proceeds from celestial good, which is the good of love to the Lord (that the “fire of the altar” signified that good, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 4489, 6314, 6832, 9714, and elsewhere). This is why the fire for burning incense was not taken from anywhere else than from the altar of burnt offering. When Aaron made atonement for himself and his house he was to burn the incense within the veil because Aaron as chief priest represented the Lord in respect to the good of love, and by his functions he represented the things that proceed from that good, all of which relate to spiritual good; spiritual good, unless it is from celestial good, is not good; except for this Aaron’s function could not have been from the Divine, or could not have represented anything of the Divine; and this is why Aaron was threatened with death unless he did as he was commanded. [5] For the same reason also Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, were consumed by fire from heaven because they burnt incense from other fire than the fire of the altar of burnt offering, which is offering worship from a love other than love to the Lord; respecting which it is thus written in Moses: Nadab and Abihu, sons of Aaron, took each of them his censer and put strange fire therein, and laid incense thereon. Therefore fire went out from before Jehovah and devoured them, and they died, afterwards they were carried without the camp (Lev. 10:1–5). “They were carried without the camp” signified that their worship was not from heaven, because not from love to the Lord; for “the camp of the sons of Israel” represented heaven and the church (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 4236, 10038).

But afterwards it was commanded: That they should gather up the censers, and scatter the fire hitherwards; and of the censers, which were of brass, they should make broad plates, a covering to the altar, because they had been sanctified (Num. 16:37–38). The censers had been sanctified by the “fire of the altar,” which signified Divine celestial love. [7] Because spiritual good, which is the good of charity towards the neighbor, derives its essence and soul from celestial good, which is the good of love to the Lord, therefore also “frankincense,” which signifies spiritual good, was put upon the “bread of faces,” which signified celestial good; as can be seen from these words in Moses: And frankincense shall be put upon the bread of faces which is upon the table in the tent of meeting, that the bread may be for a memorial (Lev. 24:7). “That the bread may be for a memorial” signifies that the Lord may receive and give heed; for all worship of the Lord which is truly worship comes from celestial good through spiritual good; for spiritual good, which is charity towards the neighbor, is an effect of celestial good, for charity towards the neighbor is the performance of uses, and living a moral life from a heavenly origin (respecting which see Heaven and Hell, n. 390, 484, 529, 530–535; and Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, n. 84–107), this, therefore, is"

That these had such a signification was still known to many in the east, therefore they were also called “sons of the east,” by whom in the Word those who are in the knowledges of truth and good are meant (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 3249, 3762), for the knowledge of correspondences had remained among them; therefore that they might testify their joy of heart they offered such things as signified every good from first to last; and this is what was predicted in Isaiah, that they “were to come from Sheba, and bring gold and frankincense, and proclaim the praises of Jehovah” (of which just above). [11] In Malachi: From the rising of the sun even unto its going down my name shall be great among the nations; and in every place incense shall be offered unto my name, and a clean meal offering (Mal. 1:11). “From the rising of the sun even unto its going down my name shall be great among the nations” signifies that the church and worship of the Lord shall be everywhere with those who are in good; “from the rising of the sun to its going down” signifying every place where there is good; “my name shall be great” signifying the acknowledgment and worship of the Lord; and “nations” signifying those who are in good; “incense shall be offered unto my name, and a clean meal offering” signifies the worship of the Lord from spiritual good, which is the good of charity towards the neighbor, and from celestial good, which is the good of love to the Lord; worship from spiritual good is signified by “incense offering,” and from celestial good by “meal offering.” (That a “meal offering” signifies that good, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 4581, 10079, 10137.)"

Let my prayers be accepted as incense before thee; the lifting up of my hands as the evening meal offering (Ps. 141:1–2). And in Isaiah: Thou hast brought to me the small cattle of thy burnt offerings, and thou hast not honored me with thy sacrifices. I have not made thee to serve by a meal offering, nor wearied thee by frankincense (Isa. 43:23). As all worship of the Lord comes from spiritual good that is from celestial good, therefore the two, “meal offering” and “frankincense” are mentioned separately in the letter, yet in the internal or spiritual sense they are to be understood conjointly, but the one from the other. [13] So in Jeremiah: They shall come from the cities of Judah, and from the circuits of Jerusalem, bringing burnt offering and sacrifice, and meal offering and frankincense (Jer. 17:26). Here “Judah” and “Jerusalem” do not mean Judah and Jerusalem, but the Lord’s church, which is in the good of love and in the doctrine of charity therefrom; worship from these is signified by “burnt offering and sacrifice,” also by “meal offering and frankincense.” [14] Because “meal offering” signified the good of celestial love, and “frankincense” the good of spiritual love, upon the meal offering of fine flour were put oil and frankincense, as appears in Moses: When a soul would offer the offering of a meal offering unto Jehovah, fine flour shall be his offering, upon which he shall pour oil, and shall put upon it frankincense; and the priest shall take out of it his"

This meal offering was instituted because “fine flour” signifies genuine truth (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 9995); and since this truth is from good, namely, from celestial good, and from consequent spiritual good, “oil and frankincense” were put upon it; “oil” signifying the good of celestial love, and “frankincense” the good of spiritual love; in the internal sense, the one from the other. There were also other kinds of meal offerings that were prepared with oil that had a like signification. [15] In Ezekiel: Thou hast taken the garments of thy embroidery, and hast covered the images of the male, with which thou didst commit whoredom; and didst set my oil and my incense before them (Ezek. 16:18–19). This is said of Jerusalem, which signifies the church in respect to doctrine, here doctrine altogether perverted. The “images of the male,” which “she covered with the garments of her embroidery, and with which she committed whoredom” signify the falsities that they made, by perverse interpretations, to appear as truths, thus they signify falsified truths, “garments of embroidery” meaning the knowledges of truth from the Word, and “to commit whoredom” meaning to falsify; to set my oil and my incense before them” signifies to adulterate both the good of celestial love and the good of spiritual love; and these are adulterated when the Word is applied to the loves of self and of the world. [16] In Moses: They shall teach Jacob thy judgments, and Israel thy law; they shall put incense in thy nostrils, and a burnt offering upon thine altar (Deut. 33:10).

[17] In David: I will go into thy house with burnt offerings; I will pay my vows unto thee. I will offer unto thee burnt offerings of fatlings, rams with incense (Ps. 66:13, 15). “To offer burnt offerings of fatlings” signifies worship from the good of celestial love; “to offer rams with incense” signifies worship from the good of spiritual love; “incense” and “ram” signifying that good. [18] In Revelation: Another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given unto him much incense, that he might offer it with the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar that was before the throne. And the smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, went up out of the angel’s hand before God. Afterwards the angel took the censer and filled it with the fire of the altar and cast it into the earth (Rev. 8:3–5). What this means will be told in the explanation of these words in what follows; here it need merely be said that “incense” signifies worship from spiritual good, which is the good of charity toward the neighbor. Such worship is signified also by “the prayers of the saints”; it is therefore said “that there was given unto him much incense, that he might offer it with prayers of the saints”; and then that “the smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, went up before God.” That the “prayers of the saints” signify worship from spiritual good will be seen in the next paragraph, so also what is meant by worship from spiritual good, or from the good of charity."

(That the ancients held Divine worship in gardens and groves in accordance with the significations of the trees therein, but that this was forbidden among the Israelitish nation, lest they should frame to themselves a worship from selfhood, see n. 2722, 4552.) 324e.

[24] Moreover, “burning incense” signifies those things of worship that are perceived as grateful, and “incense” signifies spiritual good, because all things that were instituted in the Israelitish nation were representative of things celestial and spiritual; for the church with them was not as the church at this day, which is internal, but it was external; and the externals represented and thus signified the internal things of the church, such as were disclosed by the Lord in the Word of the New Testament; for this reason their church was called a representative church. The externals of that church consisted of such things in the world of nature as corresponded to the affections of good and truth in the spiritual world; consequently when those who were of that church were in externals in respect to worship, those who were in the spiritual world, that is, in heaven, were in the internals, and conjoined themselves with those who were in externals; it was in this way that heaven at that time made one with the men on the earth.

And the incense that thou makest ye shall not make in its quality for yourselves; it shall be unto thee holy to Jehovah. The man who shall make like unto it to smell thereof shall be cut off from his peoples (Exod. 30:34–38). (But what these particulars signify, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 10289–10310, where they are explained consecutively.) Here it may be said merely that frankincense was the primary ingredient, and the other three were added for the sake of their odor; therefore it is said of the frankincense, that “a like quantity with a like quantity it shall be,” or as much of one as of the other; in like manner as with the anointing oil, in which the oil of the olive was the primary ingredient, and the other things in it were significative"

And in Hosea: His branches shall spread, and he shall be as the honor of the olive, and his odor as that of Lebanon (Hos. 14:6). This is said of Israel; “the honor of the olive” signifies celestial good, and “the odor of Lebanon” spiritual good, from its gratefulness. (That “honor” is predicated of celestial good, see above, n. 288b; that the “olive” also signifies that good, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 9277, 10261; that “odor” signifies what is perceived as grateful according to the quality of love and faith, n. 1514–1519, 3577, 4624–4634, 4748, 5621, 10292; that the “odor of rest” signifies the perceptive of peace, n. 925, 10054; what this is see Heaven and Hell, n. 284–290.) 325a.

But in the internal sense of the Word by “saints” are not meant saints [holy men], but things holy, for the term “saints” involves persons, and in the internal sense everything of person is put off, for things solely make that sense (see above, n. 270); and that the angels, because they are spiritual, think abstractly from persons (see also above, n. 99, 100). This is what distinguishes the internal sense of the Word from its external sense, which is the sense of the letter; and as “saints” thus mean things holy, and “holy” in the Word means the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord, and making his spiritual kingdom (as may be seen above, n. 204), so by “saints” things spiritual are meant, and by the “prayers of the saints” worship from spiritual good. That worship from that good is meant by the “prayers of the saints” is evident from this, that it is said “they had golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints”; and “incense” signifies all things of worship that are from spiritual good (as was shown in the preceding paragraph); from which it follows that the “prayers of the saints” has a like signification.

Guard the door of my lips; let not my heart decline to evil, to do evil deeds in wickedness with the men who work iniquity; for still my prayers are in their evils (Ps. 141:1–5). Here also “prayers” are called “incense,” and “the lifting up of the hands” is called a “meal offering”; and this because “prayers” and “incense” have a similar signification, also “lifting up of the hands” and “meal offering.” “Incense” signifies spiritual good, which is the good of charity towards the neighbor; and “meal offering” signifies celestial good, which is the good of love to the Lord; thus both signifying worship.

And the smoke of the incense with the prayers of the saints went up before God (Rev. 8:3–4). As “prayers” and “incense” have here similar significance, namely, worship from spiritual good, it is said, “there was given unto him much incense, that he might offer it with the prayers of the saints”; likewise that “the smoke of the incense went up with the prayers of the saints unto God.” What is meant by worship from spiritual good shall first be explained, and afterwards that prayers signify such worship. Worship does not consist in prayers and in external devotion, but in a life of charity; prayers are only its externals, for they proceed from the man through his mouth, consequently men’s prayers are such as they themselves are in respect to life. It matters not that a man bears himself humbly, that he kneels and sighs when he prays; for these are externals, and unless externals proceed from internals they are only gestures and sounds without life. In each thing that a man utters there is affection, and every man, spirit, and angel is his own affection, for their affection is their life; it is the affection itself that speaks, and not the man without it; therefore such as the affection is such is the praying. Spiritual affection is what is called charity towards the neighbor; to be in that affection is true worship; praying is what proceeds. From this it can be seen that the essential of worship is the life of charity, and that its instrumental is gesture and praying; or that the primary of worship is a life of charity, and its secondary is praying. From this it is clear that those who place all Divine worship in oral piety, and not in practical piety, err greatly."

      "text": "APOCALYPSE EXPLAINED 767 [4] Practical piety is to act in every work and in every duty from sincerity and right, and from justice and equity, and this because it is commanded by the Lord in the Word; for thus man in his every work looks to heaven and to the Lord, and thus is conjoined with him. But to act sincerely and rightly, justly and equitably, solely from fear of the law, of the loss of fame or of honor and gain, and to think nothing of the Divine law, of the commandments of the Word, and of the Lord, and yet to pray devoutly in the churches, is external piety; however holy this may appear, it is not piety, but it is either hypocrisy, or something put on derived from habit, or a kind of persuasion from a false belief that Divine worship consists merely in this; for such a man does not look to heaven and to the Lord with the heart, but only with the eyes; the heart looking to self and to the world, and the mouth speaking from the habit of the body only and its memory; by this man is conjoined to the world and not to heaven, and to self and not to the Lord. From this it can be seen what piety is, and what Divine worship is, and that practical piety is worship itself. On this see also what is said in Heaven and Hell (n. 222, 224, 358–360, 528–530); and in Doctrine of the New Jerusalem (n. 123–129), where also are these words: Piety is to think and speak piously; to spend much time in prayer; to bear oneself humbly at such times; to frequent churches, and listen devoutly to discourses there; to observe the sacrament of the Supper frequently every year, and likewise the other services of worship according to the appointments of the church. But a life of charity is to will well and do well to the neighbor; to act in every work from justice and equity, from good and truth, and also in every duty; in a word, the life of charity consists in performing uses. Divine worship consists primarily in such a life, and secondarily in a life of piety; he, therefore, who separates the one from the other, that is, who lives a life of piety and not at the same time a life of charity, does not worship God. For a life of piety is valuable so far as a life of charity is joined with it; for the life of charity is the primary thing, and such as this is, such is the life of piety (n. 124, 128). 325b. [5] That the Lord insinuates heaven into man’s practical piety, but not into oral or external piety separate therefrom, has been testified to me by much experience. For I have seen many who placed all worship in oral and outward piety, while in their"

According to their belief, therefore, they were raised up into heaven; but when the angels perceived that they worshiped God with the mouth only, and not with the heart, and that their external piety did not proceed from practical piety, which is of the life, they cast them down; afterwards these became associated with those who were in a life like their own, and were there deprived of their piety and sanctity, since these were interiorly defiled by evils of life. From this also it was made clear, that Divine worship consists primarily in a life of charity and secondarily in external piety. [6] As Divine worship itself consists primarily in the life, and not in prayers, the Lord said that in praying there should not be much speaking and repetition, in the following words: In praying, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do; for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking. Do not make yourselves, therefore, like them (Matt. 6:7–8). Now as Divine worship itself consists primarily in a life of charity, and secondarily in prayers, by “prayers,” in the spiritual sense of the Word, worship from spiritual good, that is, from the life of charity, is meant, for that which is primary is what is meant in the spiritual sense, while the sense of the letter consists of things secondary, which are effects, and which correspond. [7] Prayers are mentioned, moreover, in many passages of the Word; but as prayers proceed from the heart, and a man’s heart is such as is his life of love and charity, so “prayers,” in the spiritual sense, mean that life and worship from it, as in the following. In Luke:"

[8] In Mark: Jesus said, All things that ye ask for, praying, believe that ye are to receive, and then it shall be done for you. But when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have aught against any (Mark 11:24–25). Here, also, in the spiritual sense, by “praying,” “asking for,” and “supplicating,” a life of love and charity is meant; for to those who are in a life of love and charity it is given from the Lord what they are to ask; therefore they ask nothing but what is good, and that is done for them; and as faith also is from the Lord, it is said, “believe that ye are to receive”; and as prayers proceed from a life of charity, and are according to it, in order that it may be done according to the prayers, it is said, “When ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have aught against any.” [9] “When ye stand praying” signifies when in Divine worship, as is clear also from this, that the like as is here said of those who pray is said also of those who offer a gift upon the altar, in Matthew: If thou offer a gift upon the altar, and rememberest that thy brother hath aught against thee, leave the gift before the altar, and first be reconciled to thy brother, and then coming offer the gift (Matt. 5:23–24). “Offering a gift upon the altar” signifies all Divine worship, for the reason that Divine worship with that nation consisted chiefly in offering burnt offerings and sacrifices, by which therefore all things of worship were signified (see Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, n. 214,"

      "text": "APOCALYPSE EXPLAINED 770 221). From this it can be seen that “praying,” or “supplicating,” and “offering a gift upon the altar,” have a like meaning, namely, worship from the good of love and charity. [10] In the same: Jesus said, It is written, my house shall be called a house of prayer, but ye have made it a den of robbers (Matt. 21:13; Mark 11:17; Luke 19:46). The Lord’s “house” signifies the church, and “prayers” worship therein; and a “den of robbers” the profanation of the church and of worship; and from this contrary sense it is also evident that prayers signify worship from the good of love and charity. [11] In David: I cried unto God with my mouth. If I had regarded iniquity in my heart the Lord would not have heard; but God hath heard; he hath attended to the voice of my prayer (Ps. 66:17–19). Since prayers are such as the man’s heart is, and thus are not prayers of any worship when the heart is evil, it is said, “If I had regarded iniquity in my heart the Lord would not have heard,” which signifies that he would not receive such worship. Man’s “heart” is his love, and man’s love is his very life, consequently a man’s prayers are such as his love is, that is, such as his life is; from which it follows that “prayers” signify the life of his love and charity, or that this life is meant by “prayers” in the spiritual sense. [12] Many more passages might be cited; but as man does not know that his life and his prayers make one, and therefore does not perceive otherwise than that “prayers” where they are mentioned in the Word mean merely prayers, these passages will be omitted here. Moreover, when man is in a life of charity he is constantly praying, if not with the mouth yet with the heart; for that which is of the love is constantly in the thought, even when man is unconscious of it (according to what is said in the Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, n."

But those who place piety in prayers and not in the life have no relish for this truth, in fact their thought is contrary to it; such do not even know what practical piety is. 326a. Verse 9. And they were singing a new song, signifies acknowledgment and confession from joy of heart. This is evident from the signification of a “song,” as meaning acknowledgment and confession from joy of heart, here acknowledgment and confession that the Lord in respect to the Divine human has all power in the heavens and on earth. Confession respecting this is meant because this is what is here treated of. “To sing a song” signifies confession from joy of heart, because joy of heart, when it is in fullness, expresses itself in song, this it does because when the heart, and in consequence the thought also, is full of joy, it pours itself forth in singing, the joy of the heart itself through the sound of the singing, and the joy of the thought therefrom through the song. The kind of joy of the thought is expressed by the words of the song, which concur and agree with the matter that is in the thought from the heart; the kind of joy of the heart is expressed by the harmony, and the measure of this joy is expressed by the exaltation of the sound and the words in it. All these flow as if spontaneously from the joy itself, and for the reason that the whole heaven is formed according to the affections of good and truth, the highest heaven according to the affections of good, and the middle heaven according to the affections of truth; it is therefore formed also for joys, for every joy is from an affection, or from love; from this it is that in all angelic discourse there is a kind of harmony. (But these things can be more clearly known and concluded by what is said and shown in Heaven and Hell, namely, that the thoughts and affections of angels go forth according to the form of heaven, n. 200–212, and 265–275; therefore that there is a kind of harmony in their speech, n. 242; also that the sound of the speech of angels corresponds to their affections; and the articulations of sound, which are the words, correspond to the ideas of thought, which are from the affection, n. 236, 241; also in Arcana Coelestia, 1648, 1649, 2595, 2596, 3350, 5182, 8115.)"

      "text": "APOCALYPSE EXPLAINED 772 From this it is clear that harmony in song, and also the power of musical art to express the various kinds of affections and to adapt itself to its themes, are from the spiritual world, and not from the natural as is believed (see also concerning this in Heaven and Hell, n. 241). [2] For this reason many kinds of musical instruments were used in sacred worship with the Jewish and Israelitish nation, some of which had relation to the affections of celestial good, and some to the affections of spiritual good, and to the joys therefrom, respecting what was to be proclaimed. Stringed instruments had relation to the affections of spiritual good, and wind instruments to the affections of celestial good; to these was added the singing of songs, which gave form to the agreements of things with the sounds of affections. Such were all the psalms of David, therefore they are called psalms, from playing [psallere], and also songs. This makes clear why the four animals and twenty-four elders are said to have had harps, and also to have sung this song. 326b. [3] That “singing” and “singing a song” signify acknowledgment and confession from joy of heart is evident from the following passages. In Isaiah: In that day thou shalt say, I will confess to Jehovah; O God of my salvation, I will trust, I will not dread; for Jah Jehovah is my strength and psalm, he is become my salvation. Then shall ye draw waters from the fountains of salvation. And in that day shall ye say, Confess ye to Jehovah, call upon his name, sing psalms unto Jehovah. Break forth and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion, for great in the midst of thee is the holy one of Israel (Isa. 12:1–6). This describes confession from joy of heart because of the Lord’s coming and his Divine power to save the human race. Confession is plainly meant, for it is first said, “I will confess to Jehovah,” and again afterwards, “Confess ye to Jehovah.” Confession that the Lord from his Divine power is about to save mankind is described by these words, “O God of my salvation, I will trust, I will not dread, for he is my strength, he is become my salvation. Then ye shall draw waters from the fountains of salvation in that day; great"

[4] In the same: Sing unto Jehovah a new song, his praise, O end of the earth. Let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up their voice; let the inhabitants of the cliff sing aloud, let them shout from the top of the mountains (Isa. 42:10–11). This also treats of the Lord’s coming and the establishment of the church with those who were outside of the church, that is, with those where the Word was not, and the Lord was not before known. “To sing a new song” signifies confession from joy of heart; “sing praise, O end of the earth” signifies confession of those who are remote from the church, “end of the earth” meaning where that which pertains to the church ceases to be, “earth” meaning the church; “the wilderness and the cities thereof that shall lift up the voice” signify those with whom there is no good because there is no truth, and yet they desire it; “the inhabitants of the cliff” signify the good of faith pertaining to them; “the top of the mountains” signifies the good of love pertaining to them; “to sing” and “to shout” signify consequent confession from joy of mind and heart.

As “psalm” and “song” signify confession from joy of heart, it is said, “joy and gladness therein, confession and the voice of a psalm,” “voice of a psalm” meaning song. [6] In Lamentations: The elders have ceased from the gate, the young men from singing; the joy of our heart hath ceased (Lam. 5:14–15). “The elders have ceased from the gate” signifies that those who are in truths from good, or in an abstract sense truths from good by which there is admission into the church, are no more; “the young men have ceased from singing” signifies that truths themselves are deprived of their spiritual affection, and thence of their joy; and because this is signified it is said, “the joy of our heart hath ceased.” [7] In Ezekiel: I will cause the tumult of thy songs to cease, and the voice of harps shall be no more heard (Ezek. 26:13). “The tumult of songs” signifies the joys of confessions; “the voice of harps” signifies gladness from spiritual truths and goods. [8] In David: Jehovah is my strength, and I am helped; my heart triumphs, and with my song will I confess to him (Ps. 28:7). Because “song” signifies confession from joy of heart, it is said “my heart triumphs, and with my song will I confess to him.”"

As joy of heart is both from celestial love and from spiritual love, it is said, “Sing aloud, ye righteous, in Jehovah, confess to Jehovah with the harp; sing psalms to him with a psaltery of ten strings”; “sing aloud, ye righteous,” is predicated of those who are in celestial love; “Confess on the harp, and sing psalms with the psaltery,” of those who are in spiritual love.

All these things are said “to sing,” “to break forth,” “to shout for joy,” “to cry aloud,” and “to clap the hands,” when they are from heaven, for then heavenly joy is in them, and through them in man; for man is not in heavenly joy unless the things in him, which are truths and goods, are from heaven; from these is joy of heart that is truly joy, and from these is the joy of the man with whom they are. From this it can be seen why the like is said of these things as of man, namely, because joy is in them, and with man through them.

This is evident from all that precedes; for the subject treated of up to this point is that the Lord from the Divine human has omnipotence and omniscience, and that judgment, therefore, belongs to him. That this is meant by “worthy art thou to open the book and to loose the seals thereof” is clear from the series of the things explained from the beginning of this chapter to the present verse, which I will here present in their order, as follows: “I saw in the right hand of him that sat upon the throne” signifies the Lord in respect to omnipotence and omniscience (n. 297); “a book written within and on the back, sealed with seven seals” signifies the states of the life of all in heaven and on earth altogether hidden (n. 299, 300); “I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a great voice, Who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof?” signifies exploration whether there is anyone such that he may know and perceive the state of the life of all (n. 302, 303); “no one was able, in heaven nor upon the earth nor under the earth, to open the book” signifies that no one from himself can do this at all (n. 304a); “behold the lion that is from the tribe of Judah, the root of David, hath overcome to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof” signifies the Lord [as able to do this] because from his own power he subjugated the hells and reduced all things in the heavens to order, and this by Divine good"

From this it is now clear that here “worthy art thou to take the book and to loose the seals thereof” signifies that the Lord from the Divine human has omnipotence and omniscience. 328a. For thou wast slain, and didst redeem us to God in thy blood, signifies the separation of all from the Divine, and the conjunction with the Divine by the acknowledgment of the Lord, and by the reception of Divine truth from him. This is evident from the signification of “being slain,” as being, in reference to the Lord, the separation of all from the Divine, for “to be slain” signifies in the Word to be spiritually slain, that is, to perish by evils and falsities (see above, n. 315); and because the Lord with such is not, for he is denied, therefore “being slain” signifies, in reference to the Lord, not acknowl edged (as above, n. 315) and also denied; and when the Lord is denied he is as it were slain with such as deny, and by the denial they are separated from the Divine; for such as deny the Lord, that is, his Divine, separate themselves altogether from the Divine. For the Lord is the God of the universe, and he is one with the Father, and the Father is in him and he in the Father, and no one cometh to the Father but by him, as the Lord himself teaches; consequently those in the church who do not acknowledge his Divine, and still more those who in heart deny it, are altogether separated from the Divine. [2] Denying the Divine is here meant by slaying him with themselves. In the internal sense of the Word the same is meant by “crucifying the Lord” (see above, n. 83, 195c); for the Jews, with whom the church then was, denied that he was the Christ, and thereby separated themselves from the Divine and therefore they gave him up to death, or crucified him. Moreover, at this day those who deny his Divine do the same; it is therefore frequently said by preachers that those who lead an evil life and blaspheme the Lord"

This, therefore, is what is here signified by “thou wast slain.” This is evident also from the signification of “thou didst redeem us to God in thy blood,” as being that he conjoined us to the Divine by the acknowledgment of him, and by the reception of Divine truth from him; for “to redeem” signifies to liberate from hell, and thereby to appropriate men to himself, and thus enjoin them to the Divine, as will be seen from the passages in the Word in which “to redeem” and “redemption” are mentioned, which will be quoted below. The “blood of the Lord” signifies Divine truth proceeding from him; and because man by the reception of Divine truth from the Lord is liberated from hell and conjoined to him, therefore “thou didst redeem us to God in thy blood” signifies conjunction with the Divine by the reception of the Divine truth from the Lord. [3] That this sense lies hidden in these words no one can see who abides in the mere sense of the letter, for in that sense nothing else can be seen except that “thou wast slain” means that he was crucified and “thou didst redeem us in thy blood” means that he has reconciled us to his Father by the passion of the cross. Because this meaning is the meaning of the letter, and because it has hitherto been unknown that in the particulars of the Word there is an internal sense which is spiritual, from that sense, namely, the sense of the letter, it has been made a doctrine of the church that the Divine itself which they call the Father cast away from him the whole human race, and that the Lord by the passion of the cross made reconciliation, and that thus those for whom he intercedes are saved. Who that has any illumination of understanding cannot see that this doctrinal is contrary to the Divine itself? For the Divine itself never casts away any man from him for he loves all, and therefore desires the salvation of all. It is also contrary to the Divine itself to be reconciled by the shedding of blood, and to be brought back to mercy by beholding the passion of the cross which his own son sustained, and from this to have mercy, and not from himself. Although this doctrine is so contrary to the Divine essence, yet to believe this is called essential faith or justifying faith."

But although this is the doctrine of those who never think beyond the sense of the letter, yet the angels who are with men have no perception of these things according to that sense, but according to the spiritual sense, for they are spiritual and therefore think spiritually and not naturally. To angels, “redeeming man in his blood” means liberating man from hell, and thus claiming and conjoining man to himself by the acknowledgment of him, and by the reception of Divine truth from him. Moreover, the church may know that this is so; for it may know that no one is conjoined to the Divine by blood, but by the reception of the Divine truth, and the application of it to the life. [5] Liberation from hell by the Lord was accomplished by his assuming the human, and through it subjugating the hells, and reducing to order all things in the heavens, which could have been done in no way except by the human; for the Divine operates from firsts through ultimates, thus from himself through the things that are from himself in ultimates, which are in the human. This is the operation of Divine power in heaven and in the world. (On this see some things above, n. 41; also in Heaven and Hell, n. 315; and in Arcana Coelestia, n. 5897, 6239, 6451, 6465, 8603, 9215, 9216, 9824, 9828, 9836, 10044, 10099, 10329, 10335, 10548.) Liberation from hell by the Lord was also accomplished by his glorifying his human, that is, making it Divine; for thus and not otherwise could he hold the hells in subjection forever; and as the subjugation of the hells and the glorification of his human was accomplished by means of temptations admitted into his human, his passion of the cross was his last temptation and complete victory. That “He bore the sins of all” signifies that he admitted into himself all the hells when he was tempted, for from the hells all sins or evils ascend, and enter into man and are in him; therefore the Lord’s “bearing sins” signifies that he admitted the hells into himself when tempted; and his “taking away sins” means that he subjugated the hells, in order that evils may no more rise up"

It was said that “thou didst redeem us to God in thy blood” signifies conjunction with the Divine by the acknowledgment of the Lord, and the reception of Divine truth from him; and as the church is founded on this, I will state briefly how conjunction is thereby effected. [6] The primary thing is to acknowledge the Lord, to acknowledge his Divine in the human, and his omnipotence to save the human race; for by that acknowledgment man is conjoined to the Divine, since there is no Divine except in him; for the Father is there; for the Father is in him, and he in the Father, as the Lord himself teaches; consequently they who look to another Divine near him, or at his side, as those are wont to do who pray to the Father to have mercy for the sake of the son, turn aside from the way and worship a Divine elsewhere than in him. Moreover, they then give no thought to the Divine of the Lord, but only to the human, when yet these cannot be separated; for the Divine and the human are not two, but a single person, conjoined like soul and body, according to the doctrine received by the churches from the Athanasian Creed. Therefore to acknowledge the Divine in the Lord’s human, or the Divine human, is the primary thing of the church, by which there is conjunction; and because it is the primary it is also the first thing of the church. It is because this is the first thing of the church, that the Lord, when he was in the world, so often said to those whom he healed, “Believest thou that I can do this?” and when they answered that they believed, he said, “Be it done according to thy faith.” This he so often said that they might believe, in the first place, that from his Divine human he had Divine omnipotence, for without that belief the church could not be begun, and without that belief they could not have been conjoined with the Divine, but must have been separated from it, and thus would not have been able to receive anything good from him."

From this it can be seen that these two things, namely, believing in the Lord and doing his words, make one, and can by no means be separated; for he who does not do the Lord’s words does not believe in him; so also he who thinks that he believes in him and does not do his words does not believe in him, for the Lord is in his words, that is, in his truths, and by them he gives faith to man. From these few things it can be known that conjunction with the Divine is effected through the acknowledgment of the Lord and the reception of Divine truth from him. This, therefore, is what is signified by “the lamb redeeming us to God in his blood.” That “the lamb” signifies the Lord in respect to the Divine human, see above (n. 314). (On this more may be seen in Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, n. 293–297, and in the quotations from Arcana Coelestia, n. 300–306, as also at the end of that work, where the Lord is particularly treated of.) 328c. That “blood” signifies the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord, and “salvation by his blood” signifies by the reception of Divine truth from him, will be explained in the following article. [8] That “to redeem” signifies to deliver and to make free, and, in reference to the Lord, to deliver and free from hell, and thus to set apart and conjoin to himself, can be seen from the following passages. In Isaiah: Who is this that cometh from Edom, walking in the multitude of his power? I that speak in righteousness, great to save. For the day of vengeance is in my heart, and the year of my redeemed hath come. In all their straitness he was in straitness and the angel of his faces saved them; because of his love and his pity he redeemed them; and he took them up and carried them all the days of eternity (Isa. 63:1, 4, 9). This treats of the Lord and his temptation-combats, by which he subjugated the hells. “Edom from which he cometh” signifies his human, so also does “the angel of his faces.” His Divine power"

For the day of vengeance is in my heart, and the year of my redeemed hath come.” His Divine love from which he did these things is described by “In all their straitness he was in straitness, and the angel of his faces saved them; because of his love and his pity he redeemed them; and he took them up and carried them all the days of eternity.” From this it is clear that “the redeemed” and “those whom he redeemed” signify those whom he rescued from the fury of those who are from hell, and whom he saved. [9] In the same: Thus hath said Jehovah thy creator, O Jacob, and thy former, O Israel; for I have redeemed thee, I have called thee by thy name; thou art mine (Isa. 43:1). That “to redeem” signifies to free from hell, and to set apart and conjoin to himself so that they may be his, is clear, for it is said, “I have redeemed thee, I have called thee by thy name; thou art mine”; because this is effected through reformation and regeneration by the Lord, therefore it is said, “Jehovah thy creator, O Jacob, and thy former, O Israel.” He is called creator because “to create” in the Word signifies to regenerate (see above, n. 294). “Jacob” and “Israel” signify those who are of the church, and are in truths from good. [10] In the same: Say ye to the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy salvation cometh; behold, his reward is with him, and the wages of his work are before him. And they shall call them a people of holiness, the redeemed of Jehovah (Isa. 62:11–12).

In the same: No lion shall be there, and the ravenous of the wild beasts shall not be found therein; but the redeemed shall go; and the ransomed of Jehovah shall return, and come to Zion with singing, and the gladness of eternity shall be upon their head (Isa. 35:9–10). This also treats of the Lord’s coming, and the salvation of those who suffer themselves to be regenerated by the Lord. That with such there shall not be falsity destroying truth nor evil destroying good, is signified by “No lion shall be there, and the ravenous of the wild beasts shall not be found therein”; that such are delivered from evils and freed from falsities is signified by “the redeemed shall go; so shall the ransomed of Jehovah return”; their eternal happiness is signified by “they shall come to Zion with singing, and the gladness of eternity shall be upon their head,” “Zion” meaning the church. What “singing” signifies see just above (n. 326a, b). There are two words in the original by which “to redeem” is expressed, one signifying deliverance from evils, the other liberation from falsities; these two words are used here; thus it is said, “the redeemed shall go,” and “the ransomed of Jehovah shall return.” (These two words are also used in Hosea 13:14; and in David, Ps. 69:18; 107:2.) 328d. [12] “To redeem” signifies to deliver from evils and to free from falsities, and also to deliver and free from hell, because all evils and falsities with man arise out of hell; and since the Lord removes these by reformation and regeneration, reformation and regeneration also are signified by “to redeem” or “redemption,” as in the following passages.

In Hosea: Out of the hand of hell will I ransom them; I will redeem them from death (Hos. 13:14). “To redeem” meaning to deliver and free from damnation.

[14] In David: Let Israel hope in Jehovah, for with Jehovah there is mercy, and in him is much ransom, and he shall ransom Israel out of all his iniquities (Ps. 130:7–8). “Ransom” means liberation; “Israel” the church; and to reform those who are of the church and free them from falsities is signified by “He shall ransom Israel out of all his iniquities.” In the same: Let integrity and uprightness preserve me; for I have waited for thee. Ransom Israel, O God, out of all his distresses (Ps. 25:21–22). “To ransom Israel out of distresses” means here also to free those who are of the church from falsities, which straiten.

That “ransoming” means liberation is evident, for it is said also, “Is my hand shortened, or is there no power in me to rescue.” In David: God shall hear my voice; he shall ransom my soul in peace (Ps. 55:17–18); “to ransom” here means to free.

In the same: Into thine hand I will commend my spirit; thou hast ransomed me, O Jehovah, God of truth (Ps. 31:5); “to ransom” means to free from falsities and to reform by means of truths; and because this is signified by “ransom” it is said, “O Jehovah, God of truth.” In the same: Crime is in the hands of sinners, and their right hand is full of a bribe.

My people went down into Egypt to sojourn there, but Assyria oppressed them for nought (Isa. 52:3–4). This treats of the desolation of truths by knowledges and by the reasonings of the natural man from them; for “my people went down into Egypt to sojourn there” signifies the instruction of the natural man in knowledges and cognitions of truth; “Egypt” signifies knowledges and also cognitions, but such as are from the sense of the letter of the Word; and “to sojourn” signifies to be instructed; “Assyria oppressed them for nought” signifies the falsification of knowledges by the reasonings of the natural man; “Assyria” signifying reasonings, and “to oppress for nought” falsifications, for falsities are nought because there is nothing of truth in them. Knowledges are thus falsified when the natural man separate from the spiritual forms conclusions; this is why it is said, “For nought ye have been sold, and not by silver shall ye be redeemed”; “for nought to be sold” signifies from self or from the selfhood to alienate oneself from falsities and renounce them; and “not by silver to be redeemed” signifies that one cannot be delivered by means of truth from the falsities of evil; “silver” signifying truth, and “to be redeemed” signifying to be delivered from the falsities of evil and to be reformed."

This treats of the restoration of the church, and reformation by means of truth from good; and “I will bring them together, because I will ransom them” signifies the dispersion of falsities and reformation by means of truths; therefore it is said, “they shall be multiplied, and I will sow them among the peoples,” which signifies the multiplication and insemination of truth from good; “to bring them back out of the land of Egypt, and to bring them together out of Assyria” signifies (as above) to withdraw them from the falsifying of truth that they are in by their reasonings from knowledges; “to lead them to the land of Gilead and to Lebanon” signifies to the good of the church, which is the good of charity, and to the good and truth of faith; the former is “the land of Gilead” and the latter “Lebanon.” 328e.

In Moses: I will put a ransom between my people and Pharaoh’s people (Exod. 8:23).

In Isaiah: Fear not, thou worm of Jacob, and ye mortals of Israel; I am he that helpeth thee, and thy redeemer the holy one of Israel (Isa. 41:14). Thus said Jehovah, the redeemer of Israel, his holy one, because of Jehovah who is faithful, the holy one of Israel, who hath chosen thee (Isa. 49:7).

That all flesh may know that I Jehovah am thy savior and thy redeemer, the mighty one of Jacob (Isa. 49:26). That thou mayest know that I Jehovah am thy savior and thy redeemer, the mighty one of Jacob (Isa. 60:16). By the “holy one of Israel,” and the “mighty one of Jacob,” who is here called “redeemer,” is meant the Lord in respect to the Divine human, and by “Jehovah” is meant his Divine itself. The Lord in respect to his Divine human is called “the holy one of Israel,” and “the mighty one of Jacob,” and the “strong one of Jacob,” because “Israel” and “Jacob” signify the church, thus those who are regenerated and reformed, that is, redeemed by the Lord, for these alone are of the church, that is, constitute the church of the Lord. [21] That the Lord’s Divine human is what is called “the holy one” is evident in Luke: The angel said unto Mary, The Holy Spirit shall come upon thee, and the power of the most high shall overshadow thee; therefore the holy thing born of thee shall be called the son of God (Luke 1:35)."

He shall be great, and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there shall be no end (Luke 1:30–33). “The house of Jacob” evidently means the Lord’s church, not the Jewish nation. [22] Because the Lord’s human was equally Divine with his Divine itself that took on the human, Jehovah is called “the Redeemer” in the following passages. In Isaiah: Thus said Jehovah thy redeemer, the holy one of Israel, I am Jehovah thy God (Isa. 48:17). Jehovah of hosts is his name; and thy redeemer, the holy one of Israel the God of the whole earth shall he be called (Isa. 54:5). In David: O Jehovah, my9 rock and my redeemer (Ps. 19:14). In Jeremiah: Their redeemer is strong; Jehovah of hosts is his name (Jer. 50:34). ln Isaiah: Thou, O Jehovah, art our Father, our redeemer; from everlasting is thy10 name (Isa. 63:16). From this it can now be seen how this saying of the Lord is to be understood: The son of man came to give his soul a redemption for many (Matt. 20:28; Mark 10:45);"

Since it is said, “thou didst redeem us to God in thy blood,” and since this is understood within the church entirely according to the sense of the letter, and not according to any spiritual sense, I will also show that “blood” does not mean blood, or the Lord’s suffering on the cross, but Divine truth proceeding from the Lord, and the reception of it by man; thus that “thou didst redeem us in thy blood” means that he has delivered and freed from hell those who acknowledge him, and receive Divine truth from him (as was said above, n. 328). In illustration of this matter I will cite the following. Because all things that were commanded in the Israelitish church were representative of things celestial and spiritual, and not the least thing was not so, it was also commanded, when the paschal supper was first instituted: That they shall take of the blood, and put it on the two side posts and on the lintel upon the houses wherein they shall eat [the paschal lamb]; and the blood shall be for you for a sign upon the houses where ye are; and when I see the blood I will pass over you, nor shall there be a plague upon you from the destroyer when I shall smite the land of Egypt. And further: Ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and shall touch the lintel and the two side posts with the blood that is in the basin; and not a man of you shall go out of the entrance of his house until the morning. And Jehovah will pass through to smite Egypt; and when he shall see the blood upon the lintel and upon the two side posts, Jehovah will pass over the door, and will not suffer the smiter to come into your houses to strike you (Exod. 12:7, 13, 22–23). He who does not know that there is a spiritual sense in the Word believes that “blood” here signifies the Lord’s blood upon the cross; but this is not at all the meaning in heaven; but to the angels there the paschal supper here described has a like meaning as the holy supper instituted by the Lord, in which, in place of the paschal lamb, there are the bread and the wine; and the Lord then said that the bread was his flesh and the wine was his blood; and everyone"

[2] Spiritual food is all the good that is communicated and given to man by the Lord, and spiritual drink is all the truth that is communicated and given to man by the Lord. These two, namely, good and truth, or love and faith, make man spiritual; it is said, or love and faith, because all good is of love, and all truth is of faith. From this it can be seen that “bread” means the Divine good of the Lord’s Divine love, and in reference to man, this good received by him; also that “wine” means the Divine truth that proceeds from the Divine good of the Lord’s Divine love, and in reference to man, this truth received by him. Since the Lord says that his flesh is bread, and his blood is wine, it can be seen that “the Lord’s flesh” means the Divine good of his Divine love, and “to eat” it means to receive it, and make it one’s own, and thus to be conjoined to the Lord; and that “the Lord’s blood” means the Divine truth that proceeds from the Divine good of his Divine love, and that “drinking” it means to receive that truth and make it one’s own, and thus be conjoined to the Lord. [3] Again, spiritual nourishment is from the good and truth that proceed from the Lord, as all nourishment of the body is from food and drink; their correspondence also is from this, which is such that where anything of food, or that serves for food, is mentioned in the Word, good is meant, and where anything of drink, or that serves for drink, is mentioned, truth is meant. From this it can be seen that the “blood” from the paschal lamb, which the sons of Israel were commanded to put upon the two side posts and upon the lintel of their houses, means Divine truth proceeding from the Lord; this, when received in faith and life, protects man against the evils that rise up out of hell; for in his Divine truth the Lord is with man, for this is the Lord’s own with man, yea, it is himself with man. Who that thinks from sound reason cannot see that the Lord is with a man not in his blood, but in his Divine, which is the good"

[4] From what has now been said, without further explanation, the significance of the Lord’s words when he instituted the holy supper is evident: As they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed, broke, and gave to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body. And he took the cup, and having given thanks, he gave to them, saying, Drink of it, all of you; for this is my blood of the new covenant, which is shed for many. I say unto you that I will not drink henceforth of this product of the vine until that day when I shall drink it with you in the kingdom of God (Matt. 26:26-29; Mark 14:22–25; Luke 22:15–20). As “wine” means Divine truth nourishing the spiritual life, therefore the Lord says to them, “I say unto you that I will not drink henceforth of this product of the vine until that day when I shall drink it with you new in the kingdom of God,” which shows clearly that something spiritual is meant, for he says that “he is to drink with them,” and “in the kingdom of God,” or in heaven, and also that “He is to eat” with them of the paschal lamb there (Luke 22:16). [5] What has now been said also makes clear what is signified by these words of the Lord: The bread that I will give is my flesh. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the son of man, and drink his blood, ye have not life in you. He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day. For my flesh is truly food, and my blood is truly drink. He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood abideth in me, and I in him. This is the bread that cometh down out of heaven (John 6:51–58).

[6] Since “blood” signifies the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord, and conjunction with the Lord is effected by man’s reception of it, therefore blood is called “the blood of the covenant,” for “covenant” signifies conjunction. Blood is called “the blood of the covenant” by the Lord when he instituted the Holy Supper, for he said: Drink of it, all of you; for this is my blood of the new covenant [or testament] (Matt. 26:27, 28; Mark 14:24; Luke 22:20). It is also called “the blood of the covenant” in Moses, where is the following: Moses came from Mount Sinai, and told the people all the words of Jehovah, and all the judgments. And Moses wrote all the words of Jehovah, and rose up early in the morning, and built an altar under the mount. And he sent young men of the sons of Israel, and they offered up burnt offerings, and sacrificed bullocks as peace offerings unto Jehovah. And Moses took half of the blood and put it in basins; and half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar. And he took the book of the covenant, and read in the ears of the people; and they said, All that Jehovah hath spoken will we do and hear. And he took the blood and sprinkled it on the people, and said, Behold the blood of the covenant that Jehovah hath concluded with you upon all these words.

That there is conjunction by means of the good in such truths, that is, by means of truths made truths of life, and that “blood” was a representative thereof, is very clear from the words there, for this was done when Moses descended from Mount Sinai, from which the law was promulgated, and also the statutes and judgments that were to be observed; and it is said that “Moses wrote all these words of Jehovah, and read them in the ears of the people,” who said, “All that Jehovah hath spoken will we do and hear,” which words they said twice (see verses 3 and 7). [7] Words or truths become truths of life by doing; and as Moses wrote these words, he called them, “the book of the covenant,” which signifies that there is conjunction by means of them. The law promulgated by Jehovah from Mount Sinai, and the statutes and judgments that were also commanded at that time, signified all Divine truth, or the Divine truth in its whole complex. This is why they are called “the book of the covenant,” and why the ark in which was that book is called “the ark of the covenant,” “covenant” signifying conjunction. Because Divine truth, by which there is conjunction, proceeds from the Lord, the Lord appeared to the people “under the feet as it were a work of sapphire stone”; that he so appeared “under the feet” signifying that Divine truth is such in ultimates. Divine truth in ultimates is Divine truth in the sense of the letter of the Word; “work of sapphire stone” signifies the translucence of this sense from Divine truth in the internal or spiritual sense; “the God of Israel” is the Lord. (That “sapphire stone” signifies translucence from internal truths, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 9407; and that “the God of Israel” is the Lord in respect to the Divine human, see above, n. 328f.)

They were inaugurated by oil and blood that they might be representative, because “oil” signified the Divine good of the Divine love, and “blood” the Divine truth proceeding therefrom, for truth proceeds from good. That inaugurations and sanctifications were made by means of oil will be seen in what follows, where they are treated of in their paragraph. Here let some things in which blood was used be mentioned, as: When Aaron and his sons were to be sanctified, blood was sprinkled upon the horns of the altar, and round about the altar, and upon Aaron and his sons, and upon their garments (Exod. 29:12, 16, 20–21; Lev. 8:24). Blood was sprinkled seven times before the veil that was over the ark, and upon the horns of the altar of incense (Lev. 4:6–7, 17–18). Before Aaron entered within the veil to the mercy seat, he should sacrifice and burn incense, and should sprinkle the blood with the finger seven times upon the mercy seat eastward (Lev. 16:12–15)."

The blood should be sprinkled upon the horns of the altar and thus expiation should be made for the altar (Exod 30:10; Lev. 16:18–19). Blood from the burnt offerings and sacrifices was sprinkled and poured out upon the altar, around the altar, or at its base, because the altar with the burnt offerings and sacrifices upon it represented and thence signified all worship from the good of love and the truths therefrom; and as truths proceed from good, therefore the blood was sprinkled on and poured out around the altar, for “around” signifies proceeding. [9] (But these things can be better seen from what has been shown respecting burnt offerings and sacrifices in Arcana Coelestia, as follows: “burnt offerings” and “sacrifices” signified all things of worship from the good of love, and the truths therefrom, n. 923, 6905, 8680, 8936, 10042. Therefore burnt offerings and sacrifices were called bread, n. 2165, because “bread” signifies everything that nourishes the spiritual life, n. 2165, 3478, 4976, 5147, 5915, 6118, 8410, 8418, 9323, 10686.

[10] When these things are understood it can be known that “the blood of the sacrifice” in other places also in the Word signifies Divine truth, as in Ezekiel: Say to the bird of every wing and to the beast of the field, Come together and come; gather yourselves from round about to my sacrifice that I do sacrifice for you, a great sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel; that ye may eat flesh and drink blood. Ye shall eat the flesh of the mighty and drink the blood of the princes of the earth. And ye shall eat fat to satiety, and drink blood to drunkenness, of my sacrifice which I sacrifice for you. And ye shall be satiated at my table with horse, with chariot, with every man of war. So will I give my glory among the nations (Ezek. 39:17–21). This treats of the restoration of the church; and “Israel” and “Jacob” mean all who are of the church, respecting whom these things therefore are said; “a great sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel” signifies all things of their worship; “flesh” and “fat” signify the good of love, and “blood” the truth from that good; worship is from these; an abundance of both is described by their “eating flesh and fat to satiety,” and “drinking blood to drunkenness,” and this “of the sacrifice”; it is therefore further said, “Ye shall be satiated at my table with horse, chariot, and every man of war,” for “horse” signifies the understanding of truth, “chariot” doctrine, and the “man of war” truth fighting against falsity and destroying it. Who cannot see that “blood” here does not mean blood, as that they “should drink the blood of the princes of the earth,” and “drink blood even to drunkenness, of the sacrifice?” “The princes of the earth” signify the principal truths of the church; therefore their “blood” signifies spiritual nourishment from those truths.

[11] In confirmation that the “beast of the field” and “bird” signify such things, I will quote here one passage only from the Word: In that day I will make a covenant for them with the beast of the field, and with the bird of the heavens, and with the creeping thing of the earth; and I will break the bow and the sword and war from the earth. And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; and I will betroth thee unto me in justice and in judgment, and in mercy and in compassions, and I will betroth thee unto me in truth (Hos. 2:18–20). “To make a covenant with the beast of the field and with the bird of the heavens” signifies with the affections of good and with spiritual truths, for with these the Lord is conjoined to man, since the Lord is in these with man; therefore it is called “a covenant” with them, “covenant” meaning conjunction. That “beasts” signify the affections of good, and “birds” things spiritual, will be fully shown in their paragraphs in what follows. [12] Because “fat” in sacrifices signified Divine good, and “blood” Divine truth, both from the Lord, and because by both when received by man conjunction was effected, therefore the posterity of Jacob, that is, the Jews and Israelites, were forbidden to eat any fat or any blood (see Lev. 3:17; 7:23–27; 17:11–14; Deut. 12:17, 23–25; 15:23). This was because that nation was not in any good of love, nor in any truth of good, but in the falsities of evil; and “to eat fat and blood” signified with them the mingling of truth from good with the falsity from evil, which is profanation; from which also it can be seen that “blood” signifies Divine truth."

[13] Because “blood” in the sacrifices signified Divine truth, therefore also: They were forbidden to sacrifice the blood of the sacrifice upon what was leavened (Exod. 23:18; 34:25); for “leaven” signifies falsity, and “what was leavened” truth falsified (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 2342, 7906, 8051, 9992). [14] The Lord’s “flesh” signifies the Divine good of the Divine love, and his “blood” signifies the Divine truth proceeding from that good, because there are two things that proceed from the Lord’s Divine human, namely, Divine good and Divine truth, the latter is his blood, and the former his flesh. That which proceeds is the celestial Divine and the spiritual Divine; and these constitute the heavens in general and in particular.

In general, the correspondence of the will is with the flesh, and the correspondence of the understanding with the blood; consequently the voluntary that is man’s own is meant in the Word by “flesh,” and the intellectual that is his own by “blood,” as in Matthew: Jesus said to Simon, blessed art thou, for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee (Matt. 16:17). These things are mentioned that it may be known that in the Word things voluntary and intellectual, that is, spiritual things, are meant by “flesh and blood” when man is referred to, and things Divine when the Lord is referred to.

The reception of Divine truth by them as being acceptable and grateful, is signified by “precious shall their blood be in his eyes,” “blood” here meaning Divine truth received. Their reformation is described by “he shall live, and to him shall he give of the gold of Sheba, and shall pray for him continually; all the day shall he bless him”; the “gold of Sheba” meaning the good of charity; “to pray for him continually” signifying that they shall be continually withheld from falsities and kept in truths, and “he shall bless him” signifying that they shall be continually in the good of charity and faith; it is therefore said further, “upon the top of the mountains his fruit shall be shaken”; the “top of the mountains” signifying heaven, from which they have the good of love from the Lord, which is “fruit.” [19] In Moses: The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; who shall bind to the vine his ass’s foal, and to the noble vine the son of his she-ass, whilst he shall wash his vesture in wine, and his covering in the blood of grapes (Gen. 49:10–11). This prophecy treats of the Lord, of whom it is said, “he shall bind to the vine his ass’s foal, and to the noble vine the son of his she- ass,” and “he shall wash his vesture in wine, and his covering in the blood of grapes”; “vine” signifying the church, and “wine” and the “blood of grapes” Divine truth. (For what the other things signify, see the explanation of these words in Arcana Coelestia, n. 6371–6377.) The like is meant by the “blood of grapes” in Deuteronomy (32:14); where the ancient church reformed by Divine truth is treated of. 329f. [20] From what has been shown in this and the preceding article it can be seen by those who acknowledge the spiritual sense of the Word that “thou didst redeem us to God in thy blood” means conjunction with the Divine by the acknowledgment of the Lord, and by the reception of Divine truth from him; also that the"

It is said, “the blood of the lamb” and “the word of testimony,” because “the blood of the lamb” signifies the reception of Divine truth from the Lord, and “the word of testimony” the acknowledgment of his Divine human. [21] That “blood” signifies Divine truth is still further evident from its contrary sense, in which “blood” signifies violence offered to Divine truth by the falsities of evil, and its destruction by these; and as what is signified in the genuine sense is also manifested by these contrary meanings, I will cite some passages in which “blood” and “bloods” have that significance. It is to be known that most things in the Word have also a contrary sense, and that from that sense it can be known what is signified in the genuine sense. The following will serve for illustration. In Revelation: The second angel poured out his bowl into the sea, and it became as the blood of one dead, and every living animal in the sea died. And the third angel poured out his bowl into the rivers and into the fountains of the waters, and they became blood (Rev. 16:3–4). The two witnesses have power over the waters to turn them into blood (Rev. 11:6). In Isaiah: The waters of Nimrim shall be desolations; and the waters of Dimon are full of blood (Isa. 15:6, 9). In David: He sent darkness and made it dark. He turned their waters into blood, and made their fish to die (Ps. 105:28–29)."

This contrary meaning is clear from its being said that the “waters” of “the sea,” of “rivers,” and of “fountains,” “were turned into blood”; for “waters” signify truths, therefore “blood” here signifies falsities that destroy truths. The “living animal in the sea,” and the “fish” signify truths known [vera scientifica]; so their “dying” and “being slain” by blood signify such truths also destroyed. (That “waters” signify truths, see above, n. 71; and that “fish” signify truths known of the natural man, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 40, 991.) [22] Again in Revelation: I saw when he had opened the sixth seal, and behold there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth, and the whole moon became blood (Rev. 6:12). In Joel: I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth; blood, and fire, and columns of smoke. The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great day of Jehovah come (Joel 2:30–31). Here also it is known from the contrary meaning that “blood” signifies violence offered to the Divine truth; for “sun” in the Word signifies the celestial Divine, which is the Divine good, and “moon” signifies the spiritual Divine, which is the Divine truth; it is therefore said that “the moon shall be turned into blood.” (That this is the signification of “moon” see Heaven and Hell, n. 118, 119.)

In David: Thou wilt destroy those that speak falsehood; the man of blood and deceit Jehovah abhorreth (Ps. 5:6); “the man of blood and deceit” meaning those who are in falsities from evil; it is therefore said, “Thou wilt destroy those that speak falsehood,” “falsehood” in the Word signifying falsities. In Isaiah: And it shall come to pass, that he that is left in Zion and he that remaineth in Jerusalem shall be called holy to him, everyone that is written unto life in Jerusalem. When the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have washed away the bloods of Jerusalem out of the midst thereof by the spirit of judgment and by the spirit of cleansing [burning] (Isa. 4:3–4). Because “Jerusalem” signifies the church in respect to doctrine, therefore it is said, “When he shall have washed away its blood out of the midst thereof,” “bloods” signifying the falsities of evil. The “spirit of judgment” signifies Divine truth, and because this purifies it is said, “by the spirit of cleansing” [burning]. [24] In Ezekiel: In the day wherein thou wast born I passed by beside thee, and I saw thee trodden down in thy bloods, and I said unto thee, In thy bloods, live; yea, I said unto thee, In thy bloods live. I washed thee, and I washed away thy bloods from upon thee, and I anointed thee with oil (Ezek. 16:5–6, 9, 22, 36, 38). This also treats of Jerusalem, which signifies the church in respect to the doctrine of truth, here first of the falsities of evil in which it was before it was reformed, and afterwards of its reformation; the falsities of evil are signified by its being seen “trodden down in bloods”; and its reformation by “he washed, and washed away the"

[25] In Lamentations: For the sins of the prophets of Jerusalem, and the iniquities of her priests, that have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her. They have wandered blind in the streets, they have been polluted with blood, what they cannot pollute they touch with their garments (Lam. 4:13–14). “Prophets of Jerusalem” signify those who are to teach the truths of doctrine, and “priests” those who are to lead by truths to good; here mentioned in a contrary sense, since it is said, “for their sins”; “to shed the blood of the just” signifies to falsify truths and adulterate goods; it is therefore said, “they have wandered blind in the streets, they have been polluted with blood, what they cannot pollute they touch with their garments”; “to wander blind in the streets” signifies not to see truths at all, “streets” meaning truths; “polluted with bloods” signifies to be wholly in falsities; “what they cannot pollute they touch with their garments” signifies that what they cannot pervert they nevertheless falsify, “garments” meaning the truths that invest interior things, which truths are the truths of the sense of the letter of the Word. In Isaiah: All uproar shall be whirled about by the earthquake, and the garment is polluted with bloods (Isa. 9:5); “earthquake” signifying the perversion of the church by the falsification of truth, and the “garment polluted with bloods” the falsification of the sense of the letter of the Word.

[27] In Isaiah: Your hands are full of bloods (Isa. 1:15). Your hands are polluted with blood, and your fingers with iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, and your tongue hath meditated perverseness. Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood; their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity (Isa. 59:3, 7). “Hands polluted with blood, and fingers with iniquity” signifies that in all things belonging to them there is falsity and the evil of falsity; “hands” and “fingers” signify power, thus all things with them that have power. Because this is the meaning it is also said, “your lips have spoken lies, and your tongue hath meditated perverseness,” “lies” meaning falsities, and “perverseness” the evil of falsity; “their feet make haste to shed innocent blood” signifies their hastening to destroy the good of love and charity; this is signified by “shedding innocent blood.” The good of innocence is that from which is every good and truth of heaven and the church (see Heaven and Hell, n. 276–283). From this it can be seen what is signified in a general sense by “bloods,” in the plural, namely, violence offered both to the truths and the goods of the Word and of the church. 329g. As “shedding innocent blood” signifies to destroy the good of love and of charity, every kind of precaution was taken that innocent blood should not be shed; and if it were shed: That expiation shall be made for the land (Deut. 19:10, 13; 21:1–9); for the “land” signifies the church."

The “bloods” that the earth shall reveal signify all the falsities and evils that have destroyed the truths and goods of the church, the “earth” being the church where these are; the “slain” signify those that have perished by falsities and evils. (That the “slain” signify those that have perished by falsities and evils, see above, n. 315.) In Revelation: In Babylon was found the blood of prophets and of saints, and of all that have been slain upon the earth (Rev. 18:24); “the blood of prophets and of saints” meaning truths and goods extinguished; and the “slain” those who have perished by falsities and evils (as just above). [29] The like is meant by: The blood of the prophets which was shed upon the earth, from the blood of Abel the just even to the blood of Zachariah, the son of Barachiah, whom they slew between the temple and the altar (Matt. 23:30, 34–35; Luke 11:50–51). In the spiritual sense, by “Abel” those who are in the good of charity are meant, and, abstractly from person, that good itself; and by “Cain” those who make faith alone the sole means of salvation, and the good of charity of no account, thus rejecting and slaying it; and by “Zachariah” those who are in the truths of doctrine are meant, and abstractly from person the truth itself of doctrine; therefore the “blood” of these two signifies the extinction of all good and truth; “whom they slew between the temple and the altar” signifies in the spiritual sense every kind of rejection of the Lord; for “temple” signifies the Lord in respect to Divine truth, and “altar” the Lord in respect to Divine good, and “between them” signifies both together."

That “between” the two signifies where there is a marriage of Divine truth and Divine good, n. 10001, 10025.) [30] In the Word it is often said of those condemned to death, that “their bloods should be upon them,” which means, in the spiritual sense, that damnation should be upon them because of the falsities and evils by which they had destroyed the truths and goods of the church; for in general “bloods” signify all the falsities of doctrine, of life, and of worship, by means of which come the evils that destroy the church. These evils are in part enumerated in Ezekiel (18:10–13); these are also signified by “bloods” in John: As many as received him, to them gave he power to become sons of God, to them that believe on his name; who were born, not of bloods nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God (John 1:12, 13). “The Lord’s name” means all truths and goods by which he is to be worshiped; “bloods” mean all the falsities and evils that destroy; “the will of the flesh” and “the will of man” signify all the evils of love and the falsities of faith, for “flesh” signifies the voluntary that is man’s own from which is every evil, and “man” signifies the intellectual that is man’s own, from which is every falsity, “will” meaning where these things are; “to be born of God” is to be regenerated by means of the truths of faith, and by means of a life according to them. 330.

That there are two kingdoms into which the heavens are divided, namely, the celestial kingdom and the spiritual kingdom, and that those who are in the good of love to the Lord are in the celestial kingdom, and those who are in the good of charity towards the neighbor are in the spiritual kingdom, see Heaven and Hell, (n. 20–28).

[2] In Isaiah: The strong people shall glorify thee, the city of the formidable nations shall fear thee. Jehovah will swallow up in this mountain the faces of the covering, that covereth over all peoples, and the veil that is veiled over all nations (Isa. 25:3, 7). Here a distinction is made between “peoples” and “nations,” because “peoples” signify those who are of the Lord’s spiritual kingdom, and “nations” those who are of his celestial kingdom, thus those who are in spiritual good and those in celestial good. Spiritual good is the good of charity towards the neighbor, thus the good of faith, and celestial good is the good of love to the Lord, and thence the good of mutual love. The truth of this good is what is meant by “the city of formidable nations,” for “city” signifies the doctrine of truth, or the truths of doctrine; “to swallow up the covering over all peoples, and the veil veiled over all nations” signifies to dispel the shade that has so covered the understanding that the truths are not seen or the goods perceived that pertain to heaven and the church. [3] In the same: Come near, ye nations, to hear; and hearken, ye peoples; let the earth hear, and the fullness thereof (Isa. 34:1). Because “nations” signify those who are in the good of love, and “peoples” those who are in the good of charity and in the truths of faith therefrom, it is said of the nations that they should “come near,” and of the peoples that they should “hearken”; to “come near” signifies to be conjoined by love, and to “hearken” signifies to obey and to be instructed; it is therefore said, “let the earth hear,"

Bring forth the blind people that have eyes, and the deaf that have ears. Let all the nations be brought together, and let the peoples gather together (Isa. 43:8–9). I have given him for a witness to the peoples, a prince and lawgiver to the nations (Isa. 55:4). Thus said the Lord Jehovih, Behold, I will lift up mine hand towards the nations, and lift up my standard towards the peoples (Isa. 49:22). The peoples that walk in darkness have seen a great light. Thou hast multiplied the nation, thou hast made great to it gladness (Isa. 9:2–3). It shall be in that day that the root of Jesse, which standeth for an ensign of the peoples, the nations shall seek. And he shall lift up an ensign for the nations, and shall gather together the outcasts of Israel (Isa. 11:10, 12). All these things are said of the Lord; and “peoples” and “nations” mean all who are of his church; for all who are of the Lord’s church are either of his celestial kingdom or of his spiritual kingdom; not any except those who are in these two kingdoms can possibly be of the church. Moreover, there are two things that constitute the church, good and truth, both from the Lord; “nations” mean those who are in good, and “peoples” those who are in truth; and, abstractly from persons, “nations” signify the goods of the church, and “peoples” its truths; “peoples” signify the truths of the church because spiritual good, or the good of charity towards the neighbor, in which those are who are meant by “peoples,” in its essence is"

This treats of the invitation of all to the church; therefore also “people” and “nation” are both mentioned. “Mount Zion” signifies the church, to which they are invited; “a people distracted and plundered” signifies those with whom truths have been taken away, changed, or perverted by those who are in the falsities of doctrine; “a nation meted out and trodden down, whose land the rivers have spoiled” signifies those with whom goods have been treated in like manner, “rivers” meaning falsities and reasonings therefrom. [6] In Zechariah: Yet there shall come peoples, and the inhabitants of great cities, to entreat the faces of Jehovah, and many peoples and numerous nations shall come to seek Jehovah of Hosts in Jerusalem (Zech. 8:20–22).

All nations shall see thy righteousness, and all kings thy glory (Isa. 62:2). In these passages “nations” and “peoples” are not mentioned together, but still in the last two “nations” and “kings” because “kings” signify the like as “peoples,” namely, those who are in truths (see above, n. 31); and it is because “nations” signify those who are in good, and “kings” those who are in truths, that it is said of the nations that they “shall see thy righteousness,” and of the kings that they shall “see thy glory”; “righteousness” in the Word being predicated of good, and “glory” of truth. (That “righteousness” is predicated in the Word of Divine good, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 2235, 9857; and “glory” of Divine truth, n. 4809, 5922, 8267, 8427, 9429.)"

In Isaiah: O Assyrian, the rod of mine anger, I will send him against a hypocritical nation, and against the people of my wrath will I command him (Isa. 10:5–6). The voice of a multitude in the mountains; the voice of a tumult of the kingdoms of the nations gathered together. They come from a land afar off, from the end of the heavens, even Jehovah with the vessels of his indignation to destroy the whole land (Isa. 13:4–5). Jehovah that smiteth the peoples with a stroke not curable, that ruleth with anger the nations (Isa. 14:6). At the noise of the tumult let the peoples flee away; and before thine exaltation let the nations be dispersed (Isa. 33:3). In Jeremiah: Behold, a people cometh from the land of the north, and a great nation shall be stirred up from the sides of the earth. They lay hold on the bow and spear; they are cruel, and have no mercy (Jer. 6:22–23). In Ezekiel: I will not cause thee to hear any more the calumny of the nations, and the reproach of the peoples thou shalt not bear any more (Ezek. 36:15). In David: Thou makest us a byword among the nations, a shaking of the head among the peoples (Ps. 44:14).

This is also the signification of the peoples and nations that were driven out of the land of Canaan. To this let what was said above (n. 175) be added. 332. Verse 10. And hast made us unto our God kings and priests, signifies that from the Lord they are in the truths and goods of the church and of heaven, as can be seen from what was shown above (n. 31), where there are like words. 333. And we shall reign upon the earth, signifies the power that belongs to the Lord alone through Divine truth united to Divine good, and power and wisdom therefrom that those have who are of the Lord’s spiritual and celestial kingdoms. This is evident from the signification of “to reign,” as being to be in truths and goods, and thence to be from the Lord in the power to resist the evils and falsities which are from hell; and since truths and goods are from the Lord alone, and truths have all power from good, “to reign” signifies the power that belongs to the Lord alone through Divine truth united to Divine good, and the power therefrom that those have who are in the Lord’s spiritual and celestial kingdoms. He who has no right understanding of the Word in the spiritual sense will suppose that such are to be like kings and priests, and are to reign with the Lord; but in the spiritual sense “kings” mean truths, and “priests” goods, abstractly from persons, that is, the truths and goods that are in persons from the Lord; from which it follows that it is truths from good that are to reign, thus the Lord alone from whom these are. The angels, indeed, are in great power, but not one of them from himself; yea, if anyone in heaven believes that he has power from himself he is instantly deprived of it, and then becomes wholly powerless. It is said in the sense of the letter that these are to reign, because the sense of the letter is personal; when therefore it is said in that sense that they are to be “kings and priests,” it is also said that they are “to reign”; but in the spiritual sense everything of person is put off, and thus everything of"

(That “disciples” mean all truths and goods of the church, which are from the Lord, see above, n. 100, 122.

It is said that they shall reign upon the earth, because the “earth” means the Lord’s church in the heavens and on the earth (see above, n. 304). It is clear, moreover, that “earth” here does not mean the earth, just as it is not meant that they were to be kings and priests. “To reign” signifies to be in truths from good, and thus in power and wisdom from the Lord, because “kingdom” signifies heaven and the church in respect to truths, and “king” truth from good. (That “kingdom” in the Word signifies heaven and the church in respect to truths, see above, n. 48; and “king” truth from good, also above, n. 31. “To reign” has a like signification in chap. 20:4, 6; 22:5.)"

For the heavens are higher and lower, differing from each other according to the reception of Divine truth and good, thus according to degrees of intelligence and wisdom. (But respecting the degrees according to which the heavens, and consequently the angels who are in them, are distant from each other, see Heaven and Hell, n. 33, 34, 38, 39, 208, 209, 211, 425.) What is below in accordance with these degrees is what is signified by “round about”; in like manner also, elsewhere in the Word, “round about,” “circuit,” “afar,” “distant,” “uttermost parts,” and the like, have a like signification. 336a. And the number of them was myriads of myriads and thousands of thousands signifies the innumerable who are in truths, and the innumerable who are in goods. This is evident from the signification of “number” as being quantity and quality, quantity in the natural sense, and quality in the spiritual sense, the number employed determining the quantity and quality. But still all numbers in the Word signify something pertaining to the thing, as “two,” “three,” “four,” “five,” “seven,” “ten,” and “twelve,” as has been shown where these are treated of; it is similar with “myriad” and “thousand,” which are here mentioned. The number “seven,” for example, signifies not seven, but all, what is full and whole (see above, n. 257). But what “myriads” and “thousands” signify shall now be said. “Myriads” signify things innumerable, “thousands” the like; but “myriads” are predicated of truths, and “thousands” of goods; this is why “myriads of myriads, and thousands of thousands” signify the innumerable who are in truths, and the innumerable who are in goods. [2] Those in the lower heavens of whom these things are said, in like manner as those in the higher heavens who were treated of above, are from two kingdoms, namely the spiritual kingdom and the celestial kingdom; those who are of the spiritual kingdom are meant by those who are in truths, while those who are of the celestial kingdom are meant by those who are in goods; the"

But when innumerable things that are infinitely many are to be expressed, they are called “myriads of myriads,” and “thousands of thousands.” [3] Moreover when two numbers related by multiplication, one larger and the other smaller, and having a like signification, are mentioned together, as “ten and a hundred,” or “a hundred and a thousand,” then the smaller is predicated of goods, and the larger of truths; and for the reason that each good consists of many truths; for good is formed out of truths, and thence good is produced by truths; on which account the larger number is predicated of truths, and the smaller of goods; in like manner here “myriads of myriads and thousands of thousands.” That it is so may be illustrated by this, that a single delight of affection may be presented by many ideas of thought, and be expressed by various things in speech; the delight of affection is what is called good, and the ideas of thought and the various things in the speech that proceed from that delight or good are what are called truths. It is similar with one thing of the will in respect to many things of its understanding, and also with one thing of love in respect to many things that express it. From this it is that “many” and “multitude” in the Word are predicated of truths, and “great” and “greatness” of good, for what is great contains in itself many things. But these things are said for those who can be enlightened by examples, that they may know why it is that “thousands,” the same as “myriads” signify things innumerable, but that “myriads” are predicated of truths, and “thousands” of goods. 336b.

These things are said of Joseph, who in a representative sense signifies the Lord in respect to the spiritual Divine and in respect to his spiritual kingdom (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 3969, 3971, 4669, 6417); his two sons “Ephraim” and “Manasseh” signify the two constituents of that kingdom, namely, intellectual truth and voluntary good, “Ephraim” intellectual truth, and “Manasseh” voluntary good; it is therefore said “the myriads of Ephraim and the thousands of Manasseh.” (That “Ephraim” and “Manasseh” have this signification, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 3969, 5351, 5353, 5354, 6222, 6234, 6238, 6267, 6296.)

(That “chariots” signify the truths of doctrine, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 2762, 5321, 8215; and that “peace” signifies the inmost of good, see Heaven and Hell, n. 284–290.) And because the Lord is called “Lord” from good, and “Sinai” signifies heaven where and from which is Divine truth, therefore it is said, “the Lord is in them, Sinai in the sanctuary,” “sanctuary” meaning heaven and the church where Divine truth is.

But what “a chiliad” or “a thousand” [chilias seu mille] signifies when “ten thousand,” that is, a “myriad,” is not joined with it, will be seen hereafter in its own article; likewise what is signified by “number.” 337. Verse 12. Saying with a great voice, Worthy is the lamb that was slain, signifies the acknowledgment from the heart that everything Divine is from the Lord’s Divine human unacknowledged and by many denied. This is evident from the signification of “saying with a great voice,” as being the acknowledgment from the heart (of which presently); also from the signification of “worthy,” as being, in reference to the Lord, merit and justice (respecting which see above, n. 293, 303); here therefore it signifies that from his own power, thus from merit, he acquired for himself everything Divine, and so from justice everything Divine is his. That this is meant by “he is worthy,” is evident from what immediately follows, namely, “to receive the power and riches and wisdom and honor and glory and blessing”; which in the complex signifies everything Divine.

There are two words that often occur in the Word, namely, “great” and “many,” and “great” is there predicated of good, and “many” of truths (for the reason see just above, n. 336a); and as what proceeds from good proceeds from the heart, here “saying with a great voice” signifies the acknowledgment from the heart; moreover, “heart” from correspondence signifies the good of love (see Heaven and Hell, n. 95, 447; and above, n. 167). 338. To receive the power and riches and wisdom signifies that to him belong omnipotence, omniscience, and Divine Providence. This is evident from the signification of “power,” as being, in reference to the Lord, omnipotence; from the signification of “riches,” as being, in reference to the Lord, omniscience; and from the signification of “wisdom,” as being, in reference to the Lord, Divine Providence. This is what is meant, because respecting the Lord nothing can be predicated except what is above all things; when, therefore, it is said that he has power it is meant that he has all power, which is omnipotence; and when it is said that he has riches it is meant that he has all spiritual riches, which signify intelligence and therefore omniscience (that “riches” in the Word signify the knowledges of truth and good and thus intelligence, may be seen above, n. 236); and when it is said that he has “wisdom,” it is meant that he has all wisdom, which is the Divine providence; for true wisdom is to see what is conducive to anyone’s life to eternity, and to determine oneself according to that, which is done when man not only knows these things and perceives them with his understanding, but also wills and does them; but Divine wisdom is to provide these things with man; thus it is Divine providence.

This is evident from the signification of “blessing,” as being the Lord, when said of the acknowledgment, here the acknowledgment that to him belong omnipotence, omniscience, providence, Divine good, and Divine truth, which are signified by “Worthy is he to receive the power, riches, wisdom, honor, and glory,” and as being also glorification on that account. Moreover, “blessing,” when said of the Lord, signifies thanksgiving that from him is every good of love and truth of faith, and thence heaven and eternal happiness to those who receive. Because “blessing” here signifies acknowledgment and glorification on that account, and also thanksgiving, blessing is mentioned in the last place, or as a conclusion by these angels, who were glorifying the Lord. These things are signified by “blessing,” when said of the Lord, because nothing is a blessing except what is given by the Lord, for that alone is blessed because it is Divine and eternal, and contains in itself heaven and eternal happiness; all other things which have not in themselves what is Divine and eternal are not blessings, even though they may be so called (see Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, n. 269, 270). [2] That “blessing” when it is mentioned in the Word, has this signification, can be seen from the places there when understood in the internal sense. But in the first place, some passages shall be quoted in which “blessed” and “blessing” are said of Jehovah, that is the Lord; also where the expression “to bless God” is used, that it may be seen that these signify the acknowledgment, glorification, and thanksgiving that from him is every good and truth, and thence heaven and eternal happiness to those who receive.

That “redemption” signifies liberation and deliverance from hell, see above (n. 328); and that “people” signifies those who are in truths from good (n. 331). [3] In the same: Simeon took the infant Jesus in his arms, and blessed God: and said, Mine eyes have seen thy salvation, which thou hast prepared before the face of all peoples (Luke 2:28–31). Here “to bless God” evidently means to glorify and give thanks because the Lord was to come into the world, to save all who receive him; consequently he calls the Lord “the salvation” which his eyes saw, which he prepares for all people. Those are called “his people” who are in truths from good, thus who by means of truths receive him, as was said above. [4] In David: They have seen thy goings, O God.

      "text": "APOCALYPSE EXPLAINED 835 “assemblies” in the Word are predicated of spiritual truths, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 6355, 7843.) Because “to bless in the assemblies” signifies glorification from spiritual truths, and “to bless from the fountain of salvation” signifies glorification from spiritual good, therefore in the first case the name “God” is used, and in the latter “Lord”; for the name “God” is used in the Word where truths are treated of, and “Jehovah” and “Lord” where good is treated of. It is clear that glorification is what is meant by “to bless,” from its immediately following after these words, “the singers went before, the minstrels after, in the midst of the maidens playing on timbrels,” which signifies glorification from spiritual truths and goods, as may be seen above (n. 323, 326). [5] In the same: O sing unto Jehovah a new song; sing unto Jehovah, all the earth. Bless his name; proclaim his salvation from day to day. Tell ye his glory among the nations (Ps. 96:1–3). “To bless Jehovah” here evidently is to glorify him and give thanks unto him; and because all glorification of him is from spiritual truths and from spiritual good, it is said, “Bless his name, proclaim his salvation from day to day”; “name” having reference to truths, and “salvation” to good. “To sing a song” signifies to glorify from such truths and from such goods (see above, n. 323b, c, 326d). [6] In Moses: Jehovah chose the sons of Levi to minister unto him, and to bless in the name of Jehovah (Deut. 10:8; 21:5). Because the sons of Levi were appointed for Divine worship, and because all Divine worship is effected from spiritual good and the truths therefrom, it is said that “Jehovah chose them to minister unto him, and to bless in his name”; “to minister” signifying worship from spiritual good, and “to bless” signifying worship from spiritual truths. That to “minister” has reference to worship from good, see above (n. 155)."

Glory and honor dost thou lay upon him. For thou settest him blessings forever (Ps. 21:3, 5–6). “The king” here does not mean David, but the Lord, who is called “king” from the spiritual Divine that proceeds from his Divine human; and because “blessing” signifies the acknowledgment, glorification, and thanksgiving because every good and truth, and thence heaven and eternal happiness, are from him, it is evident what is signified by “thou hast welcomed the king with the blessings of goodness,” and by “thou settest him blessings for ever.” “Blessings of goodness” signify truths from good; “a crown of fine gold” signifies the good from which truths are; “honor and glory” signify Divine good and Divine truth. (That “David” in the Word means the Lord, see above, n. 205; likewise “king” in the Psalms, n. 31a; that the “crown of kings” signifies Divine good, n. 272; likewise “gold,” n. 242a, d, e; and that “honor and glory signify Divine good and Divine truth, n. 288.) 340b. [8] From this it can be seen what “blessed” signifies when said of the Lord, as in the following passages: The disciples cried with a great voice, Blessed is the king that cometh in the name of the Lord (Luke 19:37–38). The throng cried, Hosanna to the son of David; Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord (Matt. 21:9; Mark 11:9, 10; John 12:12–13). Jesus said, Ye shall not see me henceforth, until ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord (Matt. 23:39; Luke 13:35). The high priest asked Jesus, Art thou then the Christ, the son of the blessed (Mark 14:61)."

The Lord’s “name” signifies everything by which he is worshiped; and as all this has reference to the good of love and the truth of faith, therefore these are signified by the Lord’s “name.” (That the Lord’s “name” signifies everything by which he is worshiped, see above, n. 102, 135, 148, 224; and that the Lord is called “Lord” from Divine good, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 4973, 9167, 9194.) [9] In Moses: Melchizedek blessed Abram, and said, Blessed be Abram to God most high, the possessor of heaven and earth; and blessed be God most high, who hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand (Gen. 14:18–20). Here it is said, “Blessed be God most high, who hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand” signifying that to him belong glorification and thanksgiving on that account. Those therefore who receive Divine good and Divine truth from the Lord, are called: Blessed (Ps. 37:22; 115:15; Matt. 25:34). [10] That “blessing” has no other meaning, when said of man, than the reception of Divine truth and Divine good, because in them are heaven and eternal happiness, can be seen from the following passages. In David: The clean in hands and the pure in heart shall receive a blessing from before Jehovah, and righteousness from the God of our salvation (Ps. 24:4–5). “The clean in hands” signify those that are in truths from faith, and “the pure in heart” those that are in good from love; of such it is said that they “shall receive a blessing from before Jehovah, and righteousness from the God of salvation,” and “receiving a blessing” signifies the reception of Divine truth, and “receiving righteousness” the reception of Divine good.

Thus shall they put my name upon the sons of Israel; and I will bless them (Num. 6:23–27). From this, unfolded by means of the internal sense, it is evident what “blessing” as a whole involves—namely, that Jehovah, that is, the Lord, from Divine love flows in with Divine truth and with Divine good with those who receive; the Divine love, from which the Lord flows in, being meant by “the faces of Jehovah”; the Divine truth, with which the Lord flows in, by “Jehovah make his faces to shine upon thee”; and the Divine good, with which he flows in, by “Jehovah lift up his faces upon thee”; the protection from evils and falsities, which would otherwise take away the influx, by “keep thee” and “be gracious unto thee”; heaven and eternal happiness, which the Lord gives by means of his Divine truth and his Divine good, by “give thee peace”; communication and conjunction with those who receive, by “thus shall they put my name upon the sons of Israel,” “the name of Jehovah” signifying the Divine proceeding, which is called in general Divine truth and Divine good, and “the sons of Israel” signifying those who are of the church, thus who receive, of whom it is therefore said, “and I will bless them.” This is the internal or spiritual sense of these words, as can be seen from this, that “the faces of Jehovah” signify the Divine love; “to make them to shine” signifies the influx of Divine truth, and “to lift them up” signifies the influx of Divine good. That these things may be better understood, the ground of these significations shall be told. The Lord appears to the angels in heaven as a sun; for it is his Divine love that so appears; this, therefore, is what is meant by the “face” of Jehovah; the light that proceeds therefrom is Divine truth; this, therefore, is what is meant"

He who sees the Word merely in its natural sense believes no other than that “blessing” means such things as are mentioned in that sense, namely, that rain should be given to make fruitful the gardens and fields, and thus the tree should yield its fruit and the land its produce; but it is a spiritual blessing that is meant, for “rain” signifies everything Divine that flows into man from the Lord out of heaven. That truths will produce good, and that good will produce truths, is signified by “the tree shall yield its fruit, and the land its produce,” “land” and also the “garden,” in which there are trees, meaning the church; these and “the circuits of my hill which are to be given as a blessing” signify the internal and external with the men of the church, “circuit” signifying what is outside or below, and “hill” what is within or above, especially where charity is, for that is within.

Jehovah shall bless thee out of Zion; that thou mayest see the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life; peace upon Israel (Ps. 128:1–6). Here also “to be blessed” does not mean to be blessed naturally, as that one is to eat the labor of his hands, that his wife is to be fruitful, that many sons are to be about his tables, and that this is to be in Zion and in Jerusalem, but it means to be blessed spiritually; for “those that fear Jehovah” mean those who love to do his commandments; it is therefore said, “Blessed is he that feareth Jehovah, that walketh in his ways,” “to walk in his ways” signifying to do his commandments; “the labor of his hands which he shall eat” signifies the pursuit of the life according to those commandments; “the wife by the sides of the house” signifies the affection of spiritual truth in all things that he thinks and does; therefore it is added, “as a fruitful vine,” for “vine” signifies the spiritual church from the affection of truth; “sons around the tables” signify the truths of good therefrom, “tables” meaning instructions; therefore it is also said, “as olive plants,” “plants” signifying truths, and “olives” goods; “Zion” signifies heaven whence these things are; and “Jerusalem” doctrine.

And he will bless the fruit of thy belly, and the fruit of thy ground, thy corn, and thy new wine, and thine oil, the young of thy kine and of the rams of thy flock. Thou shalt be blessed above all peoples; there shall not be male or female barren among you or among your cattle. And Jehovah will take away from thee every disease, and all the evil sicknesses of Egypt which thou knowest he will not lay upon thee, but will put them upon all that hate thee. And thou shalt consume all the peoples that Jehovah thy God shall deliver to thee; thine eye shall not spare them (Deut. 7:12–16). Things spiritual, thus spiritual blessings, are meant by all this; these things are what are involved in and signified by the sense of the letter, which is natural, and is for those who are in the natural world, and therefore in natural ideas; consequently from the spiritual sense of the Word what is meant in general and in particular by “being blessed” can be seen. The “fruit of the belly, and the fruit of the ground, the corn, the new wine, and oil, the young of the kine and of the rams of the flock,” mean the multiplications of truth and the fructifications of good, thus spiritual blessings. (What is signified specifically by each can be seen in various places in Arcana Coelestia, and in the explanation of this prophetic book.) “There shall not be male or female barren among you or among your cattle” signifies the multiplication of truth and the fructification of good in the internal and the external man; “and Jehovah will take away every disease, and all the evil sicknesses of Egypt” signifies the removal of all evils and falsities, “the evil sicknesses of Egypt” meaning falsities arising from evils in the natural man. “Those that hate thee upon whom Jehovah will put these,” are those who are against the truths and goods of the church. The dispersion of the evils and falsities that are against the truths and goods of the church, is signified by “thou shalt consume all the peoples that Jehovah thy God shall deliver to thee”; and continual shunning of them is meant by “thine eye shall not spare"

In that day shall Israel be a third to Egypt and to Assyria, a blessing in the midst of the land; whom Jehovah shall bless, saying, Blessed be Egypt my people, and Assyria the work of my hands, and Israel mine inheritance (Isa. 19:23–25). “Israel, Assyria, and Egypt” signify the three faculties belonging to the men of the church, namely, the spiritual, the rational, and the knowing; “Israel” the spiritual, “Assyria” the rational, and “Egypt” the knowing. Because all man’s rational is formed by means of knowledges [scientifica], and both the rational and knowing faculties are from the spiritual, which is from the Lord out of heaven (for from that source is all understanding of truth and all application of knowledges [scientiarum] to truths), it is said, “there shall be a highway out of Egypt into Assyria, that Assyria may come into Egypt and Egypt into Assyria, and that the Egyptians may serve with Assyria”; and again, “Israel shall be a third to Egypt and to Assyria, a blessing in the midst of the land.” The “midst” signifies the inmost from which is the rest, that is, from which is the whole (see above, n. 313); and the “land” is the church where these things are. And as it is the spiritual by which the rational and knowing faculties are applied to genuine truths, Israel is called the “inheritance,” that is, the heir of the house who possesses all things; and Assyria is called “the work of my hands,” because the rational is formed from the spiritual; and Egypt is called “a blessed people,” because in the knowing faculty, as in their ultimate, all things are together. From this also it is clear that “blessing” in the Word means spiritual blessing.

It should be known, that in the spiritual world, where spirits and angels are, all things have the same appearance as in the natural world where men are, namely, there are mountains, hills, lands, and seas (see above, n. 304a). The angels who are in the third or inmost heaven dwell upon the mountains, those who are in the second or middle heaven dwell upon the hills, and those who are in the first or lowest heaven dwell upon the earth and under the earth, and in the seas. But the seas in which the lowest of that heaven dwell are not like the seas in which the evil dwell; their waters are different. The waters of the seas in which the well- disposed in the lowest heaven dwell are rare and pure; but the waters of the seas in which the evil dwell are gross and impure; thus they are entirely different seas. [4] These seas I have several times been permitted to see, and also to converse with those who are in them; and it was found that those were there who had been in the world merely sensual, and yet well-disposed; and because they were sensual they were unable to understand what the spiritual is, but only what the natural is; nor could they apprehend the Word and the doctrine of the church from the Word except sensually. All these appear to be as if in a sea; but those who are in it do not seem to themselves to be in a sea, but as it were in an atmosphere like that in which they had lived while in the world; they appear to be in a sea only to those who are above them. At this day there is an immense number there, because so many at this day are sensual. This lowest part of heaven corresponds to the soles of the feet. This is the reason why seas are so often mentioned in the Word, and also fishes therein, “seas” there signifying the generals of truth which belong to the natural man, and “fishes” the sensual knowledges, which are the lowest"

From this it can be known what is meant by “every created thing that is in the heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and those that are in the sea, and all that are in them.” [5] Like things are signified in the following passages by “seas,” and by the things that are in them, which are called “fishes” and “whales.” In David: Let heaven and earth praise Jehovah, the seas, and every thing that creepeth therein. For God will save Zion, and will build the cities of Judah (Ps. 69:34–35). It is said also “every thing that creepeth therein,” meaning those who are sensual. “Zion, which God will save,” and “the cities of Judah, which he will build,” mean the celestial church and its doctrine, “Zion” that church, and “cities” the doctrine. There is a like meaning in these words in David: Praise Jehovah from the earth, ye whales and all deeps (Ps. 148:7); “whales” meaning the same. For this reason Egypt also is called a “whale” (Ezek. 29:3); for “Egypt” signifies the knowing faculty in the natural man, and “whale” knowing in general. [6] These things have a like signification also elsewhere in the same: Thou madest him to rule over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all things under his feet; the flock and all herds, and also the beasts of the field, the bird of heaven, and the fishes of the sea (Ps. 8:6–8).

Who knoweth not from all these that the hand of Jehovah doeth this? (Job 12:7–10). [7] In Ezekiel: The angel brought me back unto the entrance of the house; where behold, waters went out from under the threshold of the house towards the east. Then he said unto me, These waters go out toward the eastern border, and go down into the plain, and come towards the sea; they are sent forth into the sea that the waters may be healed; whence it cometh to pass that every living soul that creepeth, whithersoever the brooks come, shall live; whence it is that there are exceeding many fish, because these waters come thither, and they are healed, that everything may live whither the brook cometh. According to their kind shall the fish be, as the fish of the great sea, exceeding many. The miry places thereof and the marshes thereof are not healed; they are given to the salt (Ezek. 47:1, 8–11). “The waters going out from under the threshold of the house towards the east” signify truths from a celestial origin, “waters” meaning truths, “the east” the good of heavenly love, and “house” heaven and the church; the “plain into which the waters go down,” and “the sea into which they come” signify the ultimates of heaven and the church, consequently those who are in ultimates (of whom above), namely, those who are only in the knowledges of truth from the outmost sense of the Word, and apprehend those knowledges naturally and sensually. When such are in simple good, they receive the influx of the higher heavens, whence it is that they also receive in their knowledges what is spiritual, and thus some spiritual life. This is meant by “the waters are sent forth into the sea, that the waters may be healed; whence it cometh to pass that every living soul that creepeth, whithersoever the brooks come, shall live”; likewise by these words, “whence it cometh that there are exceeding many fish, because these waters come thither, and"

[8] Like things are signified by “sea,” and by “fishes of the sea,” in Isaiah: Behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers into a wilderness; their fish stinketh because there is no water, and dieth of thirst (Isa. 50:2). “Rebuke” signifies the desolation of all truth; “sea” signifies where truth is in its outmost; “water” signifies truth from a spiritual origin; “to die for thirst” signifies desolation from lack of that truth; “fishes of the sea” signify those who are in the ultimates of truth, in whom there is no life from a spiritual origin. [9] “Fishes of the sea” have a like signification in Ezekiel: In my zeal, in the fire of my fury I will speak; that the fishes of the sea, and the fowl of the heavens, and the wild beast of the field, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the ground may quake before me (Ezek. 38:19–20). In Hosea: They commit robbery, and bloods touch bloods; therefore the land shall mourn, and everyone that dwelleth therein shall languish; as to the wild beast of the field, and as to the fowl of the heavens, and also the fishes of the sea shall be gathered together (Hos. 4:2–3).

[10] This significance of “sea” and “fishes” comes from the appearance in the spiritual world; all societies there appear surrounded by an atmosphere corresponding to their affections and thoughts; those in the third heaven appear in an atmosphere pure as the ethereal atmosphere; those in the second heaven appear in an atmosphere less pure, like the aerial; while the societies in the lowest part of heaven appear surrounded by an atmosphere, as it were watery; but those in the hells appear surrounded by gross and impure atmospheres, some of them as if in black waters, and others in other ways. It is the affections and the thoughts therefrom that produce these appearances around them; for spheres are exhaled from all, and these spheres are changed into such appearances. (Of these spheres, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 2489, 4464, 5179, 7454, 8630.) It is also from the appearance in the spiritual world that those who are in spiritual affection and in thought therefrom are signified by “the birds of heaven,” and those who are in natural affection and in thought therefrom by “fishes”; for both birds and fishes appear there, birds over the lands, and fishes in the seas. The affections and consequent thoughts of those who are there are what so appear; this is known to all who are in that world; and both the birds and the fishes have been many times seen by me; this appearance is from correspondence. From this it can be seen why “seas” signify the generals of truth, and “whales” and “fishes” the affections and thoughts of those who are in the generals of truth. That “seas” signify the generals of truth has been shown above (n. 275).

Because these things are spiritual, and above the sense of the letter, they are not willing and are scarcely able to perceive them because they see all things naturally and sensually. [12] For this reason, from these words in Revelation: I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away (Rev. 21:1). It has been understood heretofore that the visible heaven and the habitable earth were to perish, and that a new heaven and a new earth were to arise. That “heaven” here means the heaven where angels are, and “earth” means the church where men are, and that these are to become new, those who think merely naturally and sensually are not willing to admit, and therefore do not understand; for they do not suffer their mind to be elevated out of the natural light into spiritual light. With such this is difficult, so much so that they can hardly bear that the Word should have any meaning beyond what the letter in its own sense declares and the natural man apprehends. Such persons are not unlike those birds that see and sing in dark places, but in the light of day blink with their eyes and see but little. The good among such are like these birds, and also like flying fishes; but the evil of this class are like night owls and horned owls, which altogether shun the light of day, or like fishes that cannot be elevated into the air without loss of life. The reason is that with the good of this class the internal spiritual man receives some little spiritual influx from heaven, consequently some perception that a thing is so although they do not see it; while with the evil of this class the internal spiritual man is entirely closed up.

This is evident from what has been said and shown above (n. 297), namely, that “throne” signifies heaven; “him that sitteth upon the throne” Divine good proceeding, and “the lamb” Divine truth proceeding, both of these filling the heavens and constituting them. Because Divine good proceeding from the Lord as a sun is received by the angels in his celestial kingdom, and Divine truth by the angels in the spiritual kingdom, therefore two are mentioned, namely, “He that sitteth upon the throne” and “the lamb”; but in the internal sense, the two mean the Divine proceeding from the Lord’s Divine human, which is Divine good united to Divine truth, while in the sense of the letter it is distinguished into two for the sake of reception. The Divine that constitutes heaven and gives to angels and men love, faith, wisdom, and intelligence, proceeds not immediately from the Lord’s Divine itself, but through his Divine human, and this Divine that proceeds is the Holy Spirit (see above, n. 183). [2] In this way it is to be understood what the doctrine of the church teaches, that the son proceeds from the Father, and the Holy Spirit through the son, also that the Lord’s Divine and his human are not two, but a single person or one Christ; for the Lord’s Divine is that which assumed the human, and for that reason he called it his Father; thus he did not call Father another Divine which is at this day worshiped as his Father in place of his own Divine. And the Divine proceeding is what is called the Holy Spirit, the spirit of God, the spirit of truth, and the paraclete; since this is the holy of the spirit, or the holy Divine which the spirit speaks, and not another Divine, which is worshiped as the third person of the divinity.

Athanasius, because he did not understand this, believed the three names to be three Gods, though one in essence. [3] And yet they cannot be said to be one in essence when something is attributed to one and not to another, for thus the essence is divided; consequently a personal name is given to each essence. But they are one essence when the three are names of one person, namely, the Divine itself, called the Father; the Divine human, called the son; and the Divine proceeding, called the Holy Spirit (see the Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, n. 280–310). These things have been said to show that “He that sitteth upon the throne,” and “the lamb,” do not mean two but one, namely, the Lord in respect to the Divine proceeding. 344.

And as “honor and glory” signify, when said of the Lord, Divine good and Divine truth, so when said of man they signify every good of love and truth of faith, from which are all the wisdom and intelligence that angels and men have.

For all who are of the church know, because it is according to doctrine, that every good and truth is from God; and those who live a good life retain and believe this without investigating how it comes; for this reason these also are in heaven, although in its lowest part.

This is evident from the signification of “might,” as being, in reference to the Lord, omnipotence; and as the Lord has omnipotence from Divine good by means of Divine truth, therefore it is said, “the honor and the glory and the might”; for “honor and glory” signify Divine good and Divine truth.

From this it is clear that “the four animals said, amen” signifies confirmation from the Lord out of the inmost heaven. The things that have thus far been said by the angels of the three heavens were confirmed by the Lord, because everything they said was from the Lord, not from themselves; for it was the acknowledgment of his Divine in the human, a glorification on that account, and a thanksgiving that all good and truth and therefore all wisdom and intelligence are from him; these things the angels could not say from themselves, but from the Lord by interior dictate or influx; for the angels, like men, cannot from themselves even name the Lord, consequently they cannot from themselves acknowledge and glorify him; for this reason the things they said were confirmed from the Lord by “amen,” which signifies the truth of faith, and faith itself. Moreover, it is according to Divine order for the Lord to confirm the truths that an angel or a man speaks as if from himself, though not from himself; these he confirms in their hearts by an assurance not ascending manifestly into their thought, yet by a full acquiescence of mind proceeding from internal affection, which is from peace and its delight. This is the confirmation that it meant in the genuine internal sense by this manifest announcement heard by John. 349a.

The opinion that life is in man in such a way as to be his own is merely an appearance that springs from the perpetual presence of the Lord, and from his Divine love, in that he wills to be conjoined to man, to be in him, and to impart to him his life, for such is the Divine love; and because this is perpetual and continuous man supposes that life is in him as his own; yet it is known that there is not a good or a truth in man, but that they come from above, thus that they flow in. It is the same with love and faith; for everything of man’s love is from good, and everything of his faith is from truth; for what a man loves is good to him, and what he believes is truth to him. This makes clear in the first place that no good and no truth, so neither love nor faith, is in man, but that they flow in from the Lord. Life itself is in good and truth, and nowhere else. The receptacle of the good of love with man is the will, and the receptacle of the truth of faith with him is the understanding; and to will good does not belong to man, nor to believe truth. These are the two faculties in which is the whole life of man; outside of these there is no life. This also makes clear that the life of these faculties, and accordingly the life of the whole man, is not in man but flows in. It is also by influx that evil and falsity, or the will and love of evil and the understanding and faith of falsity, are with man; but this influx is from hell. For man is kept in the freedom of choosing, that is, of receiving good and truth from the Lord or of receiving evil and falsity from hell, and man is kept in this for the sake of reformation, for he is kept between heaven and hell, and thence in spiritual equilibrium, which is freedom. Neither is this freedom itself in the man, but it is together with the life that flows in.

It is the same as when man’s thought and will act upon members distorted from birth, or upon injured organs of sensation; and as when the light of heaven flows into objects that vary in their colors, and as when the heat of heaven flows into the same, which vary in their odors according to their interior receptive forms. But it should be known that the life itself is not changed and varied, but the life produces an appearance of the recipient form by which and from which the life is transmitted; much as by the same light different persons appear in a mirror each such as he is. [4] Moreover, all the senses of man, namely, sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch, are none of them in man, but are excited and produced from influx; in man there are only the organic recipient forms, in these there is no sense until what is adapted thereto from without flows in. The like is true of the internal organs of sensation which belong to thought and affection and receive influx from the spiritual world, as of the external organs of sensation which receive influx from the natural world. That there is one only fountain of life, and that all life is therefrom and flows in continually, is well known in heaven, and is never called in question by any angel in the higher heavens, for these perceive the influx itself. That all lives are streams, as it were, from the only and perennial fountain of life, has been testified to me also from much experience, and seen in the spiritual world with those who believed that they lived from themselves, and were not willing to believe that they lived from the Lord. When influx into the thought was in some part withheld from these, they lay as if deprived of life, but as soon as the influx reached them, they as it were revived from death; and then the same confessed that the life in them is not theirs, but continually flows into them, and that men, spirits, and angels are only forms receptive of life. [5] That this is so the wise there conclude from this: that nothing can exist and subsist from itself but only from what is prior to itself, so neither can what is prior exist and subsist from itself but only in successive order from a first; and thus life itself, regarded in itself, is only from him who alone is life in himself.

The Divine good that proceeds from the Lord is that from which order comes, and the Divine truths are the laws of order (as may be seen in the Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, n. 279). [6] Everyone should guard against the belief that the Divine life with anyone, even with the evil and in hell, is changed; for, as was said above, the life itself is not changed or varied, but the life produces an appearance of the recipient form, through which and from which the life is transmitted; much as everyone appears in a mirror such as he is through the light, the light remaining unchanged, and simply presenting the form to the sight; and just as the same life presents itself to be perceived according to the form of the bodily organ, thus after one manner in the eye, after another manner in the hearing, and otherwise in the smell, taste, and touch. The belief that life is varied and changed is from an appearance, which is a fallacy like the fallacy from the appearance that influx is physical, when yet influx is spiritual.

As the Father hath life in himself, so hath he given to the son to have life in himself (John 5:21, 26). “Father” here means the Lord’s Divine itself, which took on the human, for this Divine was in him from conception, and because he was conceived from this, he called it, and no other, “Father.” The “son” means the Lord’s Divine human; that this, in like manner, is life itself, the Lord teaches in express words, saying, “as the Father maketh to live, the son also maketh whom he will to live”; and “as the Father hath life in himself, so hath he given to the son to have life in himself.” “To have life in himself” is to be life itself; the others are not life, but they have life from that life. [8] In the same: I am the way, the truth, and the life; no one cometh unto the Father but through me (John 14:6). “I am the way, the truth, and the life,” was said of the Lord’s human; for he also says, “no one comes unto the Father but through me,” his “Father” being the Divine in him, which was his own Divine. This makes clear that the Lord also, in respect to his human, is life, consequently that his human also in like manner is Divine. [9] In the same:"

Everyone that liveth and believeth in me shall not die forever (John 11:25–26). This, too, the Lord said of his human; and as he is life itself, and all have life from him, and those who believe in him have life eternal, therefore he says that he is “the resurrection and the life,” and “he that believeth in me shall not die forever”; “to believe in the Lord” signifies to be conjoined to him in love and faith, and “not to die” signifies not to die spiritually, that is, not to be damned, for the life of the damned is called “death.” [10] In the same: In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and God was the Word. In him was life; and the life was the light of men. And the Word became flesh, and dwelt in us (John 1:1, 4, 14). It is known that “the Word” means the Lord; his human is evidently the Word, for it is said, “the Word became flesh, and dwelt in us”; and that his human was equally Divine with the Divine itself that took on the human is evident from this, that a distinction is made between them, and that each is called God, for it is said, “the Word was with God, and God was the Word,” and “in him was life.” That all live from him is meant by “the life was the light of men”; “the light of men” is the life of their thought and understanding; for the Divine proceeding, which is specially meant by “the Word,” appears in heaven as the light which enables angels not only to see, but also to think and understand, and according to its reception to be wise (see Heaven and Hell, n. 126–140). This light proceeding from the Lord is life itself, which not only enlightens the understanding, as the sun of the world does the eye, but also vivifies it according to reception; and when this light is received in the life, it is called “the light of life” in the same: Jesus said, I am the light of the world; he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life (John 8:12).

I am the bread of life (John 6:33, 35, 47–48, 51). “The bread of God” and “the bread of life” is that from which all have life. Since the life that is called intelligence and wisdom is from the Lord, it follows also that life in general is from him; for the particular things of life, which make its perfection and which are insinuated into man according to reception, all belong to the general life. This life is perfected to the extent that the evils into which man is born are removed from it. 349c. [12] That those who are conjoined to the Lord by means of love and faith receive eternal life, that is, the life of heaven, which is salvation, is evident from the following passages. In John: I am the vine, and ye are the branches; he that abideth in me, and I in him, the same beareth much fruit; for without me ye cannot do anything. If a man abide not in me he is cast forth, and as a branch he withereth (John 15:5–6). Everyone who believeth in me hath eternal life (John 3:14–16). He that believeth on the son hath eternal life; but he that believeth not the son shall not see life, but the anger of God abideth on him (John 3:36). Whoever believeth on the son hath eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day (John 6:40, 47–48, 54). The sheep follow me; and I give unto them eternal life; and they shall not perish forever (John 10:27–28). Search the Scriptures, they bear witness of me: but ye will not come unto me, that ye may have life (John 5:39–40). “To believe in God” and “to believe the things that are from God” are mentioned in the Word; and “to believe in God” is the faith that saves, but “to believe the things that are from God” is historical faith, which without the former does not save, and therefore is not true faith; for “to believe in God” is to know, to"

Verse 1. And I saw, signifies the manifestation of the states of those who are of the church where the Word is. This is evident from the things that John saw, which are described in this chapter and in what follows, as being the manifestations of the state of those who are in the church, where the Word is; for there is here treated “the opening of the seals of the book” that was in the Lord’s hand, and what was then seen, namely, “four horses, one white, another red, the third black, and the fourth pale,” and afterwards “the souls of those that were slain for the Word of God,” also “an earthquake,” and finally “seven angels who had seven trumpets.” All these things signify the manifestations of the state of those who are of the church, as can be seen from the particulars viewed in the internal sense. It is said, the church where the Word is, because the Lord’s church is in the whole world, but in a special sense where the Word is, and where the Lord is known through the Word. The state of those who are of this church is especially treated of in this prophetic book, here in general, but afterwards particularly. This church is especially treated of because the Lord, and thus the angels of heaven, are present with the men of this earth by means of the Word; for the Word is written by pure correspondences; from this it comes that the Lord and the angels of heaven are present also with those who are around or outside the church, who are called Gentiles [nations] (as can be seen from the things mentioned and shown in the work on Heaven and Hell, on the conjunction of heaven with the man of the church by means of the Word n. 114, 303–310; and in the Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, n. 244, 246, 255–266). [2] For the church in the whole world is before the Lord as One Man, for it makes a one with the angelic heaven. (That it is before the Lord as one man, see in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 59–102.)

The light of heaven, or the light in which are the angels of heaven who are from this earth, is from the Lord by means of the Word; from this as from a center light is diffused into the circumferences in every direction, thus to those who are there, who, as was said, are the Gentiles that are outside of our church. But this diffusion of light is effected in heaven by the Lord, and what is done in heaven flows also into the minds of men, for the minds of men make one with the minds of spirits and angels. It is for this reason that those are especially treated of in this prophetical book who are of the church where the Word is; then those also are treated of who are of the church where the Word is not, although not proximately, for the arrangement of those who are in the circumferences follows according to the order in which those are who are in the center. 352. When the Lamb had opened the first of the seals, signifies the first manifestation from the Lord. This is evident from the signification of “to open a seal,” as being to reveal the things hidden which are written within; for when a seal is opened the things enclosed are read, here the hidden things that no one except the Lord alone could know, for they are the states of all in general and in particular. That no one except the Lord alone knows these states is evident from what has been explained above respecting this book and the opening of its seals (n. 199, 222a, 299, 327). From this it is clear that “when the Lamb had opened the first of the seals,” signifies the first manifestation from the Lord. 353. And I heard one of the four animals saying as with the voice of thunder, signifies out of the inmost heaven from the Lord.

That “lightnings,” “thunders,” and “voices,” in the Word, signify illustration, understanding and perception, see above (n. (273), thence also manifestation. That “thunders” signify the manifestation from the inmost heaven is from correspondence; for the voices that come down out of that heaven even into the hearing of man are heard no otherwise, for they fill the whole cerebrum and extend themselves therefrom towards the hearing, and are there perceived as a sound of thunder. It is other wise with the voices that come down from the middle heaven; for as these flow in with illustration, they are heard only sonorously like words of speech. [2] The reason of this is that the things that come down out of the inmost or third heaven enter the will of man, and the will expresses itself in sounds; but the things that come down out of the middle of second heaven enter into the intellect of man, and the intellect expresses itself in articulations of sound; for sounds take form in the understanding, and sounds so formed, which are called articulations of sound, present themselves in the thought through ideas, and in the hearing through words. Those things, therefore, that come down out of the inmost or third heaven correspond to thunder, and those out of the middle or second heaven to lightning; and consequently in the Word “lightnings” and “thunders” signify illustration, understanding, and perception. There is something like this in the case of sounds in the world, which grow with an increase as they come down from heights, as from high mountains into valleys, and also from the clouds towards the earth, from which are thunders; so also the voices out of the third or highest heaven, when they roll on towards the lower parts and at length reach the lowest, in which is human hearing, are heard as thunders, but only by those whose interiors are opened, as John’s were at this time. 354.

It is evident also front the signification of “to see,” as being perception, for “to see” in the Word signifies to understand (see above, n. 11, 260); here it signifies to perceive, because this was out of the inmost heaven, since what comes out of the inmost heaven is perceived, but what comes out of the middle heaven is understood, for the reason that the inmost heaven is in the good of love, but the middle heaven is in the truths therefrom, and all perception is from good, and all understanding is from truths. (On this see above, n. 307; what perception is, see in the Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, n. 140.) 355a. Verse 2. And I saw, and behold a white horse, signifies the understanding of truth from the Word. This is evident from the signification of “horse,” as being the intellect; and from the signification of “white,” which is predicated of truth. (That the “horse” signifies the intellect can be seen from what is quoted and shown in the small work on The White Horse; and that “white” is predicated of truth, see above, n. 196.) It is said that a “a white horse” was seen when the Lamb opened the first seal, “a red horse” when He opened the second, “a black horse” when He opened the third, and “a pale horse” when He opened the fourth; and as “horse” signifies the intellect, particularly in relation to the Word, it can be seen thence that the understanding of truth from the Word, and its quality with the men of the church, are here described by “horses.” It is the same whether you say that the understanding of truth is described, or those who are in it are described; for men, spirits, and angels are the subjects in which it resides. From this it can be known what is described in the internal or spiritual sense in this chapter and in those that follow next, namely, the Word in relation to the understanding. This is evident also from the ninth verse of this chapter, where, after these four horses had appeared, and the fifth seal had been opened, it is said,” I saw the souls of them that had been slain for the Word of God;” also from the nineteenth chapter of this book, where it is said that:"

[2] In Ezekiel: Gather yourselves from the circuit to My sacrifice that I do sacrifice for you. Ye shall be satisfied at My table with horse and with chariot, with the mighty man, and with every man of war. So will I give My glory among the nations (39:17, 20, 21). This treats of the calling together of all to the Lord’s kingdom, and especially of the establishment of the church with the Gentiles; for it describes the spiritual captivity in which the Gentiles were, and their liberation from it. “The sacrifice to be sacrificed” signifies all the worship by which the Lord is worshiped; “to be satiated at My table” signifies with all spiritual food; and as this food is the understanding of truth from the Word and from doctrine from the Word, it is said, “with horse and with chariot,” “horse” signifying the understanding of truth from the Word, and “chariot” signifying the doctrine therefrom. It is also said, “with the mighty man, and with every man of war,” “mighty man” signifying the truth from good that destroys evil, and “man of war” the truth from good that destroys falsity. Unless such things were signified, how could it be said that they should be satiated “with horse and with chariot, with the mighty man, and with every man of war?” [3] Likewise in Revelation: Gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great God; that ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of commanders of thousands, and the flesh of the strong ones, and the flesh of horses, and of them that sit on them (19:17, 18)."

It must be clear to everyone that this does not mean the flesh of kings, of commanders of thousands, of strong ones, of horses, and of them that sit on them. [4] In Habakkuk.

Who does not see that “horses” here do not mean horses? For it is said of Jehovah that “He rideth upon His horses,” and that “He treadeth down the sea with His horses,” and that “His chariots are salvation?” But this is said because “His riding upon horses” signifies that Jehovah, that is, the Lord, is in the understanding of His Word in its spiritual sense; and since the doctrine of truth, which teaches the way of salvation, is from the Word, it is added, “Thy chariots are salvation,” “chariots” signifying doctrine; also “to tread down the sea with horses” signifies that Jehovah, that is, the Lord, is in the understanding of His Word in its natural sense; for “sea” here signifies that sense, and in general all things of the natural man and that are for the natural man; and because Divine truths there are in their ultimate, it is added, “the mire [or clay] of many waters,” “mire” [or “clay”] signifying the ultimate from which and in which are truths, and “waters” signifying truths.

That there would then be nothing of the church remaining with the Jews is described by, “I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem, and the bow of war shall be cut off,” which signifies that there would no longer be any truth in doctrine nor any understanding of truth; and thence no combat and resistance against falsity; “Ephraim” signifies the church in relation to the understanding of truth, and “Jerusalem” the church in relation to the doctrine of truth, “the chariot” doctrine itself, and “the horse” the understanding itself, and “the bow of war” combat and resistance against falsity.

The devastation of the former church is described by “In that day I will smite every horse with astonishment, and the horseman with madness; and every horse of the peoples will I smite with blindness.” It is plain that “horse” here signifies the understanding of truth with the men of the church, and “horseman” the affection of spiritual truth, from which is understanding; else why should it be said that “the horse should be smitten with astonishment, and the horse of the peoples with"

[7] In the same: In that day there shall be upon the bells of the horses, Holiness to Jehovah (14:20). This also treats of the Lord’s coming, and the invitation of all to the church; and “the bells of the horses” signify knowledges and cognitions (scientifica et cognitiones) and preachings therefrom which are from the understanding of truth; and as all understanding of truth is from the Lord, and thus the knowledges and preachings themselves, therefore it is said, “there shall be upon the bells of the horses, Holiness to Jehovah.” Because “bells” have this signification: There were bells of gold upon the skirts of Aaron’s robe round about (Exod. 28:34, 35). 355b.

From this it can now be seen what is signified by “the black horses went forth to the land of the north, and the white went forth after them,” and “they have caused My spirit to rest in the land of the north,” namely, that those who from good of life are in the affection of knowing the truths of the church receive and understand, nor are any others illustrated; that such are illustrated and receive is meant by “they have caused My spirit to rest in the land of the north;” “the grisled went forth into land of the south, and the stout to wander through the earth,” signifies that those who from the good of life are in the affection of knowing the truths of the church come into the light, and that they resist evils and falsities, and constitute the church. These four kinds of horses, therefore, are called “the four winds of the heavens, going forth from standing by the Lord of the whole earth;” “winds” signifying all Divine truths, and “going forth from standing by the Lord of the whole earth” signifying that all truths proceed from Him. (That “winds” signify all Divine truths, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 9642, and in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 141–153; and that “to go forth” signifies to proceed, Arcana Coelestia, n. 5337, 7124, 9303.) “They that are afar, that shall build in the temple of Jehovah,” signify those who were previously far away from the truths and goods of the church, who shall draw near to the church. (That such are signified by “those that are afar,” see Arcana Coelestia, 4723, 8918; and that the “temple of Jehovah” signifies the church, n. 3720; moreover, that “the north” signifies the obscurity of truth, and “the south (auster sive meridies)” the clearness of truth, thus also those that are in obscurity and in clearness of truth, see in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 148–151.)

These things are said of a “bird,” which signifies intelligence from self (proprium), which in itself is no intelligence; for man from self (proprium) sees nothing but falsities and not truths, and intelligence is from truths, and not from falsities; therefore it is said of her, “God hath made her to forget wisdom, neither hath He imparted to her intelligence,” and “when she lifteth up herself on high she laugheth at the horse and its rider,” that is, at the understanding of truth, and at him who is intelligent. 355c.

They of Bethogarma gave for thy wares horses, horsemen, and mules (27:13, 14). This treats of Tyre, which signifies the knowledges of truth and good pertaining to the external and the internal church. “Javan, Tubal, and Meshech,” signify those who are in external worship; and “they of Bethogarma,” those who are in internal worship; it is said therefore that these “gave for the wares of Tyre, horses, horsemen, and mules;” and “the others gave the soul of man and vessels of brass;” the “soul of man” signifies the truth of faith in respect to knowledge; “vessels of brass” signify the truths of natural good; and “horses, horsemen, and mules,” signify the understanding of truth and good, “horses” the understanding of truth, “horsemen” intelligence, and “mules” the rational. (That “mule” signifies the rational, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 2781, 5741, 9212.) Everyone can see that “the tradings of Tyre,” which are enumerated in this chapter and elsewhere, do not mean tradings with these things, such as vessels of brass, horses, and mules, and many others; but that spiritual tradings are meant, which are effected by means of the knowledges of truth and good; for the Word is Divine, and treats of Divine things, and not of earthly things; therefore it contains spiritual things which pertain to heaven and the church, expressed in the ultimate sense, which is the sense of the letter, by natural things which correspond to them. (That “to trade” and “to be a merchant” signifies in the Word to acquire and to communicate the knowledges of truth and good, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 2967, 4453; and that “to buy” and “to sell” signify something similar, n. 2967, 4397, 4453, 5371, 5374, 5406, 5410, 5426, 5886, 6143, 7999, 9039.)

These are compared to “a horse in the wilderness,” and to “a beast in the valley,” because “horse” signifies the understanding of truth, and “beast” the affection of good; for all comparisons in the Word are from correspondences. [14] In Revelation: I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and He that sat upon him was called the Word of God. And the armies that are in heaven followed Him upon white horses (19:11–16). “A white horse” evidently signifies the understanding of the Word, likewise “the white horses” upon which those sat who followed; for “He that sat upon” the white horse was the Lord in relation to the Word; for it is said, “and He that sat upon him was called the Word of God;” and in verse 16, “He had upon His vesture and upon His thigh a name written, Lord of lords and King of kings.” The Lord is called the Word, because the Word means Divine truth proceeding from Him. (But these things in Revelation may be seen more fully explained in the small work on The White Horse, n. 1; also why the Lord is called “the Word,” n. 14.) As “chariots” and “horses” signify doctrine from the Word and the understanding of it, and as all doctrine of truth and the understanding of it are out of heaven from the Lord, therefore it is said of Him that “He rides upon the Word,” “upon the clouds,” “upon heaven,” “upon a cherub,” also that “He makes to ride,” as in the following passages. In David: Gird thy sword upon the thigh, O mighty One, in Thy majesty, and in Thine honor mount, and ride upon the Word of truth and the meekness of righteousness (Ps. 45:3, 4). These things are said of the Lord. In the same: Sing unto God, sing psalms to His name; extol Him that rideth upon the clouds (Ps. 68:4)."

This treats of the establishment of a new church by the Lord; it is not meant therefore that they will bring their brethren upon horses, upon the chariot, upon covered wagons, upon mules, and upon swift beasts, to Jerusalem; but it is meant that all who are in good are to be instructed in Divine truths, and having been made intelligent and wise thereby are to be introduced into the church; for “brethren” signify all who are in good; “horses” signify the understanding of truth; “chariot” the doctrine of truth; “covered wagons” the knowledges of truth; “mules” the internal rational, which is spiritual; and “swift beasts” the external rational, which is natural; and “Jerusalem” signifies the church, in which is the doctrine of Divine truth, which is called “the mountain of holiness” from the love of truth. From the signification of “chariots” and “horses” it can be seen why: Elijah and Elisha were called the chariots of Israel and the horsemen thereof, and the mountain was seen by the lad of Elisha to be full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha (2 Kings 2:11, 12; 6:17; 13:14); namely, that both Elijah and Elisha represented the Lord in relation to the Word, and “chariots” signify doctrine from the Word, and “horsemen” intelligence.

With the hoofs of his horses shall he trample all thy streets; be shall slay the people with the sword (26:7, 8, 10, 11). “Tyre” signifies the church in relation to the knowledges of truth; and “the king of Babylon” the destruction of truth by falsities and profanation; “the north from which he was to come” signifies the source of all falsity, in particular, hell, out of which falsity arises; “chariot,” “horses,” and “horsemen” signify the doctrine of falsity and reasonings therefrom; “the daughters whom they shall slay in the field with the sword” signify the affections of truth which falsities will destroy, for “daughters” are the affections of truth, “the field is the church where those affections are, “the sword” is the combat of falsity against truth, and “to slay” is to extinguish. This makes clear the signification of “by reason of the abundance of his horses their dust shall cover thee,” “dust” meaning the evil of falsity; the “walls that shall quake by reason of the voice of the horseman, of the wheel, and of the chariot,” signify protecting truths, which in general are, that there is a God, and that the Word is Divine, and that there is eternal life. These “walls,” or these truths, are said “to quake by reason of the voice of the horseman, of the wheel, and of the chariot,” when they come to be doubted through the falsities of doctrines and reasonings from them; “the hoofs of the horses with which he shall trample all the streets,” signify the outermost things of the natural man, which are called sensual impressions (sensualia), from which are all falsities; the “streets that shall be trampled by them” are the truths of the doctrine of the church, which are wholly destroyed; the “people who shall fall by the sword” signify all who are in truths, and in an abstract sense all truths.

This chapter treats of the combat of the king of the north with the king of the south; and “the king of the north” means falsity from evil, and “the king of the south” truth from good; so evidently the things mentioned in this chapter are not spoken of any future war between two kings, but of the combats of falsity from evil against truth from good. “The chariot and horsemen with which the king of the north shall rush upon him” are the assaults upon truth by the falsities of evil; the “many ships,” with which also they shall rush upon him, are the knowledges (scientifica) and doctrinals of falsity; the destruction of the church thereby is signified by “he shall come into the lands and shall overflow and pass through.” (That “ships” signify knowledges and doctrinals, in both senses, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 1977, 6385; and that “to overflow” signifies immersion in falsities and evils, n. 660, 705, 739, 756, 790, 5725, 6853.) 355e.

Their lust for and dexterity in perverting truths and destroying them by reasonings from falsities altogether remote from truths are signified by, “her horses are lighter than leopards, and more fierce than the wolves of the evening, so that her horsemen spread themselves; yea, her horsemen shall come from far; they shall fly as an eagle that hasteth to eat.” Lust is signified by “her horses are lighter than leopards,” and dexterity by “her horses are more fierce than the wolves of the evening,” and both by “they fly as an eagle.” Because the lust and dexterity are for destroying truths therefore it is said, “she shall come wholly for violence;” their scoffing at truths and goods is signified by “she shall mock at kings, and rulers shall be a derision unto her,” “kings” signifying truths, and “lords” and “rulers” goods.

And they shall be as mighty men treading down the mire of the streets; and they shall fight because Jehovah is with them, and they shall make ashamed them that ride upon horses (10:3–5). “The house of Judah” signifies the Lord’s celestial kingdom, that is, the heaven and church that are in love to the Lord; of this it is said that it shall be “as the horse of majesty in war,” which signifies the understanding of Divine truth combating against evils and falsities, which it will destroy, “horse” signifying the understanding, “majesty” Divine truth, and “war” combat against falsities and evils and their destruction. “The corner,” “the nail,” and “the bow of war,” that are “out of Judah,” signify truths, “the corner” truth protecting, “the nail” truth strengthening, and the “bow of war” truth combating from doctrine; “they shall be as mighty men treading down the mire of the streets” signifies the power to disperse and destroy falsities, “mire of the streets” signifying falsities. “They shall make ashamed them that ride upon horses” signifies the annihilation of the reasonings, argumentations, and confirmations that are from man’s own understanding; that this shall be accomplished by the Lord and not by them is meant by, “they shall fight because Jehovah is with them.” [29] In Hosea:"

This also treats of intelligence from self, that it will not save. “Asshur” signifies the rational, here as being from self; “to ride upon the horse” signifies reasoning of the understanding from self; and “work of the hands” signifies the selfhood [proprium]) itself. [30] In Ezekiel: Oholah committed whoredom, and she doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians her neighbors, clothed in blue, horsemen riding upon horses (22:5, 6, 12, 23). “Oholah,” which here is Samaria, signifies a church in which truths are falsified; “her whoredoms,” which are treated of in this chapter, signify falsifications; “the Assyrians” signify reasonings by which truths are falsified; and because “to ride upon horses” signifies to reason from falsities that are from self-intelligence, it is said, “she doted on the Assyrians, horsemen riding upon horses;” the “blue, in which they were clothed,” signifies falsity appearing as truth, which appearance comes chiefly from applying the sense of the letter of the Word to principles of falsity. [31] In Jeremiah: The snort ing of his horses was heard from Dan; at the sound of the neighings of his stout ones the whole land quaked; and they came and devoured the land and its fullness; [the city] and those that dwell therein (8:16).

Those who abide in this alone, and do not read the Word from the doctrine of genuine truth, which should guide and illustrate, may be carried away into all kinds of errors; those who are carried away into errors or falsities are meant here by “Dan;” the consequent confirmation of falsities is meant by “the snorting of his horses;” and the"

That the church in respect to its truths and goods is thereby vastated, is signified by “the whole land quaked;” and “they came and devoured the land and its fullness, and those that dwell therein,” “the land” meaning the church, “its fullness” truths, and “those that dwell therein” goods. [32] In Isaiah: He hath lifted up an ensign to the nations from far, and hath hissed to him from the end of the earth, and behold the swift one shall come in haste, whose arrows are sharp, and all his bows are bent; the hoofs of his horses are reckoned as rock, and his wheels as a storm (5:26, 28). This, too, treats of those who are in ultimates in regard to the understanding of truth and as to the perception of good. These ultimates are what are called sensual impressions, which are the ultimates of the natural man (of which see in the Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, n. 50); from these, when separated from the spiritual man, stream forth all the evils and falsities that are in the church and in its doctrine; evils from this source are signified by “the nations that shall come from far;” and falsities by “him that cometh from the end of the earth;” “far,” and “the end of the earth” signifying those things that are remote front the truths and goods of the church. “The arrows that are sharp,” and “the bows that are bent” signify the falsities of doctrine prepared to destroy truths, and “the hoofs of the horses that are reckoned as rock,” and “his wheels that are as a storm” signify the ultimates of truth, like those in the sense of the letter of the Word, and arguments and confirmations of falsity by means of these; “the hoofs of the horses” mean the ultimates of the understanding, here of the perverted understanding, because separated from the understanding of the spiritual man; and because these ultimates are from the sense of the letter of the Word, it is said, “are reckoned as rock;” while “wheels” mean argumentations and confirmations by means of these, and because these appear strong they are said to be “as a storm.”"

This is plainly the meaning, for it follows, “for ye have turned judgment into gall, and the fruit of Justice into wormwood;” “to turn judgment into gall,” signifies to turn truth into falsity, and “to turn the fruit of justice into wormwood,” signifies to turn good into evil.

Thou hast caused a man to ride over our head; We entered into the fire and the waters: but Thou hast brought us out into a broad place (Ps. 66:11, 12). This is a description of spiritual captivity and deliverance therefrom. There is spiritual captivity when the mind is so shut up as not to perceive good nor understand truth; there is deliverance front it when the mind is opened; “the oppression upon the loins” signifies that there is no perception of good of love, for “loins” and “thighs” signify the good of love; “to cause a man to ride over our head” signifies that there is no understanding of truth; “man” here signifying intelligence from self (ex proprio), which is no intelligence; and “head” the like. Because this is the signification therefore it is said, “we entered into the fire and the waters,” “into the fire” meaning into the evils that are from the love of self, and “into the waters” meaning into falsities; deliverance therefrom is meant by “but Thou hast brought us out into a broad place,” “broad place” signifying truth (as above). [36] In Isaiah: Woe to them that go down into Egypt for help, and stay on horses, and trust in the chariot, but they look not unto the Holy One of Israel, neither seek Jehovah. For Egypt is man and not God, and its horses flesh and not spirit (31:1, 3). “Eat” in the Word signifies the knowing [faculty] (scientificum) which is in the natural man, and thence also the natural man; and because the natural man, with the knowing [faculty] that is in it, has no understanding, but only thought from the memory, which is a kind of imagination from objects of sight and hearing; and because this is beneath the spiritual, in which nevertheless all the goods and truths of heaven and the church reside, therefore “Egypt” signifies in most passages a falsified knowing [faculty] (scientificum falsum); for when the spiritual man does not flow in, knowledges in the natural man are turned into mere falsities, and its thoughts into confirmations of falsity and into reasonings from them against truths. From this it can be seen what is signified by “horses of Egypt and its chariots,” namely, that “the horses” signify"

These things are signified by “Woe to them that go down into Egypt, and stay on horses, and trust in chariots because they are many, and in horsemen because they are very strong;” “horses” here mean false knowledges; and “chariots” doctrinals therefrom; and “horsemen” reasonings from them against truths; therefore it is also said, “Egypt is man and not God, and his horses flesh and not spirit,” signifying that what is in them is merely natural and not spiritual, consequently that there is not in them anything of life; “man” signifying the natural man, and “flesh” what is its own (proprium); “God” and “spirit” signifying the Divine spiritual man, and life therefrom; and since they trust in themselves and not in the Lord, it is said, “they look not unto the Holy One of Israel, neither seek Jehovah.” [37] From this it can now be seen what is signified by the horses, the chariots, and the armies of Pharaoh, in Moses: I will be rendered glorious in Pharaoh and in his army and in his horsemen. And the Egyptians pursued the sons of Israel, and Pharaoh’s horses went after them, his chariots and his horsemen, into the midst of the sea. And Jehovah took off the wheel of their chariots, so that they drove them with difficulty. And when Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, the waters returned, and covered the chariots and the horsemen, together with the whole army of Pharaoh (Exod. 14:17, 18, 23, 25, 27, 28). Moses and the children of Israel sang this song unto Jehovah. In singing I will sing unto Jehovah, for in exalting He hath exalted Himself; the horse and his rider hath lie thrown into the sea, and his chariots and his army (Exod. 15:1, 4, 19, 21).

These things are said of the king, because the Lord in relation to Divine truth is represented by kings, and thence “kings” signify truths from good from the Lord (see above, n. 31). And as truths from good have their seat in the spiritual man, as was said above, and the knowledges that belong to the natural man serve the spiritual man as servants do their lord, it is said, “only he shall not multiply to himself horses, nor shall he bring back the people into Egypt, that he may multiply horses;” which signifies, only let no one from being a spiritual man become natural, and lead himself, and trust in what is his own instead of in the Lord, that is, let not the truths of the spiritual man serve the natural, instead of the knowledges of the natural man serving the spiritual; for this latter is according to order, but the former contrary to order. “Horses” of Egypt have a like signification elsewhere in the Word (as Jer. 46:4, 9; Ezek. 17:15; 23:20). 356. And he that sat on him had a bow, signifies the doctrine of charity and faith from that understanding, by which evils and falsities are combated and dispersed. This is evident from the signification of “he that sat on a white horse,” as meaning the Word (respecting which just above); also from the signification of “bow,” as meaning the doctrine of charity and faith, by which evils and falsities are combated and dispersed. That “bow” signifies this doctrine will be seen in what follows. Here first let something be said respecting doctrine: (1) Without doctrine no one can understand the Word."

(3) Without doctrine from the Word no one within the church, where the Word is, can become spiritual. (4) Doctrine can be acquired from no other source than from the Word, and by none except those who are in illustration from the Lord. (5) All things of doctrine must he confirmed by the sense of the letter of the Word. In respect to the first, namely, “Without doctrine no one can understand the Word,” it can be seen from this, that the sense of the letter consists of pure correspondences, which contain in themselves things spiritual, thus it consists of such things as are in the world and in its nature. From this it is that the sense of the letter is natural and not spiritual, accommodated, however, to the apprehension of the simple, who do not elevate their ideas above such things as they see before their eyes. From this it is, moreover, that it contains such things as do not appear to be spiritual, although the whole Word inwardly in itself is purely spiritual, because it is Divine. For this reason there are in the sense of the letter many things that cannot serve as doctrine for the church at this day, and many things that can he applied to various and diverse principles, and from this heresies arise; yet there are many things intermingled from which doctrine can be gathered and formed, especially the doctrine of life, which is the doctrine of charity and of faith therefrom. But he who reads the Word from doctrine sees there all things that confirm, as well as many things that lie concealed from the eyes of others; nor does he suffer himself to be drawn away into strange doctrines by those things in the Word that do not seem to agree, and that he does not understand; for all things of doctrine that he sees there are clear to him, and other things are obscure to him. Doctrine, therefore, which consists of genuine truths is as a lamp to those who read the Word; but on the other hand, to those who read the Word without"

From this it can be been that without doctrine no one can understand the Word. [2] Second, “That without doctrine from the Word no one can fight against evils and falsities, and disperse them,” can be seen from this, that from doctrine truths can be seen in their own light and in their own order, but not from the Word without doctrine. This is clear from what has just been said. But if truths cannot be seen, neither can falsities and evils be seen, for the latter are the opposite of the former; and yet all combat against evils and falsities is from truths, that is, by means of truths from the Lord; consequently he who reads the Word without doctrine may easily be led to fight for falsity against truth and for evil against good, by confirming evils and falsities by a wrong interpretation and application of the sense of the letter of the Word; and as a consequence the man is not reformed; for man is reformed by the dispersion of evils and the falsities of evil, by means of truths applied to the life. This is what is here meant by “the white horse” that was seen, and by “he that sat on him having a bow;” for “a white horse” signifies the understanding of truth from the Word, and “a bow” signifies the doctrine of charity and of faith therefrom by which evils and falsities are combated and dispersed. [3] Third, “That without doctrine from the Word no one within the church, where the Word is, can become spiritual,” can be seen from what has now been said, namely, that without doctrine the Word is not understood, and that without doctrine from the Word evils and falsities cannot be combated; for man becomes spiritual by means of a life according to Divine truths, which he does not know without doctrine, and by removing evils and falsities, which cannot be done without doctrine, as was said above. Without these two man is not reformed, thus does not become spiritual, but remains natural, and confirms his natural life by the sense of the letter of the Word, which is natural, by wrongly interpreting and"

It is said, within the church, where the Word is, since those who are out of the church do not have the Word, and therefore know nothing about the Lord; and no one becomes spiritual except from the Lord; and yet all who acknowledge a God and worship Him under the human form, and live in charity according to a religious principle that is in accord with the Word, are prepared by the Lord to receive spiritual life, and do receive it in the other life (on which see in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 313–328; and above, n. 107, 195a). Man becomes spiritual by regeneration, and regeneration is effected by “water and the spirit,” that is, by means of truths and a life according to them (see in the Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, n. 173–186; that baptism in the Christian world is for a sign and memorial of regeneration, n. “202–209, in the same work). [4] Fourth, “That doctrine can be acquired from no other source than from the Word, and by none except those who are in illustration from the Lord,” can he seen from this, that the Word is Divine truth itself, and is such that the Lord is in it; for the Lord is in His Divine truth that proceeds from Him; those, therefore, who frame doctrine from any other source than from the Word, do not frame it from Divine truth nor from the Lord. Moreover, in the particulars of the Word there is a spiritual sense, and the angels of heaven are in that sense; consequently there is a conjunction of heaven with the church by means of the Word; those, therefore, who frame doctrine from any other source than the Word do not frame it in conjunction with heaven, from which nevertheless is all illustration. (That the conjunction of heaven with man is by means of the Word, see in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 303–310.) From this it is evident that doctrine is to be acquired from no other source than the Word, and by none except those who are in illustration from the Lord. They are in illustration from the Lord who love truths because they are truths; and because such as these do them, they are in the Lord and the Lord is in them.

Let this be illustrated by this only; when man thinks any truth and confirms it by the sense of the letter, it is perceived in heaven, but not if he does not confirm it; for the sense of the letter is the basis into which spiritual ideas, which are the angel’s ideas, close, much the same as words are the basis into which the meaning of the thought falls and is communicated to another. That this is so might be confirmed by much experience from the spiritual world; but this is not the place to present it. 357a. That “a bow” signifies doctrine combating, or doctrine by which one fights against evils and falsities, and that “arrows,” “javelins,” and “darts,” signify the truths of doctrine which fight, can be seen from the following passages. In Zechariah: I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem, and the bow of war shall be cut off, and he shall speak peace to the nations. Return to the stronghold, ye bound ones of hope; and I will bend Judah for Me, and with a bow I will fill Ephraim, and I will stir up thy sons, O Zion, for Jehovah shall be seen over them, and His arrow shall go forth as lightning; and the Lord Jehovah shall blow with a trumpet, and He shall go in the storms of the south (9:10, 12–14). This treats of the vastation of the Jewish church and the establishment of a church among the Gentiles. The vastation of the Jewish church is described by “I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem, and the bow of war shall be cut off,” which signifies that there would be no longer any truth in the doctrine nor any understanding of truth, and thus no combat or resistance against falsity, “chariot” signifying the doctrine of truth, horse” the understanding of truth, “the bow of war” combat from doctrine against falsity; it is said “the bow of war” because doctrine combating is meant. “Ephraim” signifies the church in relation to the understanding of truth, and “Jerusalem” in relation to doctrine. The establishment of the church among the Gentiles is described by these words, “but he shall speak peace to the nations; return to the stronghold, ye bound ones of hope; and I"

Their illustration in truths is described by these words, “His arrow shall go forth as lightning; and the Lord Jehovih shall blow with the trumpet, and He shall go in the storms of the south;” the “arrow that shall go forth as lightning” signifies truth illustrated, thus truth from the good of love; “He shall blow with the trumpet” signifies the clear perception of good; and “the storms of the south” signify the clear understanding of truth, “the south” meaning the light of truth. This treats of the Lord, thus that these things are from the Lord. [2] In Moses: The son of a fruitful one is Joseph, the son of a fruitful one by the fountain; the daughters (she walketh upon the wall), they shall embitter him, and shall shoot; and the archers shall hate him; and he shall sit in the firmness of his bow, and the arms of his hands shall be strengthened by the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob; thence is he the shepherd, the stone of Israel (Gen. 49:22–24). “Joseph,” in the highest sense, signifies the Lord in relation to the spiritual kingdom. There are two kingdoms of heaven: one called the celestial kingdom, and the other the spiritual kingdom; the celestial kingdom is described in the prophecy respecting Judah, and the spiritual kingdom in this respecting Joseph. Those who are in the Lord’s celestial kingdom are in the good of love to Him, which is called celestial good; and those who are in the Lord’s spiritual kingdom are in the good of love to the neighbor, and thence in truths; and it is because all truths proceed from the Lord through the spiritual kingdom that Joseph is called “the son of a fruitful one, the son of a fruitful one by the fountain,” “a fruitful one” signifies spiritual good, which is the good of charity, “son” signifies truth from that good, and “a fountain” signifies the Word;"

[3] In the second book of Samuel: David lamented over Saul and over Jonathan his son, and wrote, To teach the sons of Judah the bow (1:17, 18). That lamentation treats of the combat of truth from good against the falsity from evil; for” Saul” as a king here signifies truth from good, for such truth is meant by “king” in the Word (see above, n. 31); and “Jonathan,” as the son of a king, signifies the truth of doctrine; therefore he wrote the lamentation, “To teach the sons of Judah the bow,” which signifies to teach them the doctrine of truth that is from good. The combat of that truth against falsities and evils is described in that lamentation by these words: Without the blood of the slain, without the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan returned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty (verse 22)."

This is said of the Lord and of His dominion over evils and falsities; the “nations that He gave before him,” signify evils; and the “kings over whom He made him to have dominion,” signify falsities; that He disperses evils and falsities as if they were nothing, by His Divine truth and by the doctrine therefrom, is signified by “He gave them as dust to his sword, and as stubble driven by his bow,” “his sword” meaning the Divine truth, and “his bow,” doctrine.

[8] In Isaiah: Before the swords shall they flee away, before the dawn sword, and before the bended bow; and for the grievousness of the war all the glory of Kedar shall be consumed, and the remnant of the number of the bow of the mighty of the sons of Kedar shall be few (21:15–17). This treats in the spiritual sense of the knowledges of good as about to perish, and that few will remain; “Kedar,” that is, Arabia, signifies those who are in the knowledges of good, and in an abstract sense such knowledges themselves. That the knowledges of truth are to perish through falsities and the doctrine of falsity, is signified by, “Before the swords shall they flee away, before the drawn sword, and before the bended bow,” “sword” meaning falsity combating and destroying, and “bow,” the doctrine of falsity. That the knowledges of good are to perish is signified by these words, “for the grievousness of the war all the glory of Kedar shall be consumed,” “the grievousness of war” meaning assault, and “all the glory of Kedar shall be consumed” meaning vastation.

[9] In the same: He hath made my mouth like a sharp sword; He hath made me a polished arrow; in His quiver bath He bid me (49:2). This also treats of the Lord; and “sharp sword” signifies the truth dispersing falsity; “the polished arrow” truth dispersing evil; and “quiver” the Word; this makes clear what is signified by “He bath made my mouth like a sharp sword,” and “He hath made me a polished arrow, and in His quiver hath He hid me,” namely, that in the Lord and from Him is the Divine truth, by means of which falsities and evils are dispersed, and that in Him and from Him is the Word, where and whence these truths are. [10] In David: Lo, sons are an heritage of Jehovah; the fruit of the belly is His reward. As arrows in the bands of a mighty one, so are the sons of youth. Happy is the man that hath filled his quiver with them; they shall not be ashamed when they speak with the enemies in the gate (Ps. 137:3–5). “Sons that are an heritage of Jehovah,” signify truths by which there is intelligence; the “fruit of the belly that is His reward,” signifies the goods, by which there is happiness; “the sons of youth that are as arrows in the hand of a mighty one,” signify the truths of the good of innocence; because nothing evil or false can resist these truths, it is said that they are “as arrows in the hand of a mighty one.” The good of innocence is the good of love to the Lord; because these truths have such power it is said, “Happy is the man that hath filled his quiver with them,” “quiver” here having a like signification as “bow,” namely, the doctrine from the Word; “they shall not be ashamed when they speak with the enemies in the gate” signifies that there shall be no fear because of evils from"

That they did not resist these because they were not conjoined to the Lord, is here signified by “they turned about in the day of battle, because they did not keep the covenant of God,” “covenant” meaning conjunction, and “not keeping it” meaning not to live according to the truths and goods that conjoin. 357c. [12] From the passages cited it can be seen that a “bow” signifies the doctrine of truth combating against falsities and evils and dispersing them. That this is the signification of “bow” can he seen further from its contrary sense, in which “bow” signifies the doctrine of falsity fighting against truths and goods and destroying them and “darts” and “arrows” its falsities themselves. In this sense “bow” is mentioned in the following passages. In David: Lo, the wicked bend the bow, they make ready their arrow upon the string, that they may shoot in darkness at the upright in heart (Ps. 11:2). “The wicked bend the bow” signifies that they frame doctrine; “they make ready the arrow upon the string” signifies that they apply into it falsities that appear as truths; “to shoot in darkness at the upright in heart” signifies to deceive those who are in truths from good; “bow” here meaning the doctrine of falsity, “arrow” the falsity itself; “to shoot” meaning to deceive, and “darkness” appearances; for such as these reason from appearances in the world and from fallacies, also by the application of the sense of the letter of the Word."

They lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel, and have no compassion; their voice resoundeth like the sea; and they ride upon horses arrayed as a man for war, against thee, O daughter of Zion (6:22, 23). This, too, describes the devastation of the church by the falsities of evil; what “a people from the land of the north” signifies, and “a great nation from the sides of the earth,” also what “their voice resoundeth like the sea,”and “they ride upon horses,” signify, was explained in the preceding article; “they lay hold on bow and spear” signifies [that they fight from false doctrine,” “bow” signifying] the falsity of doctrine destroying truth, and “spear” the falsity of evil destroying good; “daughter of Zion” meaning the church.

It is here attributed to God that He is indignant with the wicked, that He whets His sword, that He bends and makes ready His bow, prepares instruments of death, and makes His arrows burning; but in the spiritual sense it is meant that man does this in respect to himself. These things are attributed to God in the sense of the letter, because that sense is natural, and is for the natural man who believes that for these reasons God is to be feared; and with him fear works as love works afterwards, when he becomes spiritual. This makes clear what these words signify, namely, that it is the evil man who is indignant with God, that he whets the sword against himself, and bends the bow and makes it ready, he prepares the instruments of death, and makes his arrows burning. “He whetteth the sword” signifies that he acquires for himself falsity, by which he combats against truths; “He bendeth the bow and maketh it ready,” signifies that from falsities he frames for himself doctrine opposed to truths; and “He prepares the instruments of death, and maketh His arrows burning,” signifies that from infernal love he frames for himself principles of falsity by which he destroys good and its truth.

[27] In Jeremiah: Behold, I break the bow of Elam, the beginning of his might (49:35). “Elam” means the knowledge belonging to the natural man, and consequent confidence; his “bow” signifies the knowledge from which as from doctrine he fights; and “the beginning of his might” signifies confidence; for knowledge is of no avail if it does not serve the rational and the spiritual man. That “Elam” means knowledge belonging to the natural man can be seen from these passages in the Word in which “Elam” is mentioned (as Gen. 10:22; Isa. 21:2; Jer. 25:24–26; 49:34–39; Ezek. 32:24, 25).

This treats of “Gog,” which means those who are in external worship and in no internal worship; because such are in opposition to the spiritual affection of truth, which is to love truths because they are truths, they are in falsities in respect to doctrine, and in evils in respect to life; for no one can be reformed, that is, be withdrawn from falsities and evils except by means of truths; for this reason it is said that “the inhabitants of the cities of Israel shall go forth, and shall burn the arms, and the shield and the buckler, with the bow and the arrows, and the hand staff and the spear;” “the inhabitants of the cities of Israel” mean those who are in the affection of truth from good, that is, in the spiritual affection of truth, and thence in the doctrine of genuine truth; “to burn up the arms” signifies to extirpate falsities of every kind; the “shield” falsity destroying good; “the buckler” falsity destroying truth; “the bow with the arrows” doctrine with its falsities the “hand staff” and the “spear” signify one’s own power and confidence, such as pertain to those who place the all of the church, and thence of salvation, in external worship; “they shall kindle a fire with them seven years” signifies that these falsities and evils shall he completely destroyed, “seven years” signifying all things, fullness, and completely (see above, n. 257, 300). 358.

[2] “Crown” has a similar signification where temptations are treated of, because temptations are spiritual combats, as in the second chapter of this book, where these words occur: Behold, the devil is about to cast sole of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have affliction ten days; be thou faithful even till death, and I will give thee the crown of life (verse 10). Here “crown” signifies wisdom and eternal happiness, as may be seen above (n. 126). Wisdom and eternal happiness taken together are eternal life, for the very life of heaven is in wisdom and eternal happiness. The “crown” of the martyrs has a like signification because they were in affliction, and were “faithful even till death,” and were also in temptations and conquered; moreover, after death crowns were given them; but lest they should on that account appropriate honor to themselves, and thus acquire haughtiness, they cast them off from their heads. [3] Because in the Word “wars” signify wars in a spiritual sense which are combats against evils and falsities, and “kings” signify truths from good which fight against evils and falsities, in ancient times, when men had a knowledge of correspondences and representations, kings in their battles wore a crown upon the head, and a bracelet upon the arm, as can be seen in the second book of Samuel: The young man the son of an Amalekite, who told David that Sail and Jonathan were dead, said, I came upon Mount Gilboa, when behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and the chariots and leaders followed hard after him.

These combats are also signified by battles everywhere in the Word, even in the historical parts. (That “bracelet upon the arm” signifies the power of truth from good, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 3105. What further “crowns of kings” and “crowns” in general signify, see above, n. 272.) 359. And He went forth conquering and that He might conquer, signifies the removal of evils and of falsities thence to the end of life, and afterwards to eternity. This is evident from the signification of “to conquer” in the Word as being to conquer spiritually, which is to subjugate evils and falsities; but as these are not conquered otherwise than that they are taken away by the Lord, “to conquer” signifies the removal of evils and falsities. (That evils and falsities are removed, and not wiped out, or that man is withheld from them, and kept in good and truth by the Lord, see in the Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, n. 166; and Arcana Coelestia, n. 865, 868, 887, 894, 929, 1581, 2116, 2406, 4564, 8206, 8393, 8988, 9014, 9333–9338, 9446–9448, 9451, 10057,10060.) It is said “He went forth conquering and that He might conquer,” and “He went forth conquering” signifies the removal of evils and of falsities thence to the end of life; “and that He might conquer” signifies their removal afterwards to eternity; for he who fights against evils and falsities and conquers them, in the world even to the end of life, conquers them to eternity for such as man is at the end of his life in consequence of his past life, such he remains to eternity. “To conquer” signifies to conquer spiritually, because the Word is in its bosom spiritual, that is, in its bosom it treats of spiritual things, and not of earthly things; the earthly things that are in the sense of its letter merely serve its spiritual sense as a basis, into which spiritual things close and in which they are. “To conquer [or to overcome]” has a like signification in the following passages."

He that overcometh shall not be hurt by the second death (2:11). He that overcometh and keepeth My works unto the end, I will give him power over the nations (2:26). He that overcometh I will make him a pillar in the temple of God (3:12). He that overcometh I will give to him to sit with Me in My throne (3:21). They overcame the dragon through the blood of the Lamb, and through the word of the testimony (12:11). He that overcometh shall possess all things, and I will be to him God, and he shall be to Me a son (21:7). And in John: Jesus [said] to the disciples, These thing I have spoken unto you that in Me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation; but confide, I have overcome the world (16:33). The Lord’s “overcoming the world” means that He subjugated all the hells; for “the world” here signifies all evils and falsities, which are from hell (as also in John 8:23; 12:31; 14:17, 19, 30; 15:18, 19; 16:8, 11; 17:9, 14, 16).

This treats of the Lord, and His combats against the hells and their subjugation. He Himself in respect to His Divine Human is here meant by Edom, His garments sprinkled from Bozrah,” “His garments” signifying the Word in the letter, for” garments” signify truths investing, and in reference to the Lord they signify Divine truths, consequently the Word, since in it are all Divine truths (see above, n. 195c). The Word in the sense of the letter is also meant here by “garments,” because it contains investing truths, for the sense of the letter serves as a garment to the spiritual sense. And as the Word, in respect to that sense, was torn asunder by the Jewish people, and Divine truth was thereby adulterated, it is said, “His garments sprinkled from Bozrah, their victory is sprinkled upon My garments, and I have stained all My raiment,” “garments from Bozrah” signify the ultimate of the Word which is the sense of the letter, “their victory upon My garments” signifies the wrong interpretation and application of the truth by those who wrest the sense of the letter to favor their own loves, and the principles thence assumed, as was done by the Jews, and is done also at this day by many; this is meant by “their victory upon My garments.” That the Lord fought alone is signified by “I have trodden the wine press alone, and of the people not a man was with Me,” “wine press” signifying combat from Divine truths against falsities, because in wine presses the wine is pressed out from grapes, and “wine” signifies Divine truth; therefore “to tread it alone, and of the people not a man was with Me,” signifies alone, with no aid from anyone. That the Lord subjugated the hells is signified by, “I have trodden them in Mine anger, and trampled them in My wrath;” it is said, “I have trodden” and “I have trampled,” because of the reference to the wine press, and because destruction is signified; it is said, “anger” and “wrath” because the hells are destroyed; and in the sense of the letter this is attributed to the Lord, when nevertheless nothing of anger or wrath pertains to Him, but only to those who are against Him; it is according to appearance that it is so said here and in very many places elsewhere. That such were subjugated and condemned to hell is signified by, “I have made their victory to descend to the earth,” “to the earth”"

I heard the second animal saying, signifies out of the inmost heaven from the Lord. This is evident from what was said above (n. 353); for by the animals are meant cherubim, and “cherubim,” in the highest sense, signify the Lord in relation to providence and guard that He be not approached except through the good of love; and in a relative sense, the inmost heaven (see above, n. 152, 277, 3l3a, 322). “Cherubim” signify also the inmost heaven because this heaven is in the good of love to the Lord, and the Lord cannot be approached except through the heavens, and into the inmost or third heaven there is nothing admitted that does not savor of the good of that heaven. There were four animals or cherubim, because “four” signifies conjunction into one, and such is the conjunction with those who are there; for the Lord thus conjoins them by means of love to Him from Him. For this reason four were seen. From this also it is clear that the second animal here has a similar significance as the first, and similar as the third and fourth in what follows. (That “four” signifies conjunction, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 1686, 8877, 9601, 9674.) 363.

This is evident from the signification of “horse,” as being the intellect (of which above, n. 355). Here because the states of those who are of the church where the Word is are treated of, “horse” signifies the intellect of the men of the church in relation to the Word.

Since the horses that John saw were distinguished by colors, for the first appeared “white,” the second “red,” the third “black,” and the fourth “pale,” and colors signify the quality of a thing, let something first be said here about colors. In the heavens colors of every kind appear, and they draw their origin from the light there; and as that light immensely excels in brightness and splendor the light of the world, so also do the colors there; and as the light there is from the sun of heaven, which is the Lord, and is the Divine Proceeding, and as consequently that light is spiritual, so all colors signify things spiritual. And as the Divine Proceeding is Divine good united to Divine truth, and as Divine good in heaven is presented to view by a flamy light, and Divine truth by a bright white light, so there are two colors that are the fundamentals of all colors there, namely, the red color and the white color; the red color has its origin from the flamy light that goes forth from Divine good, and the white color from the bright white light that goes forth from Divine truth; consequently so far as colors are derived from red they signify good, and so far as they are derived from white they signify truth. (But these things can be seen better from what is told about colors, from experience, in the Arcana Coelestia, namely, that most beautiful colors are seen in the heavens, n. 1053, 1624; colors in the heavens are from the light there, and are modifications and variations of light, n. 1042, 1043, 1053, 1624, 3993, 4530, 4742, 4922; thus they are the appearances of truth and good, and signify such things as are of intelligence and wisdom, n. 4530, 4677, 4922, 9466; consequently the precious stones that were of various colors in the breastplate of the ephod, or in the Urim and Thummim, signified all things of truth from good in heaven and in the church, and therefore the breastplate in general signified Divine truth shining forth from the Divine good, n. 9823, 9865, 9868, 9905; and responses were thence given by variegations and resplendences of light, and at the same time by tacit perception, or by a living voice out of heaven, n. 3862, [9905]; colors so far as they are derived from red signify good, and so far as they are from bright white signify truth, n. 9467.

Therefore the red in heaven is a wholly different red from the red in hell; the red in heaven is shining and living, while the red in hell is horribly obscure and dead; moreover, the red of heaven gives life, while the red of hell brings death; the reason is that the fire from which red is derived is in its origin love; heavenly fire is from heavenly love, and infernal fire from infernal love; consequently “fire” in the Word signifies love in both senses (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 4906, 5071, 5215, 6314, 6832, 7575, 10747; and in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 134, 566–575); therefore the “red” existing thence signifies the quality of the love in both senses. Moreover, this red, that is, the “red” of this horse is, in the original Greek, from a word that means fire. All this, together with the description of this horse in this verse, makes clear why it is that a “red horse” signifies the understanding of the Word destroyed in respect to good. 364b. That “horse” signifies something connected with the subject can be clearly seen from this, that horses were seen when “the seals were opened,” and it was said that “they went forth,” for horses could not go forth out of a book, but those things could be manifested which are signified by “horses.” That “horse” signifies the intellect, and “color” its quality, has been made familiar to me from experience; for spirits who were meditating from the understanding upon some subject have several times been seen by me to be riding upon horses, and when I asked them whether they were riding, they said that they were not, but that they stood meditating upon some subject; which made clear that riding upon a horse is an appearance representing the operation of their understanding.

From this it can now be seen why John saw horses when the seals of the book were opened, and also what they signify. These horses were seen, because all the spiritual things of the Word are presented in the sense of its letter by means of such things as correspond, that is, as represent and thence signify; and this in order that the Divine may be there in ultimates and consequently in fullness, as has been several times said above. [4] That “reddish” or “red” signifies the quality of a thing in relation to good, can be seen also from the following passages in the Word. In Moses: Who washeth his vesture in wine, and his covering in the blood of the grapes. His eyes are redder than wine, and his teeth whiter than milk (Gen. 49:11, 12). These words are in the prophecy of Israel the father respecting Judah, and “Judah” here means the Lord in relation to the good of love, and in a relative sense the Lord’s celestial kingdom. What the particulars here signify in the spiritual sense may be seen in the Arcana Coelestia , where they are explained. Divine wisdom which is from Divine good is signified by “his eyes are redder than wine;” and Divine intelligence which is from Divine truth by “his teeth are whiter than milk” [5] In Lamentations: The Nazarites were whiter than snow, they were brighter than milk, their bones were more ruddy than pearls (4:7). The Nazarites represented the Lord in respect to the Divine Human (see above, n. 66, 196, at the end), therefore they signified"

[7] Because “red” signifies the quality of a thing in relation to good, those names also and the things that derive their names from this same word in the original tongue signify the good from which they are. The word red in the original is adam, from which is the name Adam, and also the name Edom; from this also man is called adam, the ground adama, and the ruby odam; thus these names and things are from red. “Adam” signifies the most ancient church, a church that was in the good of love; “Man” has a like signification, also “ground” in the spiritual sense when celestial good is treated of. That “Edom” was named from red, see Gen. 25:30; and for this reason it signifies the truth of the good of the natural man. That the ruby is also named from red may be seen in Exod. 28:17; 39:10; Ezek. 28:13; for this reason “ruby” signifies the truth of celestial good. (That “Adam” signifies the most ancient church, which was a celestial church, or a church in the good of love to the Lord, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 478, 479; that “Man” signifies the church in respect to good, n. 4287, 7424, 7523; that “ground” also has a like signification, n. 566, 10570; that “Edom,” because he was named from red, signifies the truth of good of the natural man, n. 3300, 3322; and that “ruby” signifies the truth of celestial good, n. 9865.) As “red” signifies the quality of a thing in relation to good, so in a contrary sense it signifies the quality of a thing in relation to evil, which is the opposite to good, consequently good destroyed. In this sense “red” is mentioned in the following passages. In Isaiah:"

This is evident from the signification of “him that sat upon the red horse,” as being the Word not understood in respect to good; for “he that sat upon the horse,” signifies the Word, as was shown above (n. 355a, c, 356), “horse” signifying the understanding of it (n. 355), and the “red horse” the understanding destroyed in respect to good (n. 364); therefore “he that sat upon the red horse” signifies the Word consequently not understood.

When these goods do not exist with the man of the church, the Word is not understood; for the conjunction of the Lord and the conjunction of heaven with the man of the church is by means of good; therefore if there is no good with him no illustration can be given; for all illustration when the Word is being read is out of heaven from the Lord; and when"

That the Word is not understood if man is not in good can also be seen from this, that in the particulars of the Word there is a heavenly marriage, that is, a conjunction of good and truth; therefore if good is not present with man when he is reading the Word, truth does not appear, for truth is seen from good, and good by means of truth. (That in the particulars of the Word there is a conjunction of good and truth, see above, n. 238 at the end, 288b.) [3] The state of the case is this: so far as man is in good the Lord flows in and gives the affection of truth, and thus understanding; for the interior human mind is formed entirely in the image of heaven, and the whole heaven is formed according to the affections of good and of truth from good; therefore unless there is good with man, that mind cannot be opened, still less can it be formed for heaven; it is formed by the conjunction of good and truth. From this it can also be seen that unless man is in good, truths have no ground in which to be received, nor any heat by which to grow; for truths with the man who is in good are like seeds in the ground in the time of spring; while truths with the man who is not in good are like seeds in ground bound by frost In the time of winter, when there is no grass, nor flower, nor tree, still less fruit.

It has been found that those who have confirmed themselves in this, both in doctrine and life, have not even a single right idea of truth; this, moreover, is why they do not know what good is, what charity and love are, what the neighbor is, what heaven and hell are, that they are to live after death as men, nor, indeed, what regeneration is, what baptism is, and many other things; yea, they are in such blindness respecting God Himself that they worship three in thought, and not one except merely with the mouth, not knowing that the Father of the Lord is the Divine in Him, and that the Holy Spirit is the Divine from Him. These things are said to make known that there is no understanding of the Word where there is no good. It is here said that to him that sat upon a red horse, it was given “to take peace from the earth,” because “peace” signifies a peaceful state of the mind (mens) and tranquillity of the disposition (animus) from the conjunction of good and truth; therefore “to take away peace” signifies an unpeaceful and untranquil state from the disjunction of good and truth, which is the cause of internal dissensions; for when good is separated from truth evil takes its place; and evil loves not truth but falsity; because every falsity belongs to evil, as every truth to good; when, therefore, such a person sees a truth in the Word or hears it from another, the evil of his love, and thus of his will, strives against the truth, and then he either rejects or perverts it, or by ideas from the evil so obscures it that at length he sees nothing of truth in the truth, however much it may sound as truth when he utters it. This is the origin of all dissensions, controversies, and heresies in the church. From this it can be seen what is here signified by “to take peace from the earth.” 365b. [5] But what peace is in its first origin is amply shown in the work on Heaven and Hell, where the state of peace in heaven is treated of (n. 284–290), namely that in its first origin it is from the Lord; it is in Him from the union of the Divine Itself and the Divine Human, and it is from Him by His conjunction with heaven and the church, and in particular from the conjunction of good and truth in each individual.

[6] That these things are signified by “peace” in the Word, can be seen from many passages therein, of which I will present the following by way of confirmation. In John: Jesus said, Peace I leave with you, My peace I give unto you, not as the world giveth give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid (14:27). This treats of the Lord’s union with the Father, that is, the union of His Divine Human with the Divine Itself which was in Him from conception, and thence of the Lord’s conjunction with those who are in truths from goods; therefore “peace” means tranquility of mind from that conjunction; and as such are protected by that conjunction from the evils and falsities that are from hell, for the Lord protects those who are conjoined with Him, therefore He says, “Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.” This Divine peace is in man, and as heaven is with it, “peace” here also means heaven and in the highest sense, the Lord. Put the peace of the world is from successes in the world, thus from conjunction with the world, and as this is only external and the Lord, and consequently heaven are not in it, it perishes with the life of a man in the world and is turned into what is not peace; therefore the Lord says, “My peace I give unto you; not as the world giveth give I unto you.” [7] In the same: Jesus said, These things I have spoken unto you that in Me ye may have peace. In the world ye have affliction; but have confidence I have overcome the world (16:33). Here, too, “peace” means internal delight from conjunction with the Lord, whence come heaven and eternal joy. “Peace” is here opposed to “affliction,” because “affliction” signifies infestation by evils and falsities, which those have who are in Divine peace so long as they live in the world; for the flesh which they then bear about"

And if a son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon it; but if not, it shall return to you again (10:5, 6). And in Matthew: Entering into a house salute it. And if the house be worthy let your peace come upon it; but if it be not worthy let your peace return to you. And whosoever shall not receive you nor hear your words, as ye go forth out of that house or city shake off the dust of your feet (10:12–14). That they were to say, “Peace be to the house” signifies that they were to learn whether those who were in it would receive the Lord; they were proclaiming the good tidings respecting the Lord, and thence respecting heaven, celestial joy, and eternal life, for all these are signified by “peace;” and those who received are meant by the “sons of peace,” upon whom peace would rest, but if they did not acknowledge the Lord, and consequently did not receive the things pertaining to the Lord, or to peace, that peace would be taken away from them is what is signified by “if the house or city be not worthy let your peace return to you;” that in such case they might suffer no harm from the evils and falsities that were in that house or that city, it was commanded that “going forth, they should shake off the dust of their feet,” which signifies that what is cursed therefrom might not cling to them, for “dust of the feet” signifies what is cursed; for what is ultimate in man, which is the sensual- natural, corresponds to the soles of the feet; and because evil clings to this, so in the case of those who were in the representatives of"

For in the spiritual world, when any good person comes to those who are evil, evil flows in from evil and causes some disturbance, but it disturbs only the ultimates that correspond to the soles of the feet; therefore when they turn and go away it appears as if they shook the dust off their feet behind them, which is a sign that they are delivered, and that evil clings to those that are in evil. (That “the soles of the feet” correspond to the lowest natural things, and therefore signify these in the Word, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 2162, 3147, 3761, 3986, 4280, 4938–4952; and that “dust, which should be shaken off,” signifies what is damned, n. 249, 7418, 7522.) [9] In Luke: Jesus wept over the city, saying, If thou hadst known, and indeed in this day, the things that belong to thy peace! but now it is hid from thine eyes (19:41, 42). Those who think of these words and those that follow immediately there, from the sense of the letter only, because they see no other sense, believe that these words were spoken by the Lord respecting the destruction of Jerusalem; but all things that the Lord spoke since they were from the Divine, did not relate to worldly and temporal things, but to heavenly and eternal things; therefore “Jerusalem, over which the Lord wept,” signifies here as elsewhere the church, which was then entirely vastated, so that there was no longer any truth and consequently no good, and thus that they were about to perish for ever; therefore He says, “if thou hadst known, and indeed in this day, the things that belong to thy peace,” that is, that belong to eternal life and happiness, which are from the Lord alone; for “peace,” as was said, means heaven and heavenly joy through conjunction with the Lord. [10] In the same: Zacharias prophesying said, The day-spring from on high appeareth to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace (1:67, 78, 79)."

The Lord is meant by “the day-spring from on high which appeareth;” and those who are out of the church are meant by “them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death;” and their illustration in Divine truths through the reception of the Lord and conjunction with Him, whence are heaven and eternal happiness, is meant by “the way of peace;” “guiding our feet into it” signifies instruction. [11] In the same: The disciples praised God, saying, Blessed is the King that cometh in the name of the Lord; peace in heaven and glory in the highest (19:37, 38). These things were said by the disciples when the Lord went to Jerusalem, that He might there, by the passion of the cross, which was His last temptation, wholly unite His Human to His Divine, and might also entirely subjugate the hells; and as all Divine good and truth would then proceed from Him, they say, “Blessed is the King that cometh in the name of the Lord,” which signified acknowledgment, glorification, and thanksgiving that these things were from Him (see above, n. 340 a,b); “peace in heaven and glory in the highest” signifies that the things meant by “peace” are from the union of the Divine Itself and the Divine Human, and that thence angels and men have them by conjunction with the Lord; for when the hells had been subjugated by the Lord, peace was established in heaven, and then those who were there had Divine truth from the Lord, which is “glory in the highest.” (That “glory” signifies Divine truth proceeding from the Lord, see above, n. 33, 288, 345.) 365c.

[12] Again in Moses: Jehovah bless thee and keep thee; Jehovah make His faces to shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee; and Jehovah lift up His faces upon thee, and give thee peace (Num. 6:24–26). Divine truth, from which is all intelligence and wisdom, with which the Lord flows in, is meant by “Jehovah makes His faces to shine upon thee;” and protection thereby from falsities is meant by “be gracious unto thee;” and the Divine good, from which is all love and charity, with which the Lord flows in, is meant by “Jehovah lift up His faces upon thee;” and protection thereby from evils, and thence heaven and eternal happiness, are meant by “give thee peace;” for when evils and falsities are removed and no longer infest, the Lord flows in with peace, in which and from which is heaven and the delight that fills with bliss the interiors of the mind, thus heavenly joy. (This benediction may also be seen explained above, n. 340b.) “Peace” has a like signification in David: Jehovah will bless His people with peace (Ps. 29:11). [13] And in the same: Who will show us good? Jehovah, lift Thou up the light of Thy faces upon us. Thou givest joy in my heart more than at the time when their corn and new wine are increased. In peace I at the same time lie down and sleep; for Thou alone, O Jehovah, dost make me to dwell securely (Ps. 4:6–8); This describes the peace that those have who are in conjunction with the Lord through the reception of Divine good and Divine truth from Him, and that it is peace in which and from which is heavenly joy. Divine good is meant by “Who will show us good?” and Divine truth by “lift Thou up the light of Thy faces upon us,” “the light of the Lord’s faces” is the Divine light that proceeds from Him as a sun in the angelic heaven, which light is in its essence Divine truth (as may be seen in the work on Heaven and Hell, n."

Heavenly joy therefrom is meant by “Thou givest joy in the heart”; multiplication of good and truth is meant by “their corn and new wine are increased,” “corn” signifying good, and “new wine” truth. Because peace is in these and from these, it is said, “In peace I at the same time lie down and sleep; for Thou alone, O Jehovah, dost make me to dwell securely,” “peace” signifying the internal delight of heaven, “security” the external delight, and “to lie down and sleep” and “to dwell” signifying to live. [14] In Moses: If ye walk in My statutes, and keep My commandments and do them, I will give peace in the land, so that ye may lie down securely, and none shall make afraid; and I will cause the evil wild beast to cease out of the land, and the sword shall not pass through the land (Lev. 26:3, 6). This describes the source of peace, that is, of heaven and heavenly joy. Peace viewed in itself is not heaven and heavenly joy, but these are in peace and from peace; for peace is like the dawn or like spring-time in the world, which dispose human minds to receive in the heart delights and pleasures from the objects that appear before the eyes, for that is what makes them delightful and pleasant; and because all things of heaven and of heavenly joy are in like manner from Divine peace, these also are meant by “peace.” Since man has heaven from living according to the commandments, for thence he has conjunction with the Lord, therefore it is said, “If ye walk in My statutes, and keep My commandments, and do them, I will give peace in the land;” that then they would not be infested by evils and falsities is meant by “they would lie down securely, and none make afraid,” and by “Jehovah will cause the evil wild beast to cease out of the land, and the sword shall not pass through it,” “the evil wild beast” signifying evil lusts, and “the sword” falsities therefrom; both these destroy good and truth from which is peace; and “land” signifies the church. (That “the evil wild beast” signifies evil lusts, and the destruction of good by them, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 4725. 7102, 9335; that “the sword” signifies falsities, and the destruction of truth by them, see above, n. 131b; and that “land” signifies the church, see also above, n. 29, 304.)

[15] In David: The miserable shall possess the land, and shall be delighted with the multitude of peace. Mark the perfect man, and see the upright, for to that man the latter end is peace (Ps. 37:11, 37). “The miserable” mean here those who are in temptations in the world; “the multitude of peace with which they shall be delighted” signifies the delights that follow temptations; for after temptations delights are given by the Lord from the conjunction of good and truth that follows temptation, and the consequent conjunction with the Lord. That man has the delight of peace from the conjunction of good and truth is meant by “Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright, for to that man the latter end is peace.” The perfection which is to be marked is predicated in the Word of good, and the uprightness which is to be seen is predicated of truth; the “latter end” means the termination when there is peace. [16] In the same: The mountains shall bear peace to the people, and the hills in righteousness. In His days shall the righteous flourish, and much peace until the moon be no more (Ps. 72:3, 7). This treats of the Lord’s coming and His kingdom; the “mountains which shall bear peace to the people,” signify love to the Lord; and the “hills in righteousness” signify charity towards the neighbor. (That this is the signification of “mountains” in the Word, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 795, 6435, 10438, for the reason that those who are in love to the Lord dwell in heaven upon mountains, and"

This makes clear that “peace” means heavenly joy which is from the conjunction with the Lord by love; “in His days shall the righteous flourish” signifies one who is in the good of love; therefore it is said, “and much peace;” for as was said above, peace is from no other source than from the Lord, and His conjunction with those who are in the good of love. It is said, “until the moon be no more,” which signifies that truth must not be separated from good, but the two must be so conjoined as to be a one, that is, so that truth also is good; for all truth is of good because it is from good, and therefore is its essence is good; truth is such with those who are in the good of love to the Lord from the Lord, who are here meant by the “righteous.” (That the “sun” signifies the good of love, and the “moon” truth therefrom, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 1521 1531 2495, 4060, 4696,7083.) [17] In Isaiah: Unto us a child is born, unto us a Son is given; upon whose shoulder is the government; he shall call His name Wonderful, Counselor, God, Hero, Father of Eternity, Prince of Peace. To the increase of His government and peace there shall be no end (9:6, 7). These things are said of the Lord’s coming, of whom it is said, “Unto us a child is born, unto us a Son is given,” because “child” in the Word signifies good, here Divine good, and “son” truth, here Divine truth. This is said on account of the marriage of good and truth that is in every particular of the Word; and as Divine good and Divine truth are from the Lord, He is called “Prince of Peace,” and it is said, “to the increase of His government and peace there shall he no end;” “government” is predicated of Divine truth, and “peace” of Divine good conjoined to Divine truth, therefore He is called the “Prince of Peace.” (That “Prince” is predicated of truths, and that it signifies the chief truth, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 1482, 2089, 5044, and above, n. 29; and that “peace” is predicated of the conjunction of good and truth, see above in this article.)"

[18] But as “peace” is mentioned in many passages of the Word, and the explanation must be adapted to the thing treated of, or to the subject of which it is predicated, and consequently its signification appears various, I will tell briefly what “peace” signifies, that the mind may not be borne hither and thither. Peace is bliss of heart and soul arising from the Lord’s conjunction with heaven and with the church, and this from the conjunction of good and truth with those who are therein; consequently there is no longer combat of evil and falsity against good and truth, or no dissension or war in a spiritual sense; from this is peace, in which all the fructification of good and the multiplication of truth takes place, and thence comes all wisdom and intelligence. And as this peace is from the Lord alone, and from Him with the angels in heaven, and with men in the church, so “peace” in the highest sense means the Lord, and in a relative sense, heaven and the church, and thus good conjoined to truth with those who are there. [19] From this an idea can be had of the signification of “peace” in the following passages. In David: Depart from evil and do good; seek peace, and pursue it (Ps. 34:14). “Peace” stands for all things that belong to heaven and the church, from which is the happiness of eternal life; and as only those who are in good have that peace, it is said, “depart from evil and do good; seek peace and pursue it.” [20] In the same: Much peace have they that love Thy law; and with them there is no stumbling. I have waited for Thy salvation, O Jehovah, and have done Thy commandments (Ps. 119:165, 166). “Peace” stands for heavenly blessedness, happiness, and delight, and as these are granted only with those that love to do the Lord’s commandments it is said, “Much peace have they who love Thy law.” “I have waited for Thy salvation, O Jehovah, and have done"

As peace is from Jehovah alone, that is from the Lord and in doing good from Him, it is said, “O Jehovah, ordain peace for us, for Thou hast wrought all our works for us.” [22] In the same: The angels of peace weep bitterly; the highways are wasted, the one passing through the path hath ceased (33:7, 8). As peace is from the Lord, and is in heaven from Him, therefore the angels are here called “angels of peace;” and as those on the earth who are in evils and in falsities therefrom have no peace, therefore it is said that they “weep bitterly,” because “the highways are wasted, the one passing through the path hath ceased;” “highways” and “a path” signifying the goods of life and the truths of faith; therefore “the highways are wasted” signifies that there are no longer goods of life, and “the one passing through the path hath ceased” signifies that there are no longer truths of faith. [23] In the same: O that thou hadst attended to My commandments! then had thy peace been as a river, and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea. There is no peace, saith Jehovah, unto the wicked (48:18, 22).

All thy sons shall be taught of Jehovah; and much shall be the peace of thy sons (54:10, 13). This treats of a new heaven and a new church. The former heaven and the former church that were to perish are meant by “the mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed;” that those who are in the new heaven and the new church will be in good from the Lord and possess heavenly joy to eternity through conjunction with the Lord is signified by, “My mercy shall not depart from with thee, and the covenant of My peace shall not be removed,” “mercy” signifying good from the Lord, and “the covenant of peace,” heavenly joy from conjunction with the Lord, “covenant” meaning conjunction; “the sons who shall be taught of Jehovah, and who shall have much peace” mean those in the new heaven and in the new church who will be in truths from good from the Lord, that they will have eternal blissfulness and happiness; “sons” in the Word signify those who are in truths from good; and that they are “taught of Jehovah” signifies that they are in truths from good from the Lord; and “much peace” signifies eternal blissfulness and happiness.

[26] In Malachi: That My covenant may be with Levi; My covenant with him was of life and peace. The law of truth was in his mouth, and perversity was not found in his lips; be walked with Me in peace and uprightness (2:46). “Levi” signifies all who are in the good of charity towards the neighbor, and in the highest sense, the Lord Himself, because that good is from Him; here the Lord Himself is meant. “The covenant of life and peace” signifies the union of His Divine with His Divine Human, from which union is all life and peace. That Divine truth is from Him is signified by “the law of truth was in his mouth, and perversity was not found in his lips;” the unition itself which was effected in the world, is meant by, “he walked with Me in peace and uprightness.” (That “Levi” in the Word signifies spiritual love or charity, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 4497, 4502, 4503; and that by him in the highest sense the Lord is meant, n. 3875, 3877.) 365e.

The fructification of good by truths and the multiplication of truth from good are signified by “then the tree shall give its fruit, and the land shall give its produce,” “tree of the field” signifying the knowledges of truth, “fruit” signifying good therefrom, “land” signifying the church in relation to good, thus also the good of the church, and “its produce” signifying the consequent multiplication of truth. That these things shall come to pass with them when the Lord has removed the evils and falsities pertaIning to them is signified by “when I shall have broken the bonds of their yoke, and delivered them out of the hand of those who make them to serve;” “the bonds of the yoke” meaning the delights of evil from the love of self and the world, which keep them bound, and “those who make them to serve” meaning falsities, since these make them to serve those evils.

[29] In David: Jehovah will speak peace unto His people and to His saints, that they may not turn again to folly. Mercy and truth 1 meet together; righteousness and peace do kiss each other (Ps. 85:8, 10). “Jehovah will speak peace unto His people and to His saints, signifies that He will teach and give conjunction with Himself by the conjunction of good and truth with them, “peace” signifying both these conjunctions, “people” those who are in truths from good, and “saints” those who are in good by means of truths; that such thereafter will have no evil from falsity, or falsity from evil, is signified by “that they may not turn again to folly.” Both these conjunctions are further described by “mercy and truth meet together, righteousness and peace do kiss each other,” “mercy” here signifying removal from falsities, and the consequent possession of truths, [which makes clear the signification of “mercy and righteousness meet together,”] and “righteousness” signifying the removal from evils and the consequent possession of goods, which makes clear the signification of “righteousness and peace do kiss each other.” [30] In Isaiah: How joyous upon the mountains are the feet of him that proclaimeth good tidings, that maketh peace to be heard; that proclaimeth good tidings of good, that maketh salvation to be heard; that saith unto Zion, Thy King reigneth (52:7).

[31] In the same: But He was pierced for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement of our peace was upon Him, and by His wound healing was given to us (53:5). This is said of the Lord, of whom this chapter evidently treats, and these words describe the temptations that He underwent in the world that He might subjugate the hells, and reduce all things there and in the heavens into order. These grievous temptations are meant by “He was pierced for our transgressions, and bruised for our iniquities,” and “the chastisement of our peace was upon Him;” “by His wound healing was given to us” signifies salvation by that means. Therefore “peace” here signifies heaven and eternal life to those who are conjoined with Him; for the human race could by no means be saved if the Lord had not reduced all things in the hells and in the heavens into order, and at the same time glorified His Human, and these were accomplished by temptations admitted into His Human.

(That these are meant by “brethren” and “companions” in the Word, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 10490, and above, n. 47.) “The house of Jehovah our God” signifies the church in which these things are.

[37] In the same: Jehovah shall bless thee out of Zion; that thou mayest see the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life; that thou mayest see the sons of thy sons, peace upon Israel (Ps. 128:5, 6). “Zion” and “Jerusalem,” here as above, signify the church in relation to the goods of love and in relation to the truths of doctrine; the words “Jehovah bless thee out of Zion” mean blessing that is from the good of love, for “Zion” signifies the church in relation to the good of love; and as from that good every good and truth of doctrine proceeds and exists, it is said “that thou mayest see the good of Jerusalem, and the sons of thy sons;” “sons of sons” signifying the truths of doctrine and their multiplication to eternity. As all things are from the Lord and through the peace which is from Him, the concluding words are, “that thou mayest see peace upon Israel,” “Israel” meaning those with whom is the church. [38] In the same: In Salem is the tabernacle of God, and His abode in Zion. There brake He the fiery shafts of the bow, the shield, and the sword, and war (Ps. 76:2, 3).

Moreover, from “peace”: Jerusalem was called Shalomim (Jer. 13:19). And on that account Melchizedek, who was the priest of God Most High, was king of Salem [peace] (Gen. 14:18); and by him the Lord was represented; as is evident in David, where it is written: Thou art a priest for ever after the manner of Melchizedek (Ps. 110:4). 365g.

That from this are spiritual love and celestial love, by which conjunction with the Lord is effected, is signified by “ye shall be taken up to her side, and be caressed upon her knees,” “the side” signifying spiritual love, and “knees” celestial love, and “to be taken up and caressed” signifying eternal happiness from conjunction. (That the “breast” signifies spiritual love, and also “the side” or “bosom,” see above, n. 65; that “knees” signify conjugial love, and thence celestial love, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 3021, 4280, 5050–5062.) That “glory” signifies Divine truth, and intelligence and wisdom therefrom, may be seen above (n. 33, 288, 345); and that “nations” signify those who are in the good of love, and in a sense abstracted from persons, the goods of love, may also be seen above (n. 175a, 331); therefore “the glory of the nations” signifies genuIne truth which is from the good of love, thus the conjunction of these.

That there are to be those who are spiritual, and not natural as before, is signified by “for brass I will bring gold, for iron silver, and for stones iron;” “brass,” “iron,” and “stones” signifying things natural, and “gold,” “silver,” and “iron” in place thereof, signifying things spiritual; “gold” spiritual good, “silver” the truth of that good, and “iron” spiritual-natural truth. That the Lord is to rule by the good of love is signified by, “I will make thy government peace, and thine exacters righteousness;” “government” signifying kingdom, “peace” the Lord, and “righteousness” good from Him.

[42] As those have peace who are in the conjunction of good and truth from the Lord, and as evil destroys good, and falsity destroys truth, so do these destroy peace. From this it follows that those who are in evils and falsities have no peace. It appears as if they had peace when they have success in the world, and they even seem to themselves at such times to be in a contented state of mind; but that apparent peace is only in their extremes, while inwardly there is no peace, for they think of honor and gain without limit, and cherish in their minds cunning, deceit, enmities, hatreds, revenge, and many like things, which unknown to themselves, rend and devour the interiors of their minds, and thence also the interiors of their bodies. That this is so with them is clearly seen after death, when they come into their interiors; these delights of their minds are then turned into their contraries (as is evident from what has been shown in Heaven and Hell, n. 485–490). [43] That those have peace who are in good and in truths therefrom, and that those who are in evil and in falsities therefrom have no peace, can be seen from the following passages. In Isaiah: The wicked are like the sea driven along, when it cannot he quiet, but its waters drive along the filth and mud; [there is no peace, saith My God, to the wicked] (57:20, 21). Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood; their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity; devastation and breaking are in their paths. The way of peace they know not; and there is no judgment in their courses; they have made crooked their paths for themselves; whosoever treadeth therein doth not know peace (54:7, 8). In David:"

The prophets of Israel see a vision of peace, when there is no peace (13:10, 16). In Jeremiah: All, from the least unto the greatest, pursue gain; from the prophet even unto the priest everyone doeth a lie. And they heal the breach of the daughter of My people by a word of no weight, saying, Peace, peace, when there is no peace (8:10, 11).

That they should slay one another, signifies the falsification or extinction of truths. This is evident from the signification of “slaying,” as meaning the extinction of truths; for “to slay” in the Word signifies to slay spiritually, that is, to slay the spiritual part of a man or his soul, which is to extinguish truths. It also means to falsify, because when truths are falsified they are also extinguished; for falsification pro duces a different understanding of truths, and truth is true to everyone according to his understanding of it; for the love and principle that rule in man draw and apply all things to themselves, even truths themselves; consequently when the love is evil, or the principle is false, then truths are infected with the evil of the love or the falsity of the principle, and thus are extinguished. This, therefore, is what is here signified by “they should slay one another.” That this takes place when there is no good with man, and especially when there is no good in the doctrine of his church, is evident from the preceding words, where it is said, “When he had opened the second seal there went forth a red horse; and to him that sat upon him it was given to take peace from the earth;” which signifies a second state of the church when the understanding of the Word is destroyed in respect to good, which is the source of dissensions in the church (of which see above, n. 361, 364, 365).

From this it can be seen that when evil or an evil love is with man there can be no truth or faith of truth with him; for the light that goes forth from such fire is the light that those have who are in hell, which is a fatuous light like the light from burning coals, which light, when light from heaven flows in, is turned into mere thick darkness. Such also is the light that with the evil, when they reason against the things of the church, is called natural light (lumen). [3] That they would falsify and thereby extinguish truths is meant also by the Lord’s words in Matthew: Jesus said to the disciples, The brother shall deliver up the brother, the father the son; children shall rise up against parents, and cause them to be put to death (10:21). And in Luke: Ye shall be delivered up by parents, and brethren, and kinsfolk, and friends; and some of you shall they cause to be put to death (21:16). “Parents,” “brethren,” “children,” [”kinsfolk,”] and “friends,” do not mean here parents, brethren, children, kinsfolk, friends, nor do “disciples” mean disciples, but the goods and truths of the church, also evils and falsities; it is also meant that evils would extinguish goods and falsities truths. (That such is the signification of these words, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 10490.) 367. And to him was given a great sword, signifies by means of falsities. This is evident from the signification of “sword” (machaera seu gladius), as being truth fighting against falsity; and in a contrary sense, falsity fighting against truth and the destruction of truth (see above, n. 131); here it means falsity fighting against truth and destroying it; for it is said just before “that they should slay one"

This is said of “Assyria,” which is here compared to a cedar. “Assyria” here signifies reasoning about the truths of the church from self-intelligence, and “cedar” the truth of the spiritual church; that by such reasoning all knowledges of truth, and with them all truths that savor of good and have their essence from good, would be destroyed is signified by all these words; the “abyss which is covered over him,” and the “rivers that were withheld,” mean the knowledges of truth and intelligence therefrom, the “abyss” or “sea” signifying the knowing and the cognizing faculties in general that are in the natural man, and “rivers” signifying the things that pertain to intelligence; the “great waters that shall be held back,” signify the truths which savor of good and derive their essence from good, “waters” mean truths, and “great” in the Word is predicated"

[5] In Lamentations: The Nazarites were whiter than snow, they were brighter than milk. Their form is more dark than blackness; they are not known in the streets (4:7, 8). No one can know what this signifies unless he knows what the Nazarites represented. “The Nazarites” represented the Lord in respect to the celestial Divine; and as all the statutes of the church at that time represented such things as belong to heaven and the church, thus to the Lord, for all things of heaven and the church are from the Lord, and as the Nazariteship was the chief representative of the Lord, these words signify that every representative of the Lord had perished. A genuine representative of the Lord is described by “the Nazarites were whiter than snow, and brighter than milk,” which signifies a representative of Divine truth and Divine good in its perfection; for “white” is predicated of truth, in like manner “snow,” and “brightness” of the good of truth, in like manner “milk.” That every representative of Divine truth had perished is described by “their form is darker than blackness, they are not known in the streets,” “form” signifying the quality of truth, “blackness” signifying its no longer appearing, “streets” signifying the truths of doctrine, and “not to be known in them” signifying not to be recognized by genuine truths.

Since in the churches before the Lord’s coming, which were representative churches, mourning represented spiritual grief of mind on account of the absence of truth and good, for they mourned when oppressed by an enemy, on the death of a father or mother, and for like things, and oppression by an enemy signified oppression by evils from hell, and father and mother signified the church in respect to good and in respect to truth, because with them these things were represented by mourning, they at such times went in black. [7] As in David: I say unto God my rock, why hast Thou forgotten me? Why shall I go in black because of the oppression of the enemy (Ps. 42:9; 43:2).

That “to be made black” signifies spiritual grief of mind because of the absence of truth in the church is evident from the particulars here in the internal sense; for “Judah” signifies the church in respect to the affection of good; and “Jerusalem” the church in respect to the doctrine of truth; “gates” signify admission to the church. That there were no longer any truths is described by “the nobles sent their little ones for water, they came to the pits and found no waters, their vessels return empty,” “waters” signifying truths, and “pits” the things that contain, which are the doctrinals from the Word and the Word itself, and in these truths are no longer seen. From this it can be seen that “black” (nigrum) and “black” (atrum) in the Word signify the absence of truth; and “darkness,” “clouds,” “obscurity,” and many things from which blackness arises have a like signification. As in Joel: A day of darkness and of thick darkness, a day of cloud and of obscurity (2:2); and in other passages. 373.

There were many measures in the representative church, as the omer, the homer, the ephah, the bath, the hin (about which see Arcana Coelestia, n. 10262); and besides there were balances and scales, by which weighings and balancings were made, and these in a particular sense signified the estimations of anything in respect to truth. For this reason also the weights of the scales were stones, or made of stones, “stones” in the Word signifying truths. That the weights were stones, or made of stone, appears from Lev. 19:36; Deut. 25:13; 2 Sam. 14:26; Isa. 34:11; Zech. 4:10. (That “stones” in the Word signify truths, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 643, 3720, 6426, 8609, 10376.) Here, therefore, “a balance in the hand of him that sat upon the black horse” signifies the estimation of truth from the Word. [2] It has been shown above that “he that sat upon the horses” —the white, the red, the black, and the pale horse—signifies the Word, and the “horses,” according to their colors, signify the understanding of the Word, “the red horse” the understanding of the Word destroyed in respect to good, and “the black horse” the understanding of the Word destroyed in respect to truth. But as it is difficult to comprehend that “he that sat upon the horses” signifies the Word, in consequence of the red and the black horses signifying the understanding of the Word destroyed in respect to good, and in respect to truth, it shall be explained how it is. The Word in itself is Divine truth, but the understanding of it is according to the state of the man who reads it. A man who is not in good perceives nothing of the good in it, and a man who is not in truths sees nothing of the truth in it; the cause of this, therefore, is not in the Word, but in him who reads it. This makes clear that “he that sat upon the horses” signifies the Word, although the horses themselves signify the understanding of the Word destroyed in respect to good and in respect to truth. That “he that sat upon the white horse” signifies the Word is plainly evident in Revelation, where it is said: The name of the one sitting upon that horse is called the Word of God (19:13)."

Mene, Mene, Tekel, Perezin, that is, numbered, numbered, weighed, divided. This is the interpretation of these words: Mene, God hath numbered thy kingdom and brought it to an end. Tekel, Thou art weighed in the balance and art found wanting. Peres, Thy kingdom is divided and given to the Mede and the Persian (5:25–28). This history describes in the internal sense the profanation of good and truth, which is signified by “Babylon,” for Belshazzar was king in Babylon, and a “king” in the Word signifies the same as the nation or kingdom itself over which he reigns. The profanation of the good and truth of the church is signified by “his drinking out of the vessels of gold and silver belonging to the temple at Jerusalem, and at the same time praising the gods of gold, silver, brass, iron, wood, and stone” (verses 3 and 4). “The gold and silver vessels belonging to the temple at Jerusalem,” signify the good and truth of heaven and the church, “gold” meaning good, and “silver” truth; and “praising the gods of gold, silver, brass, iron, wood, and stone,” signifies idolatrous worship of every kind, thus external worship without any internal, such as is with those who are meant by Babylon. That there is no church at all with such, because there is nothing of the good and nothing of the truth of the church in them, is signified by the writing from heaven; for “numbered, numbered,” signifies exploration in respect to good and in respect to truth; “weighed in the balance,” signifies estimation ln accordance with their quality, and judgment; “divided,” signifies dispersion and expulsion from the good and truth of the church and separation therefrom; and “kingdom” signifies the church; from which it is clear that “weighed in the scale or balance,” signifies estimation in accordance with their quality. (That “to divide” signifies to disperse, to expel, and to separate from good and truth, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 4424, 6360, 6361, 9093.) “Kingdom” means the church, because the Lord’s kingdom is where the church is, therefore those who are of the church are called “sons of the kingdom” (Matt. 8:12; 13:38)."

(40:12). These measures describe the just arrangement and estimation of all things in heaven and in the church according to the quality of good and truth. The measures here are, “the hollow of the hand,” “the span of the hand,” “the measure [of three fingers],” “the balance” and “the scales”; “waters” signify truths; “the heavens” interior or spiritual truths and goods; “the dust of the earth” exterior or natural truths and goods, both of heaven and of the church; “mountains” the goods of love; “hills” the goods of charity; and “to weigh” means to estimate and arrange in accordance with their quality. That such is signification of these words, no one can see except from a knowledge of correspondences. [5] As a just estimation and exploration of good and truth are signified in the Word by “measures,” it was commanded that the measures should be just, with no fraud about them. In Moses: Ye shall not do perversity in judgment, in measure, in weight, or in dimension. Just balances, just stones, a just ephah, and a just bin shall ye have (Lev. 19:35, 36). So justice, where it means the estimation and exploration of men in accordance with the quality of good and truth in them, is everywhere in the Word expressed by scales and balances of various kinds, and by “ephahs,” “omers,” “homers,” “seas,” “hins” (as in Job 6:2; 31:6); and injustice is expressed by “scales and balances of fraud and deceit” (as in Hosea 12:7; Amos 8:5; Micah 6:11). 374a. Verse 6. A measure of wheat for a denary, and three measures of barley for a denary, signifies that the genuine good of the church, as also the genuine truth of the church, is of no account to them.

Because this was the smallest coin, it signifies the least worth, but here as of no account. The reason for this is that “the red horse” (mentioned above), signifies the understanding of the Word destroyed in respect to good, and “the black horse” the understanding of the Word destroyed in respect to truth (see above, n. 364, 372); and when the understanding of the Word in respect to good and in respect to truth has been destroyed, then the genuine good and the genuine truth of the church are estimated as of no account. The “denary” is here taken as the standard of estimation, because some piece of money must be taken that some price may he, expressed in the sense of the letter, since it is said that “a balance was in the hand of him that sat upon the horse,” and that “the wheat and the barley were measured;” consequently the smallest coin of all was taken as the standard of the estimation of the price; and as there was no longer any understanding of the Word in respect to good and in respect to truth, a “denary” in the spiritual sense here signifies as of no account. [2] It is said, “a measure of wheat and three measures of barley,” because “one” is predicated of good, and “three” of truths; and “one,” when predicated of good, signifies what is perfect, thus also what is genuine; and “three,” when predicated of truths, signifies what is full, thus also what is genuine; consequently “a measure of wheat and three measures of barley” signify the genuine good and the genuine truth of the church. “Wheat” signifies good, and “barley” its truth, because all things belonging to the field signify the things that belong to the church; and things belonging to the field, as crops of various kinds, serve for food; and things for food and for the nourishment of the body signify in the spiritual sense such things as nourish the soul or mind, all of which have relation to the good of love and the truth of faith; thus especially wheat and"

That “wheat” and “barley” have such a signification is from correspondence, as is evident from the things that appear in the spiritual world, where all appearances are correspondences. There plains, fields, crops of various kinds, and also bread appear; from this is the knowledge that they are correspondences, and consequently that they have significations according to correspondences. [3] That “wheat” and “barley” signify the good and truth of the church, “wheat” its good, and “barley” its truth, can be seen also from the passages in the Word where they are mentioned, as from the following. In Jeremiah: Jehovah, who hath dispersed Israel, will bring him together and will keep him as a shepherd doth his drove; for Jehovah hath ransomed Jacob, and hath redeemed him out of the hand of him that was stronger than he. Therefore shall they come and sing aloud in the height of Zion, and shall flow together unto the good of Jehovah, to the wheat, to the new wine, and to the oil, and to the sons of the flock, and of the herd; and their soul shall become as a watered garden (31:10–12). This treats of the establishment of a new church; “Israel” and “Jacob” signify that church, “Israel” the internal spiritual church, and “Jacob” the external; for every church is internal and external. Its establishment is described by “Jehovah will bring him together and will keep him as a shepherd doth his drove, for He hath ransomed Jacob, and hath redeemed him out of the hand of him that was stronger than he;” “to redeem” signifies to reform (see above, n. 328); “out of the hand of him that was stronger than he” signifies out of evil and falsity, which before had possession; the"

The husbandmen were ashamed, the vine dressers howled for the wheat and for the barley, because the harvest of the field hath perished (1:10, 11). This is not said of a field and its barrenness, but of the church and its vastation; therefore “field,” “ground” “corn,” “new wine,” and “oil” do not mean these things themselves, but “field” and “ground” mean the church, “field” the church in relation to the reception and bringing forth of truth and good, and “ground” the church in respect to the nation that is in it; “corn” means good of every kind in the external man; “new wine” the truth also therein; “oil” the good in the internal man; “the husbandmen that were ashamed,” and “the vine dressers that howled for the wheat and for the barley,” signify those who are of the church, “wheat” and “barley” signifying the good and truth of the church; and “the harvest of the field that thus perished” signifying all worship from good and truth."

In the sense of the letter this is a description of the land of Canaan, but in the spiritual sense the Lord’s church is described, since this is meant in that sense by “the land of Canaan;” and all kinds of good and truth pertaining to the church are enumerated. The land is called “a land of brooks of water,” because “brooks of water” signify the doctrinals of truth; “fountains and depths going forth in valley and mountain” signify interior and exterior truths from the Word, “fountains,” interior truths therefrom, and “depths” exterior truths.

One who does not know the spiritual sense of the Word believes no otherwise than that this merely describes the land of Canaan; but in that case the Word would be merely natural, and not spiritual, and yet the Word everywhere is in its bosom spiritual, and it is spiritual when by these words are understood the spiritual things they signify, namely, goods and truths of every kind.

This intelligence and wisdom from the Lord is signified by “Jehovah made him to ride upon the high places of the earth, and fed him with the increase of the fields “the celestial and spiritual goods that they received through truths are described by “He made him to suck honey out of the cliff, and oil out of the flint of the rock; butter of the herd and milk of the flock, with the fat of lambs, and of rams, the sons of Bashan, and of he-goats, with the fat of the kidneys of wheat; and thou drinkest the blood of grapes, unmixed wine,” “wheat” signifying here in a general sense all good, and “blood of grapes” and “unmixed wine” all truth therefrom. [11] In David: O that my people would hearken unto Me, and Israel would walk in My ways! I would feed them with the fat of wheat; and with honey out of the rock I would satisfy them (Ps. 81:13, 16). “Fat of wheat,” and “honey out of the rock with which they would he fed and satisfied,” signify good of every kind from celestial good and enjoyment thereof from the Lord; for “fat” signifies celestial good, “wheat” good of every kind, “honey” the enjoyment of good, and “rock” the Lord. That those who live according to the Lord’s commandments will possess these things, is meant by “O that My people would hearken unto Me, and Israel would walk in My ways!” “ways” in the Word signifying truths and also commandments, and “to walk” signifying to live.

[13] In Hosea: Jehovah said to the prophet, Go yet, love a woman beloved of her companion, and an adulteress, even as the love of Jehovah to the sons of Israel, who regard other gods, and love flagons of grapes. And I bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver, and for an omer of barley, and a half homer of barley (3:1, 2). This represented what the Jewish and Israelitish church was in respect to doctrine and worship, namely that by vain traditions it had falsified all things of the Word, though worshiping it as holy; “a woman beloved of her companion, and an adulteress whom the prophet should love,” signifies such a church, “a woman” signifying the church, and “beloved of her companion and an adulteress” the falsification of truth and the adulteration of good; “even as the love of Jehovah to the sons of Israel, who regard other gods,” signifies the falsities of doctrine and the evils of worship; these are signified by “regarding other gods;” “loving flagons of grapes” signifies the Word in the sense of the letter alone, for “wine” signifies the truths of doctrine from the Word, “grapes” its goods from which are truths, and “a flagon” signifies that which contains, thus the ultimate sense of the Word, which is the sense of the letter, and which they apply to their falsities and evils. “He bought her to him for fifteen pieces of silver” signifies for a small price, “fifteen” meaning very little; “an omer of barley” and “half an omer of barley” signifying so little of good and truths as to be scarcely any."

[15] In the same: Jesus said, The kingdom of the heavens is like unto a man that sowed good seed in his field; but while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares, and went away. But when the blade sprang up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also. And the servants of the householder coming said unto him, Lord, didst thou not sow good seed in thy field? whence then hath it tares? Then he said unto them, A man, an enemy hath done this. But the servants said, wilt thou then that we going out gather them up? But he said, Nay; lest haply while ye gather up the tares, ye root up at the same time the wheat with them. Let both grow together until the harvest; and in the season of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye first the tares and bind them in bundles to burn them, but gather the wheat into my barn (13:24–30). What these words involve is very clear from the spiritual sense, for the particulars here are correspondences. For when the Lord was in the world, He spoke by pure correspondences, because He spoke from the Divine.

What the remainder to the end signifies, can be seen from what is presented in the small work on (n. 70); for it involves arcana that are there explained; here it need only be said that “wheat” signifies the good of truth, and therefore those who are in good through truths; and that “tares” signify the evil of falsity, and therefore those who are in evil through falsities. That these things are said of the last judgment is evident from what follows in the same chapter, where it is said: He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man; the field is the world; the seed are the sons of the kingdom; the tares are the sons of the evil one; the enemy is the devil; the harvest is the consummation of the age (verses 37–39). “The consummation of the age” is the last time of the church when judgment takes place. From these passages quoted from the Word it can be seen that “wheat” signifies the good of the church in general, and “barley” its truth. 375a. And the oil and the wine hurt thou not, signifies that it is provided that the internal or spiritual sense of the Word should suffer no harm either in respect to good or in respect to truth. This is evident from the signification of “oil,” as being the good of love (of which presently); from the signification of “wine,” as being the truth of that good, for every good has its truth, that is, every truth is of good, therefore such as the good is such is the truth; also from the signification of “to hurt,” as being to do injury to these. That the internal or spiritual sense of the Word in respect to good and in respect to truth is what is here signified in particular by “oil and"

The latter are interior goods and truths, but the former exterior. [2] That there are interior and exterior goods and truths, the former in the spiritual or internal man, the latter in the natural or external, can be seen from what is said and shown in the work on Heaven and Hell, namely, that there are three heavens, and that the inmost or third heaven is in inmost goods and truths, or in those of the third degree; and the middle or second heaven in lower goods and truths, or in those of the second degree; and the ultimate or first heaven is in ultimate goods and truths, that is, in those of the first degree. Ultimate goods and truths or those of the first degree are such as are contained in the sense of the letter of the Word; consequently those who remain in that sense and from it frame doctrine for themselves and live according to such doctrine, are in ultimate goods and truths. These do not see interior things, because they are not purely spiritual, like the angels of the higher heavens, but spiritual-natural; yet they are in heaven, although in the ultimate heaven, since the goods and truths that they have derived from the sense of the letter of the Word, and which are with then, contain in them interior goods and truths belonging to the spiritual sense of the Word, for the two correspond and by correspondence make a one. [3] For example: he that believes from the sense of the letter of the Word that God is angry, that He condemns and casts into hell those who live ill, although this is in itself not true, since God is never angry, and never condemns man or casts him into hell, yet with those who live well and who so believe because the Word in"

Take as another example, one who believes that he will enjoy a long life if he loves father and mother, according to the commandment of the Decalogue, if he loves them for this reason, and lives well, he is accepted just the same as if he had believed the truth itself, for he does not know that “father and mother” mean in the highest sense the Lord and His kingdom, “father” the Lord, and “mother” His kingdom, and that “prolongation of days” or “length of life” signifies happiness to eternity. It is the same in a thousand other instances. This has been said that it may be known what is meant by the exterior goods and truths and by the interior goods and truths of the Word, since “wheat and barley” signify exterior goods and truths, that is, those that are of the sense of the letter of the Word; while “oil and wine” signify interior goods and truths, that is, those that are of the spiritual sense of the Word. 375b. [4] “Wheat and barley” signify exterior goods and truths, or the goods and truths of the sense of the letter of the Word, because they are the harvest of the field and do not serve for food until made into bread, and “bread” in the Word signifies interior goods; consequently “wheat and barley” signify such things as these goods are made out of, that is, the goods and truths of the sense of the letter of the Word. But that “oil and wine” signify interior goods, which are the goods of the internal or spiritual sense of the Word, can be seen from their signification in the Word, as will be evident from what follows. It is said that these “must not be hurt,” because they are not to be profaned; for they would be profaned if they were known and were believed and were afterwards denied, or also if the life were contrary to them; and to profane interior goods and truths is to conjoin oneself with heaven and with hell at the same time, which is a total destruction of spiritual life. For not only do such goods and truths as are believed remain, but also the evils and falsities that succeed in their place by denial or by a life contrary to them; thence there is a conjunction of the good and truth that are of heaven with the evils and falsities that are of hell, and the two cannot be separated, but must be torn asunder, and"

In consequence of this, profaners, after death, are not spirits in a human form as others are, but they are mere phantoms, and seem to themselves to fly hither and thither without any thought; and at length they are separated from others and cast down into the lowest hell of all; and as they do not appear in a human form like the other spirits, they are no longer called he or she, but it, that is, not man. (But more may be seen on the profanation of good and truth in the Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, n. 169, 172.) 375c. [5] Because such a lot awaits those who profane the interior goods and truths of heaven and the church, therefore the internal or spiritual sense of the Word, in which these are contained, was not opened to the Jews, since if it had been opened they would have profaned it; neither was it opened to Christians, since they also if it had been opened would have profaned it; and for this reason it has been hidden from both Jews and Christians that there is any internal or spiritual sense within the sense of the letter of the Word, which is the natural sense; and that they might remain ignorant of it, it was provided that the knowledge of correspondences, which was the chief knowledge of the ancients, should be lost so entirely that it should be unknown what correspondence is, and therefore what the spiritual sense of the Word is. For the Word is written by pure correspondences, therefore without a knowledge of correspondences it could not be known what the internal sense is. This was provided by the Lord lest the genuine goods and truths themselves, in which the higher heavens are, should be profaned. [6] But the internal or spiritual sense of the Word is at this day opened, because the last judgment has been accomplished, and therefore all things in the heavens and in the hells have been reduced to order, and thus the Lord can provide that no profanations take place. That the internal or spiritual sense of the Word would be opened when the last judgment had been accomplished was foretold by the Lord in Revelation (respecting which see in the small work on The White Horse).

For the Lord’s “garments” signify the Word; the “garments that were divided” the Word in the letter; the “tunic” the Word in the internal sense; and the “soldiers” those who should fight in behalf of the truths and goods of the church. (That such are signified by the “soldiers,” see above, n. 64 at the end; and that “garments” in the Word signify truths, “clothing” good, and the Lord’s “garments” Divine truth, thus the Word, see also above, n. 64, 195.) 375d. [7] That “oil” signifies the good of love, can be seen especially from the anointings among the sons of Israel, or in their church, which were effected by oil; for by oil all things of the church were inaugurated, and when they had been inaugurated they were called holy, as the altar and its vessels, the tent of meeting and all things therein, likewise those who officiated in the priesthood and their garments, and also the prophets and afterwards the kings. Anyone can see that it is not oil itself that makes holy, but it is that which is signified by “oil,” which is the good of love to the Lord from the Lord; this is signified by “oil;” consequently when persons or things were anointed, from that moment they became representative, for the oil induced a representation of the Lord and of the good of love from Him. For the good of love to the Lord from the Lord is the holy itself of heaven and the church, since through it everything Divine flows in; consequently the things of heaven and the church, which are called things spiritual, are so far holy as they are grounded in this holy. [8] The reason of the representation of holiness by oil is this: the Lord alone in respect to the Divine Human is the Anointed of Jehovah, for the Divine good itself of the Divine love was in Him from conception, and from that His Human when He was in the world was Divine truth itself, and this He then also made Divine good of the Divine love by uniting it with the Divine Itself in Himself.

This has been said that it may be known that “oil” signifies the good of love. 375e. [9] But that this may be made clearer, I will explain the particulars in order, namely: (1) In ancient times they anointed with oil the stones set up for statues; (2) Also arms of war, as bucklers and shields; (3) Afterwards, the altar and all its vessels, and the tent of meeting and all things therein; (4) And besides, those who officiated in the priesthood, and their garments; (5) Also the prophets;(6) And finally, the kings, who were therefore called “the anointed.” (7) It was also a custom commonly received to anoint themselves and others with oil, to testify gladness of mind and good will. (8) From this it is evident that “oil” in the Word signifies good; the “oil of holiness,” which was prepared for anointing those things that were to be used in worship in the church, signifying the Divine good of the Divine love; and “oil” in general, good and its enjoyment."

And he called the name of that place Bethel. And he said, If I shall come again to my father’s house in peace, this stone which I have set up for a statue shall be God’s house (28:18–22). Stones were thus anointed because “stones” signified truths, and truths without good have no spiritual life, that is, no life from the Divine; but when the stones were anointed with oil, they represented truths from good, and in the highest sense, Divine truth proceeding from the Divine good of the Lord, who is thence called “the Stone of Israel.” The stones themselves set up were called “statues,” and were accounted holy, and from this arose the use of statues among the ancients, and afterwards in their temples. As this stone then set up by Jacob was representatively sanctified, therefore Jacob called the name of the place Bethel, and said that this stone should be “God’s house,” Bethel meaning “God’s house,” and “God’s house,” signifies the church in respect to good, and in the highest sense the Lord in respect to His Divine Human (John 2:19–22). (The remainder may be seen explained in the Arcana Coelestia; and further, that statues were set up by the ancients for a sign, for a witness, and for worship, n. 3727; that at first they were holy boundaries, n. 3727; that afterwards they were used in worship, n. 4580; what they signified, n. 4580, 10643.

Arms of war were anointed because they signified truths fighting against falsities, and truths from good are what prevail against falsities, but not truths without good; therefore the arms of war represented the truths by which the Lord Himself with man fights against the falsities from evil which are from hell. (That “the arms of war” signify truths fighting against falsities, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 1758, 2686, and above, n. 131a, 367; and that “wars” in general signify spiritual combats, n. 1664, 2686, 8273, 8295; and “enemies” evils and falsities, and in general the hells, n. 2851, 8289, 9314.) [12] (3) “That they anointed the altar and all its vessels, and the tent of meeting, and all things therein,” is evident from Moses: Jehovah said to Moses, Thou shalt anoint the altar, and sanctify it (Exod. 29:36). Thou shalt make the oil of anointing of holiness, wherewith thou shalt anoint the tent of meeting, and the ark of the Testimony, and the table, and all the vessels thereof, and the lamp stand and all the vessels thereof, and the altar of incense, and the altar of burnt offering, and all the vessels thereof, and the lavers, and the base. Thus shalt thou sanctify them, that they may be holy of holies; whosoever shall touch them shall sanctify himself (Exod. 30:25–29; 40:9–11. Lev. 8:10–12; Num. 7:1). The altars and the tent of meeting, with all things therein, were anointed that they might represent the Divine and holy things of heaven and the church, consequently the holy things of worship; and these they could not have represented unless they had been inaugurated by something significative of the good of love, for it is through the good of love that the Divine enters, and through it is present; the same is true in worship, without the good of love the Divine neither enters nor is present.

Put upon Aaron the garment of holiness, and thou shalt anoint him and sanctify him, that he may minister unto Me in the priesthood; and his sons thou shalt anoint as thou didst anoint their father, and it shall be that their anointing shall be to them a priesthood of an age throughout their generations (Exod. 40:13–15). Moses poured of the oil upon Aaron’s head, and anointed him to sanctify him. And afterwards he took of the oil of anointing, and of the blood that was upon the altar, and sprinkled it upon Aaron, upon his garments, upon his sons, and upon his sons’ garments with him, and sanctified Aaron, his garments and his sons, and his sons’ garments with him (Lev. 8:12, 30). Aaron and his sons were anointed, and their very garments, that they might represent the Lord in respect to the Divine good, and as to Divine truth therefrom; Aaron, the Lord in respect to Divine good, and his sons the Lord in respect to Divine truth therefrom; and, in general, that the priesthood might represent the Lord in respect to His work of salvation. Their garments were anointed (Exod. 29:29) because “garments” represented spiritual things investing.

This is the anointing of Aaron and the anointing of his sons, out of the offerings by fire to Jehovah, which He commanded to give them in the day that He had anointed them from among the sons of Israel (Lev. 7:34–36). Jehovah spoke unto Aaron, Behold, I have given thee the charge of Mine heave offerings as to all the hallowed things of the sons of Israel; unto thee have I given them by reason of the anointing, and to thy sons, for the statute of an age. Every gift of theirs, even to every meal offering of theirs, even to every sacrifice of sin and guilt of theirs, every wave offering of the sons of Israel. All the fat of the pure oil, and all the fat of the new wine, and of the corn, the firstfruits of them, which they shall give unto Jehovah, to thee have I given them. Likewise everything devoted in Israel, every opening of the womb, thus every heave offering of things holy. Thou shalt have no inheritance in their land, neither shalt thou have any part in the midst of them; I am thy part and thine inheritance in the midst of the soils of Israel (Num. 18:8–20). From this it is evident that the anointing is a representation, since by anointing they were inaugurated to represent, also that it was signified by it that all inauguration into the holiness of heaven and the church is by means of the good of love which is from the Lord, and that the good of love is the Lord with them; because this is so, it is said that Jehovah is “his part and his inheritance.” [15] (5) “That they anointed the prophets also,” is evident from the first book of Kings: Jehovah said unto Elijah, Anoint Hazael to be king over Syria; and Jehu anoint to be king over Israel; and Elisha anoint to be prophet instead of thee (19:15, 16).

Kings were anointed that they might represent the Lord in relation to judgment from Divine truth; therefore in the Word “kings” signify Divine truths (see above, n. 31). Kings were called “the anointed of Jehovah,” and it was therefore sacrilege to do harm to them, because “anointed of Jehovah” means the Lord in respect to the Divine Human, although, in the sense of the letter the term is applied to the king anointed with oil; for the Lord, when He was in the world, in respect to His Human was the Divine truth itself, and in respect to the very esse of His life, which with man is called the soul from the father, was the Divine good itself of the Divine love; for He was conceived of Jehovah, Jehovah in the Word meaning the Divine good of the Divine love, which is the esse of the life of all; consequently the Lord alone was the Anointed of Jehovah in very essence and in very deed, since there was in Him the Divine good of the Divine love, and the Divine truth proceeding from that good itself in His Human while He was in the world (see above, n. 63, 200, 228, 328; and in The doctrine of the New Jerusalem, n. 293–295, 303-305). Moreover, earthly kings were not “the anointed of Jehovah,” but were so called because they represented the Lord, who alone was “the Anointed of Jehovah,” therefore"

But the anointing of the kings of the earth was an anointing with oil, while the anointing of the Lord in respect to the Divine Human was accomplished by the Divine good itself of the Divine love; and this is what the “oil” signified and the “anointing” represented. For this reason the Lord was called the Messiah and Christ, Messiah in the Hebrew signifying anointed, and Christ the like in Greek (John 1:41; 4:25). [17] From this it can be seen, that when “the anointed of Jehovah” is mentioned in the Word, in a representative sense the Lord is meant. As in Isaiah: The spirit of the Lord Jehovih is upon Me; therefore hath Jehovah anointed Me to preach good tidings unto the poor; He hath sent Me to bind up the broken in heart, to proclaim liberty to the captives (61:1). That the Lord in respect to the Divine Human is He whom Jehovah anointed, is evident in Luke, where the Lord openly declares it in these words: There was delivered to Jesus the book of the prophet Isaiah. And He unrolled the book, and found the place where it was written, The spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He hath anointed Me to preach good tidings to the poor; He hath sent Me to heal the broken in heart, to proclaim release to the captives, and recovery of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, to proclaim the accepted year of the Lord. After that, rolling up the book, He gave it to the minister, and sat down. But the eyes of all in the synagogue were fastened on Him. He began to say unto them, To-day hath this scripture been fulfilled in your ears (4:17–21). In Daniel: Know therefore, and perceive, that from the going forth of the Word even to the restoration and building of Jerusalem, even to Messiah the Prince, shall be seven weeks (9:25)."

[19] “The anointed of Jehovah” means the Lord also in the following passages. In David: The kings of the earth set themselves and the rulers took counsel together against Jehovah and against His anointed. I have anointed My king upon Zion, the mountain of My holiness (Ps. 2:2, 6). “The kings of the earth” are falsities, and the “rulers” are evils from the hells, against which the Lord fought when He was in the world, and which He conquered and subdued; “the anointed of Jehovah” is the Lord in respect to the Divine Human from which He fought; “Zion, the mountain of holiness upon which he is said to have been anointed as a king,” is the celestial kingdom, which is in the good of love; this kingdom is the inmost of heaven and the inmost of the church. [20] In the same: I found David My servant; with the oil of holiness have I anointed him (Ps. 89:20). “David” here as also elsewhere means the Lord (see above, n. 205); “the oil of holiness with which Jehovah anointed him” means the Divine good of the Divine love; that it is the Lord who is here"

Also I will make him the firstborn, higher than the kings of the earth. His seed will I establish for ever, and his throne as the days of the heavens (verses 19, 25–27, 29; besides other passages). In Zion will I make the horn of David to bud; I will set in order a lamp for Mine anointed. His enemies will I clothe with shame, but upon himself shall his diadem flourish (Ps. 132:17, 18). That here, too, the Lord is meant by “David” is evident from the preceding verses, where it is said: We have heard of Him in Ephrathah; we have found Him in the fields of the forest. We will go into His tabernacles; we will bow ourselves down at His footstool. Thy priests shall be clothed with righteousness, and Thy saints shall shout for joy; for Thy servant David’s sake turn not back the faces of Thine anointed (verses 6–10). From this it can be seen that the Lord in respect to His Divine Human is here meant by David, “the anointed of Jehovah.” [21] In Jeremiah: They chased us upon the mountains, they laid wait for us in the wilderness. The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of Jehovah, was captured in their pits; of whom we had said, Under his shadow we shall live among the nations (Lam. 4:19, 20). Here, also, “the anointed of Jehovah” means the Lord, for this treats of assault upon Divine truth by falsities and evils, which is the signification of “they chased us upon the mountains, and laid wait in the wilderness;” “the breath of the nostrils” means heavenly life itself which is from the Lord (Arcana Coelestia, n. 9818)."

Thus, in the first book of Samuel: David said, Jehovah forbid that I should do this word unto my lord, the anointed of Jehovah, and put forth my hand against him, for he is the anointed of Jehovah (24:6, 10). David said to Abishai, Destroy him not; for who shall put forth his hand against the anointed of Jehovah and be guiltless? (26:9). In the second book of Samuel: David said unto him who said that he had slain Saul, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thou hast said, I have put to death the anointed of Jehovah (1:16). Abishai said, Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the anointed of Jehovah? (19:21). That Shimei was therefore slain by command of Solomon (1 Kings 2:36, to the end). [23] (7) “That it was a commonly received custom to anoint themselves and others with oil, to testify gladness of mind and good will,” is evident from the following passages. In Amos: Who drink out of bowls of wine, and anoint themselves with the first fruits of oils, but they are not grieved for the breach of Joseph (6:6). In Micah: Thou shalt tread the olive, but thou shalt not anoint thee with oil (6:15); meaning, thou shalt not be glad. In Moses: Thou shalt have olive trees in all thy border, but thou shalt not anoint thee with the oil (Deut. 28:40)."

Wine gladdeneth the heart of man, to make the face bright with oil (Ps. 104:15). In Luke: Jesus said to Simon, I entered into thine house, and My head with oil thou didst not anoint; but this woman hath anointed My feet with ointment (7:44, 46). In Matthew: But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thy head, and wash thy face, that thou appear not unto men to fast (6:17, 18). [24] “To fast” signifies to mourn, because they fasted when they mourned, and as they then refrained from expressions of gladness, they also then abstained from anointing themselves with oil, as in Daniel: I Daniel was mourning three weeks; I ate not the bread of desires, neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth, neither was I anointed with anointing, until three weeks of days were fulfilled (10:2, 3).

Whosoever shall prepare any like it, or whosoever shall put any of it upon a stranger, shall be cut off from his people (Exod. 30:32, 33, 38). [25] (8) From this it is evident that “oil” in the Word signifies good; the “oil of holiness,” which was prepared for anointing the things that were used in worship in the church signifying the Divine good of the Divine love, and “oil” in general, good and its enjoyment, as can be seen from other passages in the Word where “oil” is mentioned, as from the following. [26] In David: Behold how good and how lovely it is for brethren to dwell together! It is like the good oil upon Aaron’s head, that cometh down upon the beard, Aaron’s beard; that cometh down upon the hem of his garments; like the dew of Hermon that cometh down upon the mountains of Zion; there Jehovah hath commanded the blessing of life even to eternity (Ps. 133). What these words signify no one can know unless he knows what is signified by “brethren,” by “the oil upon Aaron’s head,” by “his beard,” and “the hem of his garments,” and by “the dew of Hermon,” and “the mountains of Zion.” “Brethren” here signify good and truth, for these are called “brethren” in the Word; therefore “Behold how good and how lovely it is for brethren to dwell together” signifies that in the conjunction of good and truth is every heavenly good and delight, for every heavenly good and delight is from the conjunction of good and truth. “The oil upon the head that cometh down upon the beard, Aaron’s beard, that cometh down upon the hem of his garments,” signifies that from that conjunction is the good and delight of heaven, from inmosts"

Thou didst eat fine flour, honey, and oil, whence thou didst become exceeding beautiful, and didst prosper even to a kingdom (16:8–10, 13). These things are said of “Jerusalem,” which signifies the church, therefore these particulars signify the spiritual things pertaining to the church. These things evidently were not said of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, namely, that Jehovah “washed them with waters,” “washed away their bloods” “clothed them with broidered work, and shod them with badgers skins;” but “to wash with waters”"

In the spiritual sense these things are thus perceived: “the Samaritan” means the Gentiles that were in the good of charity towards the neighbor; “the man wounded by thieves” means those who are infested by those from hell, who are thieves because they injure and destroy man’s spiritual life; the “oil and wine that he poured into his wounds” mean things spiritual that heal man, “oil” good, and “wine” truth; that “he set him on his own beast” signifies that he did this according to his intelligence so far as he was able, “horse,” and likewise “beast of burden,” signifying the intellect; that “he brought him to an inn and told them to care for him” signifies to bring to those that are well instructed in the doctrine of the church from the Word, and who are better able to heal him than one who is still in ignorance.

It has thus far been shown that “oil” signifies celestial good, which is the good of love to the Lord; it shall now be shown that “wine” signifies spiritual good, which is the good of charity towards the neighbor and the good of faith; and as this good in its essence is truth, it is said in the general explanation that “the oil and the wine hurt not,” which signifies that there must no harm be done to the internal or spiritual sense of the Word in respect either to good or to truth, or what is the same, that there must no harm he done to the goods and truths which are in the internal or spiritual sense of the Word. The good of charity and the good of faith in their essence are truth, because that good is implanted by the Lord in man’s intellectual part by means of the truths that are called the truths of faith, and when man lives according to these truths they become goods; for by means of truths a new will is formed in that part, and whatever proceeds from the will is called good. This will, moreover, is the same as conscience, and conscience is a conscience of truth, for it is formed by truths of every kind from the doctrine of the church, and from the sense of the letter of the Word (but on this subject see further in the Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, n. 130–138; and the extracts from the Arcana Coelestia, in. n. 139–141). From this now it is that “wine” signifies truth. [2] Furthermore, there are goods and truths internal and external; internal goods and truths are signified by “the oil and the wine” that must not be hurt; but external goods and truths are signified by “wheat and barley.” External goods and truths are those that are"

These goods and truths are genuine goods and truths themselves, but the former are truths and goods because they correspond, thus are correspondences; internal goods and truths have immediate communication with the angels of heaven, while external goods and truths have not an immediate but a mediate communication through correspondences. This is why the Jews, because they were only in the sense of the letter and had no knowledge of the signification of things in the spiritual sense, were unable to do harm to the spiritual sense in respect either to good or to truth, and consequently were unable to do harm to genuine goods and truths. So the Christian church at this day is unable to do harm to the genuine goods and truths which are in the spiritual sense of the Word, for it has been ignorant of that sense, and at the same time ignorant of genuine goods and truths. [3] The spiritual sense of the Word was not disclosed to Christians, because genuine goods and truths, such as are in the higher heavens, lie concealed in the spiritual sense of the Word; and so long as these goods and truths were unperceived and unknown that sense could not be opened, since these goods and truths could not be seen. In the Christian churches genuine goods and truths have not been perceived and known for the reason that those churches have been divided, in general, into the Papal and the Evangelical; and those in the Papal church are utterly ignorant of truths, because they do not depend upon the Word, thus upon the Lord who is the Word, that is, Divine truth, but upon the pope, from whose mouth scarcely anything proceeds except what is from the love of ruling, and that love is from hell; therefore with them scarcely a single truth of the church exists; while in the Evangelical churches faith alone has been assumed as the essential means of salvation, and as a consequence the good of love and charity has been rejected as non-essential, and where good is"

This is why the spiritual sense of the Word could not be disclosed to the Christian churches, for if it had been disclosed, they would have falsified and perverted it by ideas from fallacies, and thus would have profaned it. This also is why no one will ever hereafter be admitted into the spiritual sense of the Word unless he is in genuine truths from good, and no one can be in genuine truths from good unless in heart he acknowledges the Lord alone as the God of heaven and earth, for from Him is every good and thence every truth. The spiritual sense of the Word is at this day opened, and therewith also genuine truths and goods are disclosed, because the last judgment has been accomplished by the Lord, and thus all things in the heavens and in the hells have been reduced to order; and for this reason it can be provided by the Lord that no harm can be done to genuine truths and goods, which are in the spiritual sense of the Word, and this could not have been provided before (see in the small work on the Last Judgment, n. 73). 376b. [4] That “wine” signifies spiritual good, or the good of charity and the good of faith, which in its essence is truth, can be seen from the following passages in the Word. In Isaiah: Ho, everyone that thirsteth, come ye to the waters; and he that hath no silver; come ye, buy and eat; buy wine and milk without silver and without price (55:1). Anyone can see that this does not mean that wine and milk may be bought without silver, “wine and milk” therefore signify things spiritual, namely, “wine” spiritual good, which in its essence is truth, as was said above, but “milk” the good of that truth. That these are given by the Lord freely to those who are ignorant of truth and good, and yet in a desire for these, is signified by “he that"

[5] In Joel: It shall come to pass in that day, the mountains shall drop down sweet wine, and the hills shall flow with milk; all the water courses of Judah shall flow with waters (3:18). This treats of the Lord’s coming, and of the new heaven and the new church from Him. It is well known that the mountains in the land of Canaan, or in Judea, did not then drop down sweet wine, nor the hills flow with milk, nor the water courses of Judah flow with waters more than before, therefore these words must mean something else than new wine, milk, and waters, or than mountains, hills, and water courses, namely, “that the mountains shall drop down sweet wine” (mustum) or wine (vinum), means that from the good of love to the Lord there shall be genuine truth; “the hills shall flow with milk” means that from the good of charity towards the neighbor there shall be spiritual life; and “all the water courses of Judah shall flow with waters” means that from the particulars of the Word there shall be truths.

This chapter treats first of the vastation of the church, and then of its restoration by the Lord; and “the people Israel” do not mean that people, but those with whom the church was to be established; and “the ploughman shall overtake the reaper, and the treader of grapes him that draweth forth the seed,” signifies that he who receives good and truth shall also perform uses, or bear fruit, thus that with the man of the church the two shall be present at the same time; “the mountains shall drop down sweet wine, and all the hills shall dissolve,” signifies, as just above, that from the good of love to the Lord and from the good of charity towards the neighbor there shall be truths in abundance, “sweet wine” here, or “wine,” meaning truth; that “the captivity of the people Israel shall be brought back” signifies the restoration of the church among the Gentiles, for “captivity” means spiritual captivity, in which those are who are remote from goods and truths, and yet in a desire for them (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 9164). “The waste cities that they shall build” signify the doctrinals of truth and good from the Word, before destroyed and at that time to be restored; “the vineyards which they shall plant,” and “the wine of which they shall drink,” signify all things of the church from which there is intelligence, “a vineyard” signifies the spiritual church, and therefore “vineyards” signify all things of the church; “wine” signifies the truth of the church in general, and “to drink it” signifies to be instructed and become intelligent, thus intelligence; and “the gardens which they shall make, and the fruit of which they shall eat,” signifies wisdom, “gardens” meaning all things of intelligence, and their “fruit” signifying the goods of life, thus “to eat their fruit” signifies the appropriation of good, thus wisdom, for wisdom comes when truths are committed to the life; and because this is what is meant, therefore it is said of Israel, “I will plant them upon their ground.”"

This is in the prophecy of Israel the father respecting Judah, by whom here Judah is not meant, but the Lord in relation to the celestial kingdom; and “wine” and the “blood of grapes” mean the Divine truth.

Those who do not know that the Word is spiritual in its particulars may suppose that by “Isaac” here is meant Isaac, and by “Jacob” Jacob, and therefore that by “the fatnesses of the earth,” and “the corn and new wine,” no other and deeper things are meant; but “Isaac” here represents the Lord, and “Jacob” the church; thence the “fatnesses of the earth” mean the celestial things that are of the good of love; and “corn and new wine” every good and truth of the church.

The blessings of heaven, to which the blessings of the earth correspond, all have reference to the things that are of the good of love and the truth of faith; these blessings therefore are signified by “the former rain and the latter rain,” for “rain” in particular signifies Divine truth flowing in out of heaven, from which all things of the church and heaven with man are born, grow, and are brought forth; therefore “the coin, new wine, and oil, which they should gather in,” signify every good and truth of the external and internal man.

In Isaiah: Jehovah hath sworn by His right hand, and by the arm of His strength, Surely I will no longer give thy corn to be food for thine enemies, and the sons of the alien shall not drink thy new wine for which thou hast labored; but they that gather it shall eat it and praise Jehovah, and they that bring it together shall drink it in the courts of holiness (62:8, 9).

That goods and truths will remain with those who receive them, and thence make use of them, is signified by “they that gather it shall eat it,” and “they that bring it together shall drink it;” worship from these is signified by “praising Jehovah,” and “drinking in the courts of holiness.”"

This describes the taking away of the heavenly enjoyment that is from good and its truths, because good and truth itself is taken away; the good of the church is meant by “Carmel,” and its truths by “vineyards” and by “treading out the wine in the wine vats;” the enjoyments thereof that are taken away are meant by “gladness” “exultation,” “singing aloud,” “shouting,” and “vintage-shouting,” for it was a custom to sing in the vineyards, and in the wine presses when the grape was trodden into wine, that enjoyments from truths, which were signified by “wine,” might be represented. [14] In Jeremiah: With more than the weeping of Jazer I will weep for thee, O vine of Sibmah; thy shoots are passed over the sea, they reach even to the sea of Jazer; upon thy autumn fruits, and upon thy vintage the devastator is fallen.

This also treats of the taking away of the heavenly enjoyment that is from the good of love and the truths thence, for all heavenly enjoyment is in these and from these. Lamentation over it is meant by “weeping” (flere fletum); deprivation of it is meant by “gladness and exultation is gathered out of Carmel,” likewise by “the devastator falling upon it,” “the wine failing,” and “the shouting being no shouting;” the good that was taken away, for which there was lamentation, is meant by “the autumn fruits;” and the truths of good that were taken away are meant by “the vintage,” and by “the wine in the wine vats.” That truths were banished, and that they perished through knowledges is meant by “the vine of Sibmah,” and by its “shoots that have gone over the sea, even to the sea of Jazer,” “sea” signifying the knowing faculty."

[25] Because “wine” signified the truth of the church that is from good, it was commanded that, with the sacrifices upon the altar, a meal offering and a drink offering should be offered, and the meal offering was bread, and the drink offering wine; these signified worship of the Lord from the good of love, and from the truths therefrom; for all worship is from these. (On the drink offerings, the portions of wine with them at the different sacrifices, see Exod. 29:40, 41; Lev. 23:13, 18; Num. 6:1–4, 15, 17; 15:4–7, 10, 24; 28:7–10, 24, 31; 29:6, 11, 16, 19, 22, 25, 27, 28, 31, 34, 38, 39; and besides Gen. 35:14.) This makes clear what is signified in Joel: The meal offering and the drink offering was cut off from the house of Jehovah; the priests, the ministers (of the altar), mourned (1:9); namely, that worship from the good of love, and from the truths therefrom, had perished. Who cannot see that the meal offering and the drink offering, which were bread and wine, were not pleasing to Jehovah in worship, unless they had signified such things as are of heaven and the church? [26] From this it can now be seen what the bread and wine in the Holy Supper involve, namely, the bread, the good of love to the Lord from the Lord, and the wine, the good of faith, which in its"

Because “wine” signifies the good of faith, which in its essence is truth, when the Lord instituted the sacrament of the supper, He said: I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this product of the vine until that day when I will drink it with you new in My Father’s kingdom (Matt. 26:29). I say unto you, I will not drink of the product of the vine until the kingdom of God shall come (Luke 22:18). “The product of the vine,” that is, “wine,” which the Lord “would drink with them new in His Father’s kingdom,” or “when the kingdom of God should come,” means that all Divine truth in heaven and the church would then be from His Divine Human; He therefore calls it “new,” and also He calls it “the New Testament in His blood” (verse 20); for “the Lord’s blood” has a like signification as “wine” (see above, n. 30, 328,a-c, 329a, b). And as everything Divine, since the Lord has risen, proceeds from Him, He says that He will drink it with them when the kingdom of God shall come, and it came when He reduced all things to order in the heavens and in the hells. That the kingdom of God came at the same time with the Lord, and that it is from Him can be seen from Matt. 3:2; 4:8; 10:7; 12:28; 16:28; Mark 1:14, 15; 9:1; Luke 1:32, 33; 9:11, 27, 60; 10:11; 16:16; 17:20, 21; 23:42, 51; John 18:36. Now, because “bread” signifies the good of love, and “wine” the good of faith, which in its essence is the truth from that good, and in the highest sense, “bread” signifies the Lord in respect to Divine good, and “wine” the Lord in respect to Divine truth, and because there is a correspondence between spiritual things and natural, (and such a correspondence that when “bread” and “wine” are in man’s thought, the good of love and the good of faith are in the angel’s thoughts), and because all things of heaven and the church have reference to the good of love and the good of faith, therefore the Lord instituted the Holy Supper in order that by means of it there might be a conjunction of the angels of heaven with the men of the church."

And he blessed Abram (Gen. 14:18, 19). “Melchizedek” here represents the Lord in relation to Divine good and in relation to Divine truth, as priest in relation to Divine good, and as king to Divine truth; therefore he “brought out bread and wine,” “bread” signifying Divine good, and “wine” Divine truth; or when applied to man, “bread” signifying the good of love to the Lord, and “wine” the good of faith, which is from the reception of Divine truth. [28] The “wine” spoken of by the Lord in the following passages has a like signification: They do not put new wine into old wine skins, else the skins burst, and the wine is spilled; but they put [new] wine into fresh wine skins, and both are preserved (Matt. 9:17). And no man having drunk old wine straightway desireth new; for he saith, The old is more useful (Luke 5:39). This comparison, like all others in the Word, is from correspondences, “wine” signifying truth, “old wine” the truth of the old or Jewish church, and “wine skins” things that contain, “old wine skins” the statutes and judgments of the Jewish church, and “fresh wine skins” the percepts and commandments of the Lord. That the statutes and judgments of the Jewish church, which related especially to sacrifices and representative worship, are not in agreement with the truths of the Christian church is meant by “they do not put new wine into old wine skins, else the wine skins burst and the wine is spilled; but they put [new] wine into fresh wine skins, and both are preserved together.” That those who have been born and educated in the externals of the Jewish church cannot be brought immediately into the internals belonging to the"

Jesus said, Fill the water pots; and thy filled them to the brim. Then he said unto them Draw out now, and bear unto the ruler of the feast; and they bare it. While the ruler of the feast tasted the water that was made wine, he calleth the bridegroom, and saith unto him, Every man setteth on first the good wine; and when they have had enough, the inferior; thou hast kept the good wine until now (2:1–10). It should be known that all the miracles done by the Lord, as well as all the miracles by Him spoken of in the Old Testament, signified, that is, contained within them, such things as belong to heaven and the church, and that thence His miracles were Divine (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 7337, 8364, 9051). So with this miracle; here, as elsewhere in the Word, “a wedding” signifies the church; “in Cana of Galilee” means among the Gentiles; “water” the truth of the external church, such as was the truth of the Jewish church from the sense of the letter of the Word, and “wine” the truth of the internal church, such as is the truth of the Christian church; therefore the Lord’s “making the water wine” signifies that of the truths of the external church He will make truths of the internal church by opening the internal things that have lain concealed in them. “The six water pots of stone, set there according to the cleansing of the Jews,” signify all these truths in the Word, and thence in the Jewish church and its worship; these were all representative and significative of things Divine in the Lord and from the Lord, which contained things eternal. For this reason there were “six water pots of stone, set for the cleansing of the Jews;” the number “six” signifies all, and is predicated of truths; “stone” signifies truth, and “the cleansing of the Jews” purification from sins; thus all things of the Jewish church are signified, since that church regards purification from sins as its all, for so far as anyone is purified from sins, so far he becomes a church. “The ruler"

[30] It is because “wine” signifies the truth of the church, and “oil” the good of the church, that the Lord says, in the parable of the man who was wounded by thieves: That the Samaritan poured oil and wine into his wounds (Luke 10:33, 34); where “the man wounded by thieves” means those who are infested and have their conscience hurt by evil men, who are “robbers;” and “the Samaritan” means the Gentiles that are in the good of charity; therefore “his pouring into his wounds oil and wine” signifies the spiritual things that heal a man thus injured, “oil” meaning the good of love, and “wine” the good of faith, or truth. What the rest signifies, namely, “that he set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and told them to take care of him,” may be seen above (n. 375e [8]), where they are explained. That “wine” signifies the truth of the church can be seen not only from the passages cited, but also from others in the Word (as Isa. 1:21, 22; 25:6; 36:17; Hos. 7:4, 5, 14; 14:5–7; Amos 2:8; Zech. 9:15, 17; Ps. 104:14–16). 376f. [31] As most things in the Word have also a contrary sense, so, too, has “wine,” and in that sense it signifies truth falsified, and also falsity, as in the following passages. In Isaiah: Woe to the crown of pride, to the drunkards of Ephraim, to the flower of his fading adornment, which is on the head of the valley of the fat ones frenzied with wine; the crown of pride, the drunkards of Ephraim, they shall be trampled under the feet; these go astray through wine, and through strong drink they err; the priest and the prophet go"

This is said of those who are insane in things spiritual because they believe themselves to be intelligent of themselves, and glory in it; the state of such is here described by pure correspondences; those who are insane in things spiritual or in truths are meant by “the drunkards,” and those who thence believe themselves intelligent by “Ephraim,” and hence glorying in intelligence or learning is meant by the “crown of pride;” for those who are in falsities of doctrine and have confirmed themselves in them, when they are illustrated and see truths, in the other life become like drunkards. The learned who have confirmed themselves in falsities become such, and to confirm oneself in falsities is to confirm from oneself and not from the Lord. This makes clear what is signified by “woe to the crown of pride, to the drunkards of Ephraim;” “the flower of the fading adornment that is on the head of the valley of the fat ones frenzied with wine” signifies the truth of the church destroyed even as it is born by the glorying of the self-intelligence that is of the natural man separated from the spiritual, when falsity is seen instead of truth, “the flower of the adornment” meaning truth as it is born declining or perished; “the head of the valley of the fat ones” means the intelligence of the natural man; “frenzied with wine” means those who see falsity in place of truth; “the crown of pride, the drunkards of Ephraim, they shall be trampled under the feet,” signifies that this Intelligence shall utterly perish; “these go astray through wine, and through strong drink they err,” signifies through falsities and through such things as are from falsities; “the priest and the prophet go astray through strong drink, they are swallowed up of wine, they are gone astray through strong drink,” signifies that such are those who ought to be in the doctrine of good and truth, and in a sense abstracted from persons that such is their doctrine itself; “they go astray among the seeing, they waver in judgment,” signifies that they do not see the truths of intelligence.

These, from having no perception of good and no understanding of truth, are called “dogs strong of soul, they know not satiety,” that is, they are unable to receive good, “to know” here signifies to be able, and “satiety” reception of good, for satiety is predicated of food, by which spiritual nourishment is signified. That they have no understanding of truth is meant by “they are shepherds who know not intelligence;” those are called “shepherds” who believe themselves able to instruct others, for “to feed” means to instruct; and because such persons love falsities and things falsified, it is added, “Come, I will take wine, and we will be drunk with strong drink.” [34] In Jeremiah: Thus said Jehovah, God of Israel, Every bottle shall be filled with wine.

It is said the evil of life and the falsity therefrom, because where there is the evil of life there also is falsity, for these make one in man’s spirit; it is said in man’s spirit, because an evil man equally with a good man can do good and speak truth; but an evil man does this merely from the natural man and thence from the body, while within him, that is, in his spirit, there is no will of good and thus no understanding of truth, therefore neither"

This is what is here meant by “the pale horse.” That “a horse” signifies the understanding may be seen above (n. 355); here the understanding of the Word, because “he that sat upon the horse” signifies the Word (n. 373). [2] “Pale” signifies the evil of life and the falsity therefrom, thus “the pale horse” the understanding of the Word become nought in consequence of evils of life and of the falsities therefrom, because paleness indicates and thence signifies the absence of life or deprivation of life, here absence and deprivation of spiritual life, which occurs when there is the evil of life in place of the good of life, and the falsity of faith in place of the truth of faith, for there is then no spiritual life. Spiritual life means the life of heaven, and in the Word this also is called simply “life;” but life not spiritual is such a life as those have who are in hell, and this in the Word is also called “death.” That “the pale horse” signifies spiritual death is evident, too, from the rest of this verse, for it is said, “he that sat upon this horse his name was Death, and Hell followed with him.” [3] “Paleness” or “pale” has a like meaning in Jeremiah: Ask ye, I pray, and see whether a male doth bring forth? wherefore do I see every man with his hands on his loins as one bringing forth, and all faces are turned into paleness? (30:6). No one can know what these words involve unless he knows the signification of “bringing forth,” “male,” “man” (vir), “hands on the loins,” and “faces.” This is said of those who wish to acquire for themselves love and faith from self-intelligence; to acquire these for oneself is signified by “bringing forth;” “male” and “man” signify intelligence, here self-intelligence; “hands on the loins” signifies hatching these out, and “faces” signify love and faith; for angels and spirits have faces such as their love and faith are, for the auction of good, which is love, and the affection of truth, which is faith, manifest themselves in their faces; therefore “whether a male doth bring forth” signifies whether anyone can acquire for himself the"

This is signified by “paleness of the face.” (That “conceptions,” “travailings,” and “births,” in the Word signify spiritual conceptions, travailings, and births which are of love and faith, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 3860, 3868, 3915, 3919, 3965, 9325; that the “male” or “masculine” signifies truth, and intelligence therefrom, n. 749, 2046, 4005, 7838; likewise “man,” n. 749, 1007, 3134, 3309, 3459, 9007; that “the face” signifies the interiors of the mind, thus the things of love and faith, n. 1999, 2434, 3527, 4066, 4796 5102, 9306, 9546; that the faces with angels are the forms of their affections, all in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 47, 457, 459, 481, 552, 553.) [4] “To wax pale” has a like meaning in Isaiah: Jacob shall not be ashamed, neither shall his face wax pale (29:22). “Jacob” means those who are of the church, and “his face shall not wax pale” means that such shall not be in evils and falsities, but in goods and truths. “Paleness” signifies privation of spiritual life, which occurs when there is no good and truth, but evil and falsity, because when man is deprived of vital heat he then waxes pale and becomes an image of death, as is the case in extreme terrors, the same as when he dies; but when a man dies spiritually his face either becomes red like a coal fire or pale like that of a corpse; thus the infernals appear in the light of heaven. 382. And he that sat upon him, signifies the Word. This is evident from what has been said and shown above (n. 373). Its being said that “his name was Death” does not mean that the Word in itself is death, but only before those who are in evils and falsities therefrom, for such persons see and perceive in the Word nothing of truth and good, thus nothing of spiritual life; consequently before such as these it is according to appearance and perception that his name"

It is similar with the Lord Himself, who is the Word He too appears to everyone according to his quality; to those who are in goods and truths therefrom He appears as a fire and as light vivifying and recreating, but to those who are in evils and in falsities therefrom He appears as a consuming fire and as thick darkness (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 934 end, 1861 end, 6832, 8814, 8819, 9434, 10551). And for the same reason to those who are in evil and in falsities therefrom the Lord appears to be angry, to punish, to condemn, and to cast into hell, when yet He is never angry, never punishes, or condemns, or cast into hell, but saves so far as man applies himself; for the Lord is good itself and truth itself, He is love itself and mercy itself. The like is true of this passage, where it is said that the name of the one that sat on the pale horse is “Death.” (On this more may be seen cited above, n. 373.) 383. His name was Death, and hell followed with him, signifies eternal damnation. This is evident from the signification of “name,” as being the quality of a thing (see above, n. 102, 148), here the quality of the Word with those who are in evils and in falsities therefrom; also from the signification of “death,” as being damnation (of which also see above, n. 186), for spiritual death is nothing else; also from the signification of “hell,” as being evil and falsity therefrom, since in these and from these hell exists. Moreover, “hell” has the same signification as “death,” namely, damnation; but as both are here mentioned, and thus hell is distinguished from death, “hell” signifies eternal damnation, for those who come into hell remain there to eternity; therefore it is also said, “and hell followed with him,” “to follow with him” signifying to abide therein, namely, in damnation to eternity. From this it can be seen that “his name was Death, and hell followed with him” signifies eternal damnation. 384.

This is evident from the signification of “power,” as being effect, since to be able means to effect; from the signification of “to kill” or “to slay,” as being to deprive of good and truth (of which above, n. 366); from the signification of “fourth part,” as being every good and thence every truth (of which presently); and from the signification of “earth,” as being the church and everything thereof (of which above, n. 29, 304). And as a church is a church from doctrine there, and from life according to it, and as every doctrine of the church must be from the Word, so the doctrine of the church from the Word is at the same time signified. From this it can be seen that “there was given unto them power over the fourth part of the earth to kill” signifies the deprivation of every good and thus of every truth from the Word, and in consequence in the doctrine of the church from the Word. It is said that “power was given unto them,” meaning to evils and to falsities therefrom, and these are signified also by “death and hell.” That those who are in evils and falsities deprive themselves of all the perception of good and the understanding of truth from the Word, and in consequence in the doctrine of their church from the Word, is clearly evident in the case of those who are in falsities of doctrine from evils of life. Such, although they read the Word, either do not see the truths that are in it or they falsify them by applying them to the falsities of their own opinions and to the evils of their own loves; for the sense of the letter of the Word is such that those who are in good see truths in it, and those who are in evil see falsities, for the sense of the letter is according to the apprehension of little children, boys, and the simple, and is therefore according to appearance; but still in that sense truths lie hidden that are not seen by any except those who are in good, those who are in evil not wishing to see them, but they draw all things by perverse interpretations to the evils of their loves and to the falsities of their opinions, as is plainly evident from so many heresies existing within the church, especially the heinous Babylonian heresy, and also from the Jewish heresy.

In the Word “a third part” and also “a fourth part” are often mentioned, and those who do not know that all numbers signify things may believe that “a third part” means a third part, and “a fourth part” a fourth part, or that they signify some portion; but “a third part” signifies all truth, and “a fourth part” all good; and as all truth is from good, “a fourth part” signifies all good and the truth therefrom, here the deprivation of these, because it is said “there was given to them power over the fourth part of the earth to kill.” That “three” and thence “a third part” are predicated of truths, will be seen hereafter, where that number is mentioned. But “four” and thence “a fourth part” are predicated of goods and the truths therefrom, because they signify the conjunction of good and truth. This has been made evident to me by much experience from the spiritual world; for when angels spoke there of the conjunction of good and truth, or of love and faith, and their speech was determined into numbers, the number four was exhibited, and sometimes also the number two, or the number eight, or the number sixteen, because these numbers have a like signification, for numbers multiplied or divided have like signification as the numbers with which they are multiplied or divided (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 5291, 5335, 5708,7973). That angelic speech falls also into numbers, may be seen in the work on Heaven and Hell (n. 263). That “four” signifies the conjunction of good and truth has its origin from the four quarters in heaven, in two of which, namely, in the east and the west, those dwell who are in the good of love, and in the other two, namely, in the south and the north, those who are in truths therefrom (see in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 141–153). Consequently “the four quarters,” or “the four winds,” signify all good and the truth therefrom, and “four” their conjunction. “A fourth part” signifies everything of conjunction of good and truth, because here “a fourth” constitutes all, and “a fourth” is significative of conjunction; therefore “killing a fourth part” signifies all of conjunction, consequently every good and truth; for where no conjunction of good and truth exists, there they are not; for there can be no good without truth, nor truth without good; they are in their essence one, since truth is of good, and good is of truth (as can be seen from what is said, and the"

This is evident from the signification of “sword,” as being truth fighting against falsity and destroying it; and in a contrary sense falsity fighting against truth and destroying it (of which above, n. 131, 367). 386a. And with famine, signifies by the deprivation, lack, and ignorance of the knowledges of truth and good. This is evident from the signification of “famine,” as being the deprivation of the knowledges of truth and good, also the lack and ignorance of them. These are signified by “famine” in the Word. This is the signification of “famine” because “food and drink” signify all things that nourish and sustain spiritual life, and these in general are the knowledges of truth and good. The spiritual life itself needs nourishment and support just as much as the natural life does; so it is said to be famished when a man is deprived of these knowledges, or when they fail, or when they are unknown and yet are desired. Moreover, natural foods correspond to spiritual foods, as bread to the good of love, wine to the truths therefrom, and other foods and drinks to particular goods and truths, which have been treated of in several places before, and will be treated of in what follows. It is said that “famine” signifies (1) the deprivation of the knowledges of truth and good, (2) lack, and (3) ignorance of them, since there is deprivation with those who are in evils and in falsities therefrom; lack with those who cannot know them, because they are not in the church or in its doctrine; and ignorance with those who know that there are knowledges, and therefore desire them; these three things are signified by “famine” in the Word, as can be seen from the passages there in which “famine,” “the hungry,” “thirst,” and “the thirsty,” are mentioned. 386b. [2] (1) “That ‘famine’ signifies the deprivation of the knowledges of truth and good which exists with those who are in evils and thence in falsities,” is evident from the following passages.

Except from the internal sense no one can understand this, nor can even know what is treated of. This treats of the extinction of good by falsity, and of truth by evil. The perversion of the church through falsity is meant by “in the fury of Jehovah of Hosts is the land obscured;” and the perversion of it through evil is meant by “the people are become as the food of the fire;” “the land obscured” signifies the church where there is no truth, but only falsity; and “the food of the fire” signifies the consumption of the truth by the love of evil, “fire” meaning the love of evil. That falsity destroys good is meant by “a man shall not pity his brother,” “man” and “brother” signifying truth and good, here “man” signifies falsity, and “brother” good, because it is said that “he shall not pity him.” The consequent deprivation of all good and of all truth, however much it may be sought, is meant by “if he shall cut down on the right hand he shall be hungry, and if he shall eat on the left hand they shall not be satisfied,” “right hand” signifying good from which is truth, and “left hand” truth from good, “to cut down, and to eat these” signifies to seek, and “to be hungry and not be satisfied” means to be deprived of; that evil extinguishes all truth and falsity all good is meant by “they shall eat every man the flesh of his own arm,” “flesh of the arm” meaning the power of good through truth, “man” falsity, and “to eat” to extinguish. That thence all the will of good and the understanding of truth perishes is meant by “Manasseh shall eat Ephraim, and Ephraim Manasseh.” (That “Manasseh” means the will of good, and “Ephraim” the understanding of truth, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 3969, 5354,6222, 6234, 6238, 6267, 6296.) That this is with those who are in evils and falsities is meant by “they together against Judah;” for when the will is in good and the understanding in truth these are with Jehovah, since they are both from Him; but when the will is in evil and the understanding in falsity they are against Jehovah."

I will cause thy root to die with famine, and it shall slay thy remnant (14:29, 30). Nearly the like is meant by this in the internal sense; but here those are treated of who believe that faith is merely the interior sight of the natural man, and that they are justified and saved by such sight or faith, thus denying that the good of charity has any effect. Such as these are meant by “the Philistines,” and a collection of them by “Philistia” (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 3412, 3413, 8093, 8313). That this false principle, which is faith alone or faith separated from charity, destroys every good and truth of the church is meant by “from the serpent’s root shall come forth a basilisk,” the “serpent’s root” meaning that false principle, and “basilisk” the destruction of the good and truth of the church thereby. That reasoning from mere falsities springs from this is meant by “his fruit shall be a fiery flying serpent,” “fiery flying serpent” meaning reasoning from falsities. The deprivation of all truth and thence of all good is meant by “I will cause thy root to die with famine, and famine shall slay thy remnant,” meaning all things hatched out of that principle. That such is the meaning has been made evident also by experience itself.

Who that looks at the Word from the sense of the letter only, can see in this anything but a description of the formation of a molten image? yet he must see that there is nothing spiritual involved in such a description of the formation of a molten image; also that there is no need of saying that “he is hungry until there is no power, neither doth he drink until he is weary;” nevertheless not only here but elsewhere in many places in the Word, the formation of a religion and of the doctrine of falsity is described by “idols,” “graven images” and “molten images.” (That these signify the falsities of religion, and of doctrine originating from one’s own understanding, and from one’s own love, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 8869, 8932, 8941, 9424, 10406, 10503.)

From this it can be seen what is signified in the spiritual sense by “their not going into Egypt, and their dying then by the sword, the famine, and the pestilence,” namely, that if they became merely natural, they would be deprived of all truth and good and spiritual life; for the natural man separate from the spiritual is in falsities and evils, and thus in infernal life. (That the natural man separate from the spiritual is such, see in the Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, n. 47, 48.) Therefore it is said that if they went into Egypt “they should be for an execration and an astonishment and a reproach, neither would they see this place;” “the place they would not see” meaning the state of the spiritual man, the same as “the land of Canaan.” Like things are signified by the murmurings of the sons of Israel in the wilderness, because they so often desired to return into Egypt; therefore manna was also given to them, which signifies spiritual nourishment (Exod. 16:2, 3, 7–9, 22). [9] In Ezekiel: When I shall stretch out Mine hand against the house of Israel to break for it the staff of bread, and send famine upon it, and cut off from it man and beast; then I will cause the evil wild beast to pass through the land, and will bereave it, that it may become a desolation; then I will send my four evil judgments upon Jerusalem, sword and famine, and the evil wild beast, and pestilence, to cut off from it man and beast (14:13, 15, 21). This describes the vastation of the church; “the house of Israel” and “Jerusalem” meaning the church; “to break the staff of bread” signifies to destroy everything celestial and spiritual by which the church should be nourished, for “bread” involves everything belonging to heaven and the church, or all spiritual nourishment;"

      "text": "APOCALYPSE EXPLAINED 1043 “to cut off man and beast” signifies every spiritual and natural affection; therefore “the sword, the famine, the evil wild beast, and the pestilence,” signify the destruction of truth by falsity, of good by evil, of the affection of truth and good by the lusts arising from evil loves, and the consequent extinction of spiritual life. These are called “the four evil Judgments,” and are also meant by “the sword, famine, death, and the evil wild beast,” in this verse of Revelation. Evidently it is the vastation of the church that is thus described. [10] The three evils that are signified by “famine, sword, and pestilence” the prophet Gad also announced to David when he had numbered the people (2 Sam. 24:13). No one can know why David was threatened with these because of his numbering the people unless he knows that the people of Israel represented and thence signified the church in respect to all its truths and goods, and that “to number” signifies to know the quality thereof, and afterwards to arrange and dispose them according to it. Because no one but the Lord knows and does this, and because the man who does it deprives himself of all good and truth and of spiritual life, and because David did this representatively, therefore these three evils were offered him, one of which he might choose. Who can not see that there was nothing wrong in numbering the people, and that the evil on account of which David and the people were punished was hidden interiorly, that is, in the representatives in which the church then was? In the passages that have been cited, “famine” signifies the deprivation of the knowledges of truth and good, and the consequent loss of all truth and good. 386c. [11] (2) “That ‘famine’ signifies also the lack of knowledges with those who cannot know that because they are not in the church or in the doctrine thereof,” is evident from the following passages. In Amos: Behold, the days shall come in which I will send a famine into the land, not a famine for bread, nor a thirst for waters, but for hearing the words of Jehovah; that they may wander from sea to sea, from the north to the sunrise, they may run to and from seeking the word of Jehovah, and shall not find it. In that day shall the beautiful virgins and the youths faint for thirst (8:11–13)."

Because “famine and thirst” signify a lack of the knowledges of good and truth, therefore it is also said “in that day shall the beautiful virgins and the youths faint for thirst,” “the beautiful virgins” meaning the affections of truth from good, and “youths” the truths themselves that are from good, “the thirst for which they shall faint” meaning the lack of these. (That “virgins” signify the affections of good and truth, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 2362, 3963, 6729, 6775,6788; and “youths” the truths themselves, and intelligence, n. 7668.)

The desolation or destruction of the church from lack of the knowledges of good and truth is signified by, “My people shall be carried away for lack of knowledge.” The Divine truth that constitutes the church is signified by “glory;” that this is not, and consequently good is not, is signified by “the glory thereof shall be men of famine,” “men of famine” meaning those who are in no perception of good, and in no knowledges of truth; and that consequently there is no truth is signified by “the multitude thereof shall be parched with thirst,” “to be parched with thirst” meaning"

This treats of those who are in falsities from lack of the knowledges of truth and good, and their indignation on that account; the lack is described by “they shall look upwards, and they shall look also to the earth, but behold distress and thick darkness,” “to look upwards and to look to the earth” means to look everywhere for goods and truths; “but behold distress and thick darkness” means that these are nowhere to be found, but mere falsities only, “thick darkness” meaning dense falsity. Their indignation on this account is meant by “it shall come to pass that when they shall hunger they shall rage, and shall curse their king and their gods,” “to hunger” meaning to desire to know, “king” falsity, “the gods” the falsities of worship therefrom, and “to curse” to detest.

[17] (3) “That ‘famine’ in the Word also signifies ignorance of the knowledges of truth and good, such as are with those who know that there are knowledges and therefore desire them,” is evident from the following passages. In Matthew: Blessed are they that hunger after righteousness, for they shall be satisfied (5:6). “To hunger after righteousness” signifies to desire good, for in the Word righteousness” is predicated of good. In Luke: God hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich He hath sent empty away (1:53). “The hungry” are those who are ignorant of the knowledges of truth and good, and yet desire them; and “the rich” are those who have an abundance of them, but no desire for them. That the former are enriched is signified by “God hath filled them with good things;” and that the latter are deprived of them is signified by “The rich He hath sent away empty.” [18] In David: Behold, the eye of Jehovah is upon them that fear Him, to deliver their soul from death, and to keep then alive In famine (Ps. 33:18, 19). “Those that fear Jehovah” mean those who love to do His commandments; “to deliver the soul from death” signifies from evils and falsities, and thus from damnation; and “to keep them alive in famine” signifies to give spiritual life according to desire.

In the same: There is no want to them that fear Jehovah. The young lions shall lack, and suffer hunger; but they that seek Jehovah shall not want any good (Ps. 34:9, 10). Here, too, “those that fear Jehovah to whom there is no want,” signify those who love to do the Lord’s commandments; and “they that seek Jehovah who shall not want any good,” signify those who in consequence are loved by the Lord, and receive truths and goods from Him. “The young lions that lack and suffer hunger”, signify those who have knowledge and wisdom from themselves, “to lack and suffer hunger” meaning that they have neither truth nor good.

Charity towards those that are in ignorance and at the same time in a desire to know truths is meant by “If thou shalt draw out thy soul to the hungry,” “the hungry” meaning those who desire, and “the soul” is the understanding of truth instructing.

Here evidently “to hunger” is to come to the Lord, and “to thirst” is to believe on Him; to come to the Lord is to do His commandments. [28] This signification of “hungering and thirsting” makes evident also the signification of the Lord’s words in Matthew: The king said to them on the right hand, I was an hungered, and ye gave Me to eat, I was thirsty and ye gave Me to drink, I was a sojourner and ye took Me in. And He said to them on the left hand, that He was an hungered and they gave Him not to eat, and He was thirsty and they gave Him not to drink; that He was a sojourner and they took Him not in (25:34, 35, 37, 41–44). “To hunger and to thirst” signifies to be in ignorance and in spiritual want, and “to give to eat and drink” signifies to instruct and to illustrate from spiritual affection or charity; it is therefore also said, “I was a sojourner and ye took Me not in,” “sojourner” signifying those who are out of “the church, but who wish to be instructed and to receive the doctrinals of the church and to live according to them (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 1463, 4444, 7908, 8007, 8013, 9196). 386e.

[29] That He hungered we read in Mark: When they were come from Bethany, Jesus hungered; and seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, He came, if haply He might find anything thereon; but when He had come to it He found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs. Therefore He said unto it, No one eat any fruit of thee for ever. And the disciples in the morning as they passed by, saw the fig tree dried up from the roots (11:12–14, 20; Matt. 21:19, 20)."

That there was no natural good in that church, because nothing spiritual, but only some truths from the sense of the letter of the Word, is signified by “Jesus seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, came, if haply He might find anything thereon; but when He had come to it He found nothing but leaves,” “leaves” signifying the truths of the sense of the letter of the Word. That with that nation, because they were in dense falsities and in evil loves, nothing whatever of the natural good of the church would ever exist is signified by “Jesus said, No one eat any fruit of thee for ever, and the fig tree was dried up from the roots.” It is also said that “it was not the season for figs,” and this means that the church was not yet begun; that the beginning of a new church is meant by “a fig tree,” is clear from the Lord’s words (Matt. 24:32, 33; Mark 13:28, 29, and in Luke 21:28–31). From this it can be seen what “hungering” here signifies. (That “a fig tree” signifies the natural good of the church, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 217, 4231, 5113; and that “leaves” signify the truths of the natural man, see above, n. 109.)

And there had been placed a vessel full of vinegar; and they filled a sponge and placed it upon hyssop, and put it to His mouth. And when Jesus had received the vinegar He said, It is finished (19:28–30). Those who think of these things only naturally and not spiritually may believe that they involve nothing more than that the Lord thirsted, and that vinegar was then given Him; but it was because all things that the Scriptures said of Him were then finished, and because He came into the world to save mankind that He said, “I thirst,” which means that from Divine love He willed and desired the salvation of the human race; and that “vinegar was given Him” signifies that in the coming church there would be no genuine"

Let them be examined and considered, and it will be seen by those who are in any interior thought that natural famine, hunger, and thirst, can by no means be meant, but spiritual famine, hunger, and thirst. 387. And with death, signifies the consequent extinction of spiritual life. This is evident from the signification of “death,” as being the extinction of spiritual life (see above, n. 78, 186). That this is what “death” here signifies is evident from the series of things in the internal sense; for it is said that “there was given unto them power to kill with sword, with famine, and with death;” and “sword” signifies falsity destroying truth, “famine” the deprivation of the knowledges of truth and good; thence “death” signifies the extinction of spiritual life; for where falsity reigns, and where there are no knowledges of truth and good, there is no spiritual life, for spiritual life is acquired by means of the knowledges of truth and good applied to the uses of life. For man is born into all evil and falsity from evil; he is therefore born also into an entire ignorance of all spiritual knowledges; therefore in order that he may be led away from the evils and consequent falsities into which he is born, and be led into the life of heaven and be saved, he must needs acquire the knowledges of truth and good, by means of which he can be led into spiritual life and become spiritual. From this series of things in the internal sense it is evident that “death” here signifies the extinction of spiritual life; this is meant, too, by spiritual death. 388a.

Also from the signification of “the earth,” as being the church (of which see above, n. 29, 304); and as “wild beasts” signify the evils of life, and these devastate the church with man, and “the earth” signifies the church, so the “wild beasts of the earth” signify the evils of life which devastate the church with man. It is said the church with man, because the church is in man; for the church is a church from charity and faith, and these are in man; and if these are not in him, the church is not with him. It is believed that the church is where the Word is, and where the Lord is known; but still the church consists of those only who from the heart acknowledge the Divine of the Lord, and who learn truths from the Lord by the Word and do them; others do not constitute the church. That “the wild beasts of the earth” here signify, in particular, the evils of life can be seen from the series of things in the internal sense. It is said that “there was given unto them power over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, with famine, with death, and by the wild beasts of the earth,” “sword” signifying falsity destroying truth, “famine,” the deprivation of the knowledges of truth and good, “death” the extinction of spiritual life therefore “the wild beasts of the earth” signify the evils of life, since these rule when spiritual life is extinct, for where there is no spiritual life there life is merely natural, and natural life apart from the spiritual is full of lusts from the love of self and the world, thus is infernal; therefore that life is meant by “the evil wild beast.” [2] Moreover, in respect to the evil life that is signified by “the evil wild beast,” such may be the life as well with those who lead a good moral life, if they have no spiritual life; for such do good and speak truth and practice sincerity and justice but only because of reputation, honor, gain, and the laws, thus for the sake of appearance, that they may emulate those who are spiritual, while inwardly they have no will of good and no thought of truth, and"

This is also clearly manifest when such persons become spirits, which takes place immediately after death; then the external bonds mentioned above are taken away from them, and they then rush without restraint into evils of every kind. But it is otherwise with those who have led a good moral life from a spiritual origin. (On this subject see further in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 484, 529–531, 534 and above,n. 182.) This has been said to make known what is meant by an evil life, namely, that it is not the external life that pertains to the body and has reference to the world where men are, which is called the natural world, but is the internal life that pertains to the spirit and has reference to the world where angels are, which is called the spiritual world. For in respect to his body, its gestures and speech, man is in the natural world, but in respect to his spirit, that is, in respect to thought and affection, man is in the spiritual world in fact, as the bodily sight has extension into the natural world and sweeps about there, so the sight of the spirit, which is thought from affection, has extension into the spiritual world and sweeps about there. That this is so is known to few; and it is therefore supposed that thinking evil and willing evil is of no consequence if only one does not do evil and speak evil; and yet every thought and volition affects the spirit of man and makes up his life after death. 388b. [3] That “evil wild beasts” signify the lusts and the falsities from them springing from the love of self and the world, that devastate all things of the church with man, and in a contrary sense signify also the affections of truth that vivify all things of the church, can be seen from the following passages in the Word. In Jeremiah: Go ye, gather together every wild beast of the field; come to eat. Many shepherds have destroyed My vineyard; they have trodden down My field, they have made the field of desire a wilderness of solitude (12:9, 10). This treats of the vastation of the church in respect to its truths and its goods. Vastation is described by “the shepherds have destroyed"

[4] In David: Why doth the boar out of the forest tread under foot (thy vine), and the wild beast of the fields doth feed on it (Ps. 80:13). “Vine” here signifies the same as “vineyard” above, namely, the church in respect to truth, which is called the spiritual church; its vastation by the lusts and falsities of the natural man separated from the spiritual is meant by “the boar out of the forest treadeth it under foot; “the boar ont of the forest” signifying the evil lusts of the natural man, and “the wild beast of the field” falsities. [5] In Hosea: I will lay waste her vine and her fig tree; and I will make them a forest, and the wild beast of the field shall eat them (2:12). “Vine” and “fig tree” signify the church, “vine” the internal church which is of the spiritual man, and “fig tree” the external church which is of the natural man; the vastation of both is signified by “I will lay them waste, and make them a forest; and the wild beast of"

That the church is here meant by “the vine” and “fig tree” is evident from the second verse of the same chapter, where it is said that they should plead with their mother, “for she is not my wife, and I am not her husband,” “mother” and “wife” in the Word signifying the church. [6] In Moses: By little and little I will drive out the nations, lest the land become a waste, and the wild beast of the field be multiplied against thee (Exod. 23:29, 30; Deut. 7:22). What this signifies can be seen in the Arcana Coelestia (n. 9333- 9338), namely, that “nations” signify the evils that man has, even those from inheritance; and that these with man are removed “by little and little,” since if they were removed suddenly, before good is formed in him by truths, falsities would enter which would destroy him. “The wild beasts of the field” signify the falsities springing from the delights of natural loves. [7] In the same: If ye walk in My statutes and keep My commandments and do them, I will give peace in the land, so that ye may lie down securely, and none make afraid; and I will cause the evil wild beast to cease out of the land, and the sword shall not pass through your land. But if ye do not hearken unto Me and do all My commandments, I will send among you the wild beast of the field, which shall bereave you of your children, and cut off your cattle, and make you few in number, that your ways may be laid waste (Lev. 26:3, 6, 14, 22)."

The life of charity is meant by “walking in the statutes and keeping the commandments and doing them,” for this is charity; the state of their life is described by “peace,” by “they shall lie down securely, and none make them afraid,” which signifies blessedness of heart and soul arising from the conjunction of good and truth, whence there is no longer any combat of evil and falsity against good and truth. It is also described by “I will cause the evil beast to cease out of the land, and the sword shall not pass through it,” which signifies that there will no longer be any lusts or falsities springing from the love of self and the world, “the evil wild beast” signifying the lusts that destroy good affections, and “the sword” signifying the falsities that destroy truths. That those who are not in charity are in a contrary state is described by “if ye do not hearken unto Me and do all thy commandments, I will send among you the wild beast of the field, which shall bereave you of your children, and cut off your cattle, and make you few in number, that your ways may be laid waste,” which signifies that by lusts and falsities from them they shall be deprived of every good and truth. The lusts and falsities therefrom that will deprive are signified by “the wild beasts of the field that shall bereave you of your children;” the good affections of which they will be deprived are signified by “the cattle that shall be destroyed,” and the truths themselves therefrom by their “ways” that shall be laid waste, “ways” meaning the truths that lead to good.

This treats of the vastation of good by falsity, “a bear bereaved of her whelps” signifying the power of evil from falsity, and “a fierce lion” the power of falsity from evil, and “the wild beast of the field” lusts and falsities; destruction by these is signified by “the wild beast shall cleave them asunder;” the separation of truth from good by falsity and evil is signified by “rending the caul of their heart.” [10] In Isaiah: No lion shall be there, and the ravenous of the wild beasts shall not go up thither (35:9). This chapter treats of the Lord’s coming, and the state of those who are in His kingdom. “No lion shall be there” signifies that there shall be no falsity destroying truth; “the ravenous of the wild beasts shall not go up thither” signifies that there shall be no lust of destroying; it is said “shall not go up thither,” because this lust is from hell. 388c.

These are called here “the four judgments,” because man is judged by them. [21] From the explanation of these and the preceding passages the meaning of each particular here in the series can be seen. “The evil wild beast” means all ravenous beasts, such as lions, bears, tigers, panthers, wild boars, wolves, dragons, serpents, and many others, which seize and rend asunder good animals, such as lambs, sheep, bullocks, oxen, and the like. That such wild beasts, and in general, “the evil wild beast,” signify lusts springing from the love of self and the world, from which are all the evils of life and the falsities of doctrine, is from correspondence, as can be seen from the appearances in the spiritual world. There all lusts of evil and of falsity appear as wild beasts of various kinds; moreover, those from whom such appearances spring are like wild beasts, for their highest delight is to attack and destroy the good. This delight is an infernal delight, and is inherent in the loves of self and of the world, in which the hells are. From this it can be seen why it is that “the evil wild beast” in general signifies the evils of life, or lusts and the falsities therefrom springing from the loves of self and of the world, which lay waste all things of the church with man. 388e. [22] Hitherto it has been shown from the Word that “wild beasts” signify evil lusts and falsities, in particular, the lusts of ravaging and destroying goods and truths, thus the spiritual life of man, by means of falsities. It shall now be shown that “wild beasts” in the Word also signify the affections of truth and good, which are contrary to the affections of falsity from evil, which are called lusts. “Wild beasts” signify also in the Word the affections of truth and good, because the word in the original by which they are designated and called signifies life, for in that language a “wild beast” is called chayah, and chayah means life, and the life itself of the spiritual man is in the affection of truth and good; so when"

But when “wild beast” is spoken of in this sense, the idea that adheres to the word fera in the Latin must be entirely laid aside, for in that language an idea of what is fierce and ferocious adheres to the word fera, thus an idea of something bad or evil. It is otherwise in the Hebrew tongue, in which fera means life, and in general, a living soul or animal in this sense chayah or fera cannot be called “beast,” since frequently in the Word fera and bestia are mentioned together, when fera signifies the affection of truth, and bestia the affection of good. Because fera or chayah in this contrary sense signifies the affection of truth and good, Eve, the wife of Adam, is called chavah, from that word, as is evident in Moses: And the Man called his wife’s name Eve (chavah), because she was to be the mother of all chay, that is living (Gen. 3:20). Also “the four animals” that were cherubim, are called from the same word, chayah, in the plural; and because, as was said, the idea of fierce and ferocious adheres to the word fera in the Latin, therefore the translators have used “living creatures” (animalia) for the cherubim which appeared as animals (see Ezek. 1:5, 13–15, 22; 10:15; and elsewhere). [23] Likewise animals that may be eaten, as lambs, sheep, she- goats; rams, kids, he-goats, heifers, oxen, cows, as also animals that are not to be eaten, are called by the common word wild beasts (ferae), and yet they are mild and useful, consequently not wild or ferocious. Thus in Moses: This is the wild beast that ye shall eat if all the beasts, among all the wild beasts that go on all four to distinguish between the wild beast that is eaten and the wild beast that is not eaten (Lev. 11:2, 27, 47).

And in David: I will take no bullock out of thy house, nor he-goats out of thy folds for sacrifice; for every wild beast of the forest is Mine, and the beasts upon the mountains of thousands. I know every fowl of the mountains and the wild beast of My fields is with Me. If I were hungry I would not tell thee, for the world is Mine and the fullness thereof. Sacrifice unto God confession (Ps. l. 9–12, 14). [24] That “wild beast” signifies the affection of truth and good can be seen further from the following passages. In Moses: In the seventh year, which is the sabbatical year, thou shalt let the land rest and shalt abandon it; that the needy of thy people may eat it, and what they leave the wild beast of the field may eat (Exod. 23:11). In the year of the Sabbath, all the produce that is in thy land shall be for food for thy beast and for the wild beast (Lev. 25:7). Here “beast and wild beast” mean lambs, sheep, she-goats, kids, rains, he-goats, bullocks, oxen, cows, horses, and asses, but not lions, bears, boars, wolves, and the like rapacious wild beasts; so here “wild beasts” mean domestic wild beasts which are useful, which signify the affections of truth and good. [25] In David: Praise Jehovah from the earth, ye whales and deeps, the wild beast and every beast, the creeping thing and the bird of wing, kings of the earth and all peoples (Ps. 148:7, 10, 11). These signify goods and truths of every kind with man, from which man worships God; and as man worships God from these, and these are not of man but of the Lord with him, it is meant that these worship God, for no one can worship God rightly from himself, but from God, that is, from the goods and truths that are of God with him. That no one of himself but only from the Lord,"

That such things are signified by these words is evident from their signification in the internal sense, and from the Word in heaven, where the Word is spiritual, because it is for the angels who are spiritual. (That the Word is also in the heavens, and there it is in its internal sense, see in the work on Haven and Hell, n. 259–261.) [26] In the same: O God, Thou makest the rain of good will to drop down; Thou shalt confirm Thine inheritance when it is weary; Thy wild beasts shall dwell therein (Ps. 68:9, 10). Here too, “wild beast,” or “animal,” stands for those who are in the affections of truth and good, or in an abstract sense, those affections themselves; for “the rain of good will which God makes to drop down,” signifies Divine truth from Divine good; “the inheritance when it is weary which God shall confirm,” signifies the church that is in Divine truth in respect to doctrine and life, “inheritance” meaning the church where these are, which is said “to be weary” from the earnest endeavor to do good; “the wild beasts that shall dwell therein,” that is, in the inheritance or church, signify the affections of truth and good. That nothing else is here meant by “wild beast,” is evident, for no rapacious wild beast, that is, no lust of falsity and evil, can dwell in the inheritance upon which God causes the rain of good will to drop down.

These things are said of a new church from the Lord; and “the wild beast of the field, the fowl of the heavens, and the creeping thing of the earth,” have the same signification as above in David (Ps. 148:7, 10, 11), where they have been explained. “Covenant” signifies conjunction; so “to make a covenant” signifies to be conjoined (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 665, 666, 1023, 1O38, 1864, 1996, 2003, 2021, 6804, 8767, 8778, 9396, 10632). For Jehovah cannot “make a covenant” or be conjoined with the affections of evil and falsity, or with the lusts that are signified by “wild beasts” in the sense first given, nor can He make a covenant with the wild beast, the fowl, and the creeping thing generally, but only with such things as are signified by these. But these things may be seen more fully explained above (n. 357d). 388f. [ 28] In Ezekiel: Speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, Behold Asshur, a cedar in Lebanon, beautiful in branch, and with shady foliage, and high in stature. The waters made him to grow great, whence his stature became higher than all the trees of the field; In his branches did all the birds of the heavens build their nests, and under his boughs every wild beast of the field brought forth; and in his shade have dwelt all the great nations; no tree in the garden of God was equal to him in beauty (31:2–9). “Pharaoh and Egypt” here signify the knowing faculty that belongs to the natural man; and “Asshur” the rational which the knowing faculty serves; the growth of this through knowledges and cognitions is described by “cedar in Lebanon,” this also signifying the rational; “the waters that made him to grow great” signify truths, and “branches” signify extension, such as pertains to the thought of the rational man. From this it can be seen what is signified by “in his branches did all the birds of the heavens build their nests; under his boughs every wild beast of the field brought forth, and in his shade have dwelt all the great nations,” namely, rational and spiritual truths of every kind, the affections of truth and goods; “the birds of the heavens” signifying the rational and"

(That “birds” signify thoughts, and things rational, intellectual, and spiritual, and thus truths, since all things of thought are either truths or falsities, see Arcana Coelestia, D. 745, 776, 866, 988, 991, 3219, 5149, 7441; that “to bring forth” signifies to multiply truths and goods, and that this is spiritual birth, n. 3860, 3868, 9325; that “nations” signify those who are in goods, and thence in an abstract sense, goods, n. 1059, 1159, 1258, 1260, 1416, 1849, 6005; and above, n. 175a, 331; that “Pharaoh” and “Egypt” signify the knowing faculty in both senses, good and evil, see n. 1164, 1165, 1186, 1462, 5700, 5702, 6015, 6651, 6679, 6683, 6692, 7296, 9340, 9391; and that “Asshur” signifies the rational in both senses, n. 119, 1186.) [29] That “Egypt” signifies the true knowing faculty (verum scientificum) and “Assyria” the rational, and that the whole of man’s rational has its birth by means of knowledges, or that these serve it, as was said above, can be seen from these words in Isaiah: In that day shall there be a highway out of Egypt into Assyria, that Assyria may come into Egypt, and Egypt into Assyria, and they shall serve (Jehovah), the Egyptians with Assyria. In that day shall Israel be a third to Egypt and to Assyria, a blessing in the midst of the land whom Jehovah of Hosts shall bless, saying, Blessed be Egypt My people, Assyria the work of My hands, and Israel Mine inheritance (19:23–25). Here “Egypt” signifies the knowing faculty, “Assyria” the rational, and “Israel” the spiritual. [30] From the passages already cited it can be seen what “bird” and “wild beast of the field” signify in Ezekiel: Thus said the Lord Jehovah, Say to the bird of every wing, and to every wild beast of the field, Assemble yourselves and come; gather yourselves from the circuit to My sacrifice that I do sacrifice for you, a great sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel, that ye may eat flesh and drink blood. Ye shall eat the flesh of the mighty and drink the blood of the princes of the earth. And ye shall eat fat to satiety, and drink blood,"

And ye shall be satiated at My table with horse and chariot, with mighty man and with every man of war. So will I give My glory among the nations (39:17–21). From the particulars here it is evident that this is said of the church to be established by the Lord among the nations; therefore “the bird of every wing, and every wild beast of the field, that are to be assembled and invited to the sacrifice,” signify all who are in the affection of truth and good, for “the flesh that they will eat” signifies the good of love, and “the blood that they will drink,” the truth from that good, and “sacrifice” the worship itself from these. But these things may be seen more fully explained above (n. 329d). [31] Sometimes in the Word, “wild beast” and “beast” are mentioned together, sometimes “wild beast” alone, and “beast” alone; and sometimes “wild beast of the earth” or “wild beast of the field;” and when “wild beast” and “beast” are mentioned together, then the affection or love of falsity and evil is signified, “the wild beast” signifying the affection or love of falsity, and “beast” the affection or love of evil; or in a contrary sense “the wild beast” the affection or love of truth, and “beast” the affection or love of good. But when “wild beast” alone, or “beast” alone is mentioned, then “a wild beast” means the affection of both falsity and evil, and in a contrary sense the affection both of truth and good; while “beast” means the affection of evil and of the falsity therefrom, and in a contrary sense, the affection of good and of the truth therefrom. Out what “beast” signifies will be seen below where it is explained. When, however, “the wild beast of the earth” is mentioned, it means a wild beast that devours animals and men; but when “the wild beast of the field” is mentioned, it means a wild beast that eats up the crops; therefore “the wild beast of the earth” signifies such things as destroy the goods of the church, and “the wild beast of the field” such things as destroy the truths of the church; for both “earth” and “field” signify the church, “earth” signifying the church from the nation and people there, and “field” the church from what is sown, or from the reception of seeds."

In the small work on the Last Judgment it has been shown that before the last judgment took place there was a semblance of heaven which is meant by “the former heaven that passed away” (Rev. 21:1) and that this heaven consisted of those who were in external worship without internal, and who therefore lived an external moral life, although they were merely natural and not spiritual. Those of whom this heaven consisted before the Last judgment were seen in the spiritual world above the earth, also upon mountains, hills, and rocks, and therefore believed themselves to be in heaven; but those of whom this heaven consisted, because they were in an external moral life only and not at the same time in an internal spiritual life, were cast down; and when these had been cast down, all those who had been preserved by the Lord, and concealed here and there, for the most part in the lower earth, were elevated and transferred to these sane places, that is, upon the mountains, hills, and rocks where the others had formerly been, and out of these a new heaven was formed. These who had been preserved and then elevated were from those in the world who had lived a life of charity, and who were in the spiritual affection of truth. The elevation of these into the places of the others I have often witnessed. It is these who are meant by “the souls of those slain seen under the altar,” and because they were guarded by the Lord in the lower earth, and this earth is under heaven, so “I saw under the altar” signifies those who were preserved under heaven. But these are particularly treated of in Revelation 20:4, 5, 12, 13, where more will be told about them; meanwhile see what is said in the small work on the Last Judgment (n. 65–72) of “the former heaven that passed away,” and “the new heaven” that was formed by the Lord after the last judgment.

And there were given to them white robes; and it was said unto them, that they should rest yet a little time, until their fellow-servants, as well as their brethren, who were to be killed, as they also were, should be fulfilled.” [2] “Under the altar” signifies under heaven, because the “altar,” in the highest sense, signifies the Lord, and in a relative sense, heaven and the church, for the Lord is heaven and the church, since everything of heaven and the church, of everything of love and faith which make heaven and the church with angel and man, are from the Lord, and thence are His; but in a general sense the “altar” signifies all worship of the Lord and especially representative worship, such as there was with the sons of Israel. “The altar” signifies all worship, because “worship” in that church consisted mainly in offering burnt-offerings and sacrifices; for these were offered for every sin and guilt, also from good will to please Jehovah (these were called eucharistic or voluntary sacrifices), also for cleansings of every kind. Moreover, by burnt-offerings and sacrifices inaugurations were also effected into everything holy of the church, as is evident from the sacrifices at the inauguration of Aaron and his sons into the priesthood, the inauguration of the tent of meeting, and afterwards of the temple. And as the worship of Jehovah, that is, of the Lord, consisted chiefly in burnt-offerings and sacrifices, these also were offered daily, namely, every morning and evening, and were called in one word “the continual,” besides a great number at every feast; so in the Word the “continual- offering” signifies all representative worship. From this it can be seen that worship, and particularly the representative worship of that nation consisted chiefly in burnt-offerings and sacrifices. For this reason the altar upon which these were made, and which contained them, signifies in the Word all worship in general. Worship means not external worship only, but also internal worship; and internal worship comprehends everything of love and everything of faith, thus everything that constitutes the church or, heaven with man, in a word, that causes the Lord to be with him."

Heaven was represented before John by an altar, for this reason also, that the whole Word was written by representatives, and by such representatives as were with the sons of Israel; in order, therefore, that the Word might be similar in both Testaments, the things in this book and that were seen by John, are like those in other parts, that is, an altar of incense was seen, the incense itself with the censers, likewise the tabernacle, the ark, and other like things. But at the present day such things never appear to any angel, or to any man whose sight is opened into heaven. The altar, the ark, and like things do not appear in heaven at the present day, because to the ancients sacrifices were wholly unknown and after the Lord’s coming they were entirely abolished. Sacrifices were begun by Eber, and were continued afterwards among his posterity, who were called Hebrews, and were tolerated among the sons of Israel who were from Eber, especially because a. worship once begun and rooted in the mind is not abolished by the Lord, but is bent to signify what is holy in religion (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 1343, 2180, 2818, 10042). [3] That “the altar” signifies, in the highest sense, the Lord’s Divine Human in relation to the Divine good of the Divine love, and that in a relative sense it signifies heaven and the church, and in general all worship, and in particular representative worship, can be seen from the following passages in the Word. In David: O send out Thy light and Thy truth, let them lead me; let them bring me unto the mountain of Thy holiness, and to Thy habitations, that I may come unto the altar of God, unto God (Ps. 43:3, 4). It is clearly evident that “the altar of God” here means the Lord in respect to the Divine Human, for these words treat of the way to heaven and to the Lord there; the way to heaven is meant by “send out Thy light and truth; let them lead me;” “light” meaning the illustration in which truths appear; heaven, into which it leads, is meant by “let them bring me unto the mountain of holiness, and to Thy habitations;” “mountain of holiness” meaning heaven where the Lords celestial kingdom is, in which the good of love reigns; while those heavens are called “habitations” where the Lord’s spiritual kingdom is, in which truth from that good reigns; and as"

In the Jewish church there were two things that, in the highest sense, signified the Lord’s Divine Human, namely, the altar and the temple; the altar, the Divine Human in relation to Divine good; the temple, in relation to Divine truth proceeding from that good. These two signified the Lord in respect to His Divine Human, be cause all things of worship in that church represented the Divine things that proceed from the Lord, called celestial and spiritual, and the worship itself was chiefly performed upon the altar and in the temple, therefore, these two represented the Lord Himself. [4] That the temple represented His Divine Human He teaches in plain terms in John: The Jews said, What sign showest Thou that Thou doest these things? Jesus answered and said, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up. But He was speaking of the temple of His body (2:18–23; also Matt. 26:61; and elsewhere). When the disciples were showing Him the buildings of temple, the Lord said: That there shall not he left stone upon stone that shall not be thrown down (Matt. 24:1, 2); signifying that the Lord was wholly denied among them, on which account also the temple was destroyed from its foundation. 391c. [5] That “the altar” also signified the Lord’s Divine Human, may be concluded from the Lord’s words in Matthew: Woe unto you, ye blind guides, for ye say, Whosoever shall swear by the temple it is nothing, but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple he is guilty.

Ye fools and blind! whether is greater, the gift or the altar that sanctifieth the gift? For he that sweareth by the altar sweareth by it and by everything thereon. And he that sweareth by the temple sweareth by it and by Him that dwelleth therein. And he that sweareth by heaven sweareth by the throne of God and by Him that sitteth thereon (23:16–22). It is here said that the temple sanctifies the gold that is in it, and that the altar sanctifies the gift that is upon it; and thus that the temple and the altar were most holy, and that all sanctification was from them; therefore “the temple” and “altar” signify the Lord in respect to the Divine Human, for from that everything holy of heaven and the church proceeds. If this is not the meaning how could the temple or the altar sanctify anything? Nor can worship itself sanctify, but the Lord alone, who is worshiped, and from whom is the good and truth of worship; for this reason it is said that the gift does not sanctify, but the altar, “the gift” meaning the sacrifices that constituted the worship; and because the Jews did not understand this, but taught otherwise, they were called by the Lord “fools and blind.” [6] Because this was signified by the altar, all who touched it were sanctified as is evident in Moses: Seven days thou shalt sanctify (the altar), that the altar may be the holy of holies; whosoever shall touch the altar shall be sanctified (Exod. 29:37). “To touch” signifies to communicate, to transfer, and to receive (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 10130), here the Divine that proceeds from the Lord; and as this was signified by “touching,” and those who touched were sanctified, it follows that in the highest sense the Lord Himself is signified by the “altar,” for there is nothing holy from any other source. Moreover, all worship is worship of the Lord and from the Lord; and as worship in that church consisted chiefly of burnt-offerings and sacrifices, so the “altar” signified the Divine Itself from which (a quo) and this Divine is the Lord’s Divine Human."

[8] Because “the fire of the altar” signifies the Divine love, the prophet Isaiah was sanctified by it: Then flew one of the serap him unto me, in whose hand was a burning coal, which he had taken from off the altar, and he touched my mouth, and said, This hath touched thy lips; therefore thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin is expiated (Isa. 6:6, 7). What these words signify in their series can be seen when it is known that “the altar” signifies the Lord in respect to the Divine Human, and “the fire” on it the Divine good of His Divine love; that the prophet’s “mouth and lips” signify the doctrine of good and truth; and that “to touch” signifies to communicate; “iniquity which was taken away,” signifies falsity, and “sin” evil; for “iniquity” is predicated of the life of falsity, that is, of a life contrary to truths, and “sin” of the life of evil, that is, of a life contrary to good. [9] In Isaiah: All the flocks of Arabia shall be brought together unto Thee, the rams of Nebaioth shall minister unto Thee; they shall come up to Mine altar with acceptance; thus will I adorn the house of Mine adornment (60:7).

That the Lord in respect to the Divine Human is here meant is evident from the preceding part of that chapter, where it is said that “Jehovah shall arise upon thee, and His glory shall be seen upon thee,” with what follows, which describes the Divine wisdom with which the Lord will be filled in respect to His Human. [10] As “the altar” signifies in the highest sense the Lord’s Divine Human, “altar” therefore signifies also heaven and the church; for the angelic heaven, viewed in itself, is from the Divine that proceeds from the Lord’s Divine Human; from this it is that the angelic heaven in the whole complex is as one man; wherefore that heaven is called the Greatest Man (see what is said about this in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 59–86; and about the church, n. 57). And as all worship is from the Lord, for it is the Divine communicated to man from the Lord, in which is the Lord Himself, thence “altar” signifies also in general, everything of worship that proceeds from the good of love; and “temple” the worship that proceeds from truths from that good; for all worship is either from love or from faith, either from good or from truth; worship from the good of love is such as exists in the Lord’s celestial kingdom, and worship from truths from that good, which truths are called the truths of faith, is such as exists in the Lord’s spiritual kingdom (about which see also in the same work, n. 20–28). 391d.

It is also said, “yea, the bird hath found a house, and the swallow her nest,” because “bird” signifies spiritual truth and “swallow” natural truth, by which there is worship; and as all truth by which there is worship is from the good of love, it is first said, “my heart and my flesh sing for joy unto the living God,” “heart and flesh” signifying the good of love, and “sing for joy” worship from the delight of good. [12] Heaven and the church are also meant by “altar” in these passages in Revelation: There was given me a reed like unto a rod; and the angel stood and said to me, Rise and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that worship therein (11:1). I heard another angel out of the altar saying, Yea, O Lord God Almighty, true and righteous are Thy judgments (16:7).

[13] In Isaiah: In that day there shall be five cities in the land of Egypt that speak with the lips of Canaan, and that swear to Jehovah of Hosts; everyone of them shall be called Ir Cheres [the city of Cheres]. In that day there shall be an altar to Jehovah in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar to Jehovah besides the border thereof (19:18, 19). “Egypt” signifies the natural man, and its knowing faculty (scientificum); “in that day” signifies the Lord’s coming and the state of those who will then be in true knowledges (scientifica) from the Lord; “five cities in the land of Egypt that speak with the lips of Canaan” signify many truths of doctrine which are genuine truths of the church, “five” meaning many, “cities” the truths of doctrine, and “the lips of Canaan” genuine doctrinals of the church; “to swear to Jehovah of Hosts” signifies those that confess the Lord; “Jehovah of Hosts,” mentioned here and in many other passages in the Word, means the Lord in respect to all good and truth; for “hosts” (zebaoth) in the original signifies armies, and “armies” signify in the spiritual sense all the goods and truths of heaven and the church (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 3448, 7236, 7988, 8019). This, therefore, is the meaning of “Jehovah Zebaoth” or “Jehovah of Hosts;” “everyone of them shall be called Ir Cheres” signifies the doctrine glittering from spiritual truths in the natural, for “Ir” means city, and “city” signifies doctrine, “Cheres” means a glittering like that of the sun; “in that day there shall be an altar to Jehovah in the midst of the land of Egypt” signifies that there shall then be worship of the Lord from the good of love by means of true knowledges that are in the natural man; “an altar to Jehovah” signifying the worship of the Lord from the good of love, “in the midst of the land of Egypt” signifying by means of knowledges that are in the natural man, true knowledges meaning also cognitions from the sense of the letter of the Word; “and a pillar to Jehovah besides the border thereof” signifies the worship of the Lord from the truths of faith, “a pillar"

This is said of Jacob and Israel, by whom the church is signified, here the church that is to he destroyed; its destruction in respect to the truths of worship is described by “laying the stones of the altar as chalk-stones scattered,” “the stones of the altar” meaning the truths of worship, “as chalk-stones scattered” mean as falsities that do not cohere; “the groves and sun-statues shall rise no more” signifies that there shall no longer be any worship from spiritual and natural truths, “groves” signifying worship from spiritual truths, and “sun-statues” worship from natural truths. [15] In Lamentations: The Lord hath cast off His altar; He hath abhorred His sanctuary; He hath shut up in the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces (2:7). This is a lamentation over the vastation of all things of the church; that the church has ban vastated in respect to all goods is signified by “the Lord hath cast off His altar;” that it has been vastated in respect to all truths is signified by “He hath abhorred His sanctuary.” (That “sanctuary” is predicated of the church in respect to truths, see above, n. 204a.) That falsities and evils have entered into all things of the church is signified by “He hath shut up in the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces;” “enemy” signifies evil and falsity, “to shut up in his hands” signifies that these have seized and entered, “the walls of palaces” signifies all protecting truths, “palaces” mean the things of doctrine. 391e.

[17] In David: Do good in Thy good pleasure unto Zion; build Thou the walls of Jerusalem. Then shalt Thou be delighted with the sacrifices of righteousness, and with whole burnt-offering; then shall they offer up bullocks upon Thine altar (Ps. 51:18, 19). “Zion” means the church that is in the good of love, and “Jerusalem” the church that is in the truths of doctrine; therefore, “to do good in good pleasure unto Zion, and to build the walls of Jerusalem,” signifies to restore the church by leading it into the good of love and by instructing it in the truths of doctrine."

[18] In the same God is Jehovah who enlighteneth us; bind the festal-offering with ropes even to the horns of the altar. Thou art my God (Ps. 118:27, 28). “To enlighten” signifies to illustrate in truths; “to bind the festal- offering with ropes even to the horns of the altar” signifies to conjoin all things of worship, “to bind with ropes” meaning to conjoin, “the festal-offering to the horns of the altar” meaning all things of worship, “horns” mean all things because they are the ultimates, and “the festal-offering” and “altar” mean worship. All things of worship are conjoined when externals are conjoined with internals, and goods with truths.

The altar was outside the tent of meeting, and outside the temple; therefore what was done between the two signified communication and conjunction (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 10001, 10025; and that “Abel” signifies the good of charity, n. 342,374, 1179, 3325). It is evident that neither Abel nor Zachariah is meant here in the spiritual sense, since in the Word names signify things. [20] In Matthew: Jesus said, if thou shalt offer thy gift upon the altar, and shalt there remember that thy brother hath aught against thee, leave the gift before the altar, and go; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then coming offer thy gift (5:23, 24). “To offer a gift upon the altar” means in the spiritual sense to worship God, and to worship God means worship both internal and external, namely, from love and from faith, and thus from the life; this is meant because in the Jewish church worship consisted chiefly in offering sacrifices or gifts upon the altar, and the chief thing is taken for the whole. From this the meaning of these words of the Lord in the spiritual sense can be seen, namely, that Divine worship consists primarily in charity towards the neighbor, and not in piety without that; “to offer a gift upon the altar” means worship from piety, and “to be reconciled to a brother” means worship from charity, and this is truly worship, and such as this is such is the worship from piety.

[21] That “If thou shalt offer thy gift upon the altar” signifies in all worship, is evident from the Lord’s words in Luke 17:4; [Matt. 18:22], where it is said that the brother or neighbor must be forgiven all the time, “seventy times seven” there signifying always. 391f. Because such things are signified by “altar,” the altar was made either of wood or of ground, or of whole stones, upon which iron had not been moved, also it was overlaid with brass. The altar was made of wood, because “wood” signifies good; it was also made of ground because “ground” has a like signification; it was made of whole stones, because such “stones” signified truths formed out of good, or good in form, and it was forbidden to fit these stones by any hammer, axe, or instrument of iron, to signify that nothing of self-intelligence must come near to the formation of it; that it was overlaid with brass signified that it represented good in every part, for “brass” signifies good in externals. [22] That the altar was made of wood is evident in Moses: Thou shalt make the altar of shittim wood, five cubits long and broad; it shall be foursquare. And thou shalt make horns for it. And thou shalt make for it a grating of network of brass; the board-work shall be hollow (Exod. 27:1–8). And in Ezekiel: The altar was of wood, three cubits high, and the length of it two cubits; its corners, the length of it, and the walls of it, were of wood. Then he said unto me, This is the table that is before Jehovah (41:22). Moreover, the altar was made of wood, and overlaid with brass, for the sake of use, that it might be carried about, and removed from place to place in the wilderness, where the sons of Israel then were; also because “wood” signifies good, and “shittim-wood” good of righteousness, or the good of the Lord’s merit.

But that the altar was built also of ground, and if of stones, then of whole stones, and not hewn by any iron instrument, is further evident in Moses: An altar [of ground] thou shalt make unto Me, that thou mayest sacrifice thereon thy burnt-offerings and thy peace-offering. If thou makest to Me an altar of stones thou shalt not build it of hewn stones, for if thou move a tool upon it thou wilt profane it (Exod. 20:24, 25). If an altar of stones be built, no iron shall be struck upon the stones (Deut. 27:5, 6). 391g. [23] Thus far it has been shown what “altar” signifies in the genuine sense; from this it is clear what “altar” signifies in the contrary sense, namely, idolatrous worship, or infernal worship, which has place only with those who profess religion, but yet love and thus worship self and the world above all things; and when they do this they love evil and falsity; therefore “the altar,” in reference to such, signifies worship from evil, and “the statues” which they also had, worship from falsity, and therefore also hell. That this is the signification of “altar,” in the contrary sense, is evident from the following passages. In Isaiah: In that day shall a man have respect to his Maker, and his eyes shall look to the Holy One of Israel. And he shall not have respect to altar, the work of his hands, and he shall not look to that which his fingers have made, or to the groves or the sun statues (17:7, 8). This treats of the establishment of a new church by the Lord; that men shall then be led into the goods of life, and be instructed in the truths of doctrine, is meant by “In that day shall a man have respect to his Maker, and his eyes shall look to the Holy One of Israel.” The Lord is called “Maker” because He leads into the goods of life, for these make man; and He is called “the Holy One of Israel” because He teaches the truths of doctrine; therefore it is added, “a man shall have respect,” and “his eyes shall look;” man is"

This declares that the idolatrous worship of the Jewish nation was so deeply rooted that it could not be removed. That it was too deeply rooted to be removed is signified by “the sin of Judah is written with a pen of iron, with a point of a diamond, it is graven upon the table of their heart, and upon the horns of their altars;” deeply-rooted falsity is meant by “it is written with a pan of iron, and with the point of a diamond,” and deeply-rooted evil is meant by “it is graven upon the table of the heart, and upon the horns of their altars;” it is said “upon the horns of the altars,” because idolatrous worship is meant. The “sons whom He remembers,” signify the falsities of evil; “the altars” idolatrous worship from evil; “the groves by the green tree” such worship from falsities; “upon the high hills” signifies the adulteration of good and the falsification of truths; for at that time, when all things of worship were representative of celestial and spiritual things, they had worship in groves and upon hills, for the reason that “trees,” of which groves consist, signify the knowledges and perceptions of truth and good, and this according to the kind of trees; and because"

Such persons therefore, think of religion in the natural-sensual; consequently they neither understand nor desire to understand any of the things they say they believe, saying that the understanding must be under obedience to faith. Such as these were represented by the Israelites separated from the Jews, or by Samaria separated from Jerusalem, and the worship of such was represented by the altars in Bethel and Dan; such worship, in so far as it is separated from charity, is no worship, for in it the mouth speaks apart from the understanding and the will, that is, apart from the mind; apart from the understanding, because they say that men ought to believe even though they do not understand; and apart from the will because they put aside deeds or goods of charity. [30] That such worship is no worship is signified by what is said in the first book of Kings: When Jeroboam stood by the altar in Bethel, the man of God cried out to him that the altar should be rent, and the ashes poured out; and so it came to pass (12:26 at the end; 13:1–6). “The altar should be rent and the ashes poured out” signifies that there was no worship whatever. Faith separated from charity was then signified by “Samaria,” because the Jewish kingdom signified the celestial church, that is, the church that is in the good of love, and the Israelitish kingdom signified the spiritual church which is in the truths from that good. This was signified by the Jewish and Israelitish kingdom while they were under one king, or while they were united; but when they were separated, the Israelitish kingdom signified truth separated from good, or what is the same, faith separated from charity. Moreover, worship is signified by “the altar,” because it is signified by the burnt-offerings and sacrifices that were offered upon it, in many other passages too numerous to be cited.

The reason of this was that to the ancient church, which was a representative church and extended through a great part of the Asiatic world, sacrifices were unknown, and when they were instituted by Eber it looked upon them as abominable, that is, that they should wish to appease God by the slaughter of different animals, thus by blood. Among those who were of the ancient church were also the Egyptians; but as they applied representatives to magic that church became extinct among them They were unwilling to eat bread with the Hebrews, because at that time “dinners” and “suppers” represented and thus signified spiritual consociation, which is consociation and con junction through those things that pertain to the church; and “bread” signified in general all spiritual food and thus “dining” and “supping” all conjunction.

The souls of those slain because of the Word of God, and because of the testimony that they held, signifies those who were rejected and concealed because of Divine truth and because of their confession of the Lord. This is evident from the signification of “those slain,” as being those who were rejected by the evil and concealed by the Lord (of whom presently) also from the signification of “the Word of God,” as being Divine truth. What the Lord speaks is called the Word of God, and that is Divine truth. The Word or the Sacred Scripture is nothing else; for in it all Divine truth is contained, but it is only before the angels that the truth itself in its glory is manifest in it, because to them the interior things of the Word, which are spiritual and celestial, become manifest and also constitute their wisdom. “The Word of God,” therefore, signifies in the genuine sense Divine truth, and in the highest sense the Lord Himself who spoke it, for He spoke from Himself, or from His Divine, and what proceeds from Him that also is Himself. [2] That the Divine proceeding is the Lord may be illustrated by this: About every angel there is a sphere that is called the sphere of his life; this spreads abroad to a great distance from him. This sphere flows out or proceeds from the life of his affection or love; it is therefore an extension outside of him of such life as is in him. This extension is effected by means of the spiritual atmosphere or aura, which is the aura of heaven. By means of that sphere the quality of angel in respect to affection is perceived at a distance by others; this has been granted me sometimes to perceive. But about the Lord there is a Divine sphere, which near Him appears as a sun, which is His Divine love, and from this that sphere proceeds into"

This comparison with angels is made as an illustration, to show that the Divine proceeding from the Lord is the Lord Himself, because it is a proceeding of His love, and the proceeding is Himself outside of Himself. The above is further evident from the signification of “testimony,” as being the confession of the Lord, and the Lord Himself (of which presently). [3] That “those slain” here mean those who were rejected by evil spirits and concealed by the Lord, or removed from the eyes of others and preserved to the day of the last judgment, can be seen from what was said in the article above, also from what follows in the two verses in which they alone are described in the article above it was said that “the former heaven” that passed away consisted of those who in externals lived a moral life, and yet were merely natural and not spiritual, or who lived a sort of spiritual life merely from the affection or love of fame, honor, glory, and gain, thus for the sake of appearance. Although these were inwardly evil, they, nevertheless, were tolerated, and constituted societies in the higher places in the spiritual world. These societies, taken together, were called a heaven, but “the former heaven” that afterwards passed away. From this it came to pass that all those who were spiritual, that is, who were inwardly as well as outwardly good, not being able to be with these, withdrew from them, either voluntarily or being driven away, and wherever found they were persecuted; on this account they were concealed by the Lord and preserved in their places until the day of judgment, that they might constitute “the new heaven.” These therefore are those that are meant by “the souls of those slain seen under the altar.” This makes clear that “those slain” signify those who were rejected and concealed, for they were hated by the others, because of Divine truth and because of their confession of the Lord; and those who are hated are called “those slain,” because to hate is spiritually to slay. That such are meant by “the souls of those slain,” can he seen further from what follows in the two verses where it is said of them, “And they cried out with a great voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost Thou not judge and avenge our blood on those that dwell on the earth?"

And unless these things had been revealed to some one, all things contained in Revelation in its internal sense must have remained hidden; for in it such things as were to take place in the spiritual world before the last judgment, and while it was going on, and after it are chiefly treated of. 392b. [4] That “testimony” signifies the confession of the Lord, and the Lord Himself, can be seen from the passages in the Word that follow. This signification has its origin from this, that the Word in each and every particular testifies respecting the Lord; for in its inmost sense it treats of the Lord alone, and in its internal sense of the celestial and spiritual things that proceed from the Lord, and in particular the Lord testifies respecting Himself in everyone who is in the life of love and charity; for the Lord flows into their heart and life and teaches them, especially respecting His Divine Human; for He grants to those who are in a life of love to think of God under the human form, and God under the human form is the Lord. The simple in the Christian world so think, as also the heathen who live in charity according to then religious principle. Both these are astonished when they here the learned speak of God as not to be perceived in any human form, for they know that thinking thus they could not see any God in thought, and therefore could have little belief in the existence of a God, since the faith which is the faith of charity wishes to comprehend in some way what is believed; for faith is of thought, and to think what is incomprehensible is not to think, but only to have knowledge and to speak from that without any idea.

This has been said that it may be known why “testimony” signifies the Lord, namely, because the Lord testifies respecting Himself with all who accept His testimony, and these are such as live a life of love to the Lord, and a life of charity towards the neighbor. These receive His testimony and confess Him, because a life of love and charity opens the interior mind by the influx of light from heaven, for a life of love and charity is the Divine life itself; for the Lord loves everyone, and does good to everyone from love; consequently where that life is received the Lord is present and is conjoined to the man, and thus flows into his higher mind which is called the spiritual mind, and by light from Himself opens it. 392c. [5] That “testimony” signifies the Lord, and with man the confession of the Lord from the heart, and in particular, the acknowledgment of the Lord’s Divine in His Human, can be seen from this, that the law which was given on Mount Sinai and written upon two tables, and afterwards placed in the ark, is called the “testimony;” whence also the ark was called “the ark of the testimony,” and the tables also were called “the tables of testimony;” and because this was most holy, the mercy seat was placed upon the ark, and over the mercy seat were sculptured two cherubim, between which Jehovah, that is, the Lord, spoke with Moses and Aaron. This makes clear that “the testimony” signifies the Lord Himself; otherwise the mercy seat would not have been placed upon the ark, nor would the Lord have spoken with Moses and Aaron between the cherubim which were upon the mercy seat. Moreover, when Aaron entered within the veil, which he did once every year, he was first sanctified, and afterwards he burnt incense till the smoke of the incense covered the mercy seat; it is said that unless he did this he would have died. From this it is clearly evident that the testimony that was in the ark, and that was the law given on Mount Sinai and inscribed on two tables of stone, signified the Lord Himself."

The Word is the Lord because the Word signifies Divine truth, and all Divine truth proceeds from the Lord, for it is the light in heaven, that enlightens the minds of the angels and also the minds of men, and gives them wisdom; this light in its essence is Divine truth proceeding from the Lord as a Sun (of which light, see in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 126–140); therefore it is afterwards said, “the Word was with God, and God was the Word.” It is also said in John: In Him was life; and the life was the light of men. That was the true Light, which lighteth every man coming into the world (verses 4, 9, in that chapter). [8] This makes clear that the Lord is meant by “the testimony;” for the law written on the two tables, which was called the “testimony,” signifies the Word in the whole complex, and the Lord is the Word. (That “the law” in a broad sense, signifies the Word in the whole complex, in a sense less broad the historical Word, and in a strict sense the ten commandments of the Decalogue, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 6752.) This law was also called “a Covenant,” and so the tables on which it was inscribed were called “the tables of the Covenant,” and the ark was called “the ark of the Covenant” (see Exod. 34:28; Num. 14:44; Deut. 9:9, 15; Rev. 11:19; and elsewhere); and this because “covenant” signifies conjunction, and the Word or Divine truth is what conjoins man with the Lord; from no other source is there any conjunction. (That “covenant” signifies conjunction, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 665,666, 1023,1038, 1864, 1996, 2003, 2021, 6804,8767, 8778, 9396, 10632.) This law is called both “a Covenant” and “a testimony,” because when called “a Covenant” it means the Word by which there is conjunction; and when called “a testimony” it means the Lord Himself who conjoins; and on man’s part, the confession of the Lord and the acknowledgment of His Divine in His Human, which conjoin.

[9] That “testimony” signifies the Lord, and on man’s part the confession of the Lord and the acknowledgment of His Divine in His Human, is evident also from these passages in the Word. In Revelation: They overcame the dragon by the blood of the Lamb, and by the Word of the testimony. And the dragon was angry, and went away to make war with the remnant of her seed, that keep the commandment of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ (12:11, 17). I am thy fellow-servant, and of thy brethren that hold the testimony of Jesus. The testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy (19:10). “The testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy” signifies that the confession of the Lord and the acknowledgment of His Divine in His Human is the life of all truth, both in the Word and in doctrine from the Word. [10] And elsewhere: The souls of those slain with the axe for the testimony of Jesus, and for the Word of God, received not the mark upon their forehead and upon their hand (20:4). These passages will be explained in what follows. In David: Jerusalem is builded as a city that is conjoined together; and thither the tribes go up, the tribes of Jah a testimony to Israel, to confess to the name of Jehovah. For there are set thrones for judgment (Ps. 122:3–5). “Jerusalem” signifies the church in relation to doctrine, which is said to be “builded” when it is established by the Lord; “as a city that is conjoined together” signifies doctrine in which all things are in order, “city” meaning doctrine “thither the tribes go up, the tribes of Jah,” signifies that in it are all truths and goods in the"

That this is what “thrones” signify, see above (n. 253a). [11] In the same: Jehovah hath set up a testimony in Jacob, and a law In Israel (Ps. 78:5). “Jacob” and “Israel” signify the church, “Jacob” the external church, and “Israel” the internal church; and “testimony” and “law” signify the Word, “testimony” that in the Word which teaches the goods of life, and “the law” that in it which teaches the truths of doctrine. Because those who are in the external church are in the good of life according to the truths of doctrine, and those who are in the internal church are in the truths of doctrine according to which is the life, so “testimony” is predicated of Jacob, and “the law” of Israel. [12] In the same: If thy sons shall keep My covenant, and the testimony that I shall tech them, their sons shall sit upon the throne for thee for evermore (Ps. 132:12). This is said of David, but David here means the Lord; “his sons” mean those who do the Lord’s commandments; of these it is said, “if thy sons shall have kept My covenant and My testimony,” “covenant” meaning the like as “law” above, namely, the truth of doctrine, and testimony” the like as testimony” above, namely, the good of life according to the truths of doctrine. Like things are signified by “covenant” and “testimonies” in David (Ps. 25:10).

The commandments of Jehovah are right, making glad the heart; the precept of Jehovah is pure, enlightening the eyes; the judgments of Jehovah are truth, they are righteous altogether (Ps. 14:7–9). Blessed are the perfect in the way, who walk in the law of Jehovah. Blessed are they that observe His testimonies, that seek after Him with the whole heart. Thou hast enjoined Thy commandments to be strictly kept. O that my ways may be directed to keep Thy statutes! Then shall I not be ashamed, when I have respect unto all Thy precepts. I will confess to thee in uprightness of heart, when I shall have learned the judgments of Thy righteousness (Ps. 119:1–7; in like manner in verses 12–16, 88, 89, 151–166, etc.). 393. Verse 10. And they cried out with a great voice, signifies their grief of mind. This is evident from the signification of “to cry out,” as being vehement grief of mind, for this manifests itself by the sound of crying out in speech; consequently “crying out” in the Word signifies grief. Moreover, every affection, whether of grief or joy, expresses itself by sounds, and ideas of thought by the expressions in the sound. This is why sound in speech manifests both the quality and measure of the affection, and this more clearly in the spiritual world than in the natural world, for the reason that it is not permitted there to show forth any affections other than those that are the mind’s own. In the spiritual world, therefore, anyone who is wise can hear and perceive the affection of another, solely from his speech. (That with spirits and angels sounds belong to affection, and words to the ideas of the thought, see in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 241, and above, n. 323a.) That “to cry out,” and “a crying out,” in the Word, signify grief, is evident from many passages there, of which I will cite this only from Isaiah: Heshbon cried out, and Elealeh; their voice was heard even to Jahaz; therefore the armed men of Moab shall shout; his soul shall be ill within him.

That “crying out” in the Word is predicated of various affections, such as interior lamentation, beseeching and supplication from anguish, attestation and indignation, confession, supplication, and also exultation and other states (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 2240, 2821, 2841, 4779, 5016, 5018,5027, 5323, 5365, 5870, 6801, 6802, 6862, 7119, 7142, 7782, 8179, 8353, 9202). 394. Saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost Thou not judge and avenge our blood upon them that dwell on the earth? signifies sighings to the Lord, who is justice, respecting the judgment and removal of those who persecute and infest those who openly acknowledge the Lord and are in the life of charity. This is evident from the signification of “crying out and saying, How long, O Lord,” as being to pour out to the Lord sighs from grief, for these are the words of those that groan and sigh and supplicate for justice. Also from the signification of “holy and true,” as being the One who is Justice; for justice when predicated of the Lord, signifies that He does not tolerate such things, and this because He is holy and true. Also from the signification of “to judge and avenge our blood,” as being the judgment and removal of those who persecute and infest those who openly acknowledge the Lord and are in the life of charity. This is the signification of these words because “blood” signifies all violence offered to Divine good and Divine truth, thus to the Lord; consequently violence offered to those who are in the life of charity and faith. To offer violence to these is to offer violence to the Lord Himself, according to the words of the Lord Himself in Matthew: Inasmuch as ye did it unto one of My least brethren, ye did it unto Me (25:40, 45).

[2] From this the meaning of these words in their genuine sense can be seen; but no one can know that such things are meant unless it has been revealed to him. For otherwise who could know who are meant by “the souls of those slain,” and what is meant by “to avenge their blood upon those that dwell on the earth?” One who does not know from revelation who these are must conclude that the martyrs only are meant; when yet these were not the martyrs, but all such as were persecuted and infested by those who were in the former heaven that passed away; for these were such that they thrust out from themselves all who openly acknowledged the Lord and were in the life of charity, because they were interiorly evil (as has been said above, n. 391a, 392a). To this I will add the following: all in the spiritual world who are interiorly evil, however moral a life in externals they may have lived in the world, are utterly unable to tolerate anyone who worships the Lord and lives the life of charity; as soon as they see such, they infest and either do them injury or treat them shamefully. I have often wondered at this, and all who do not know about it must wonder, since these same persons, when in the world, tolerated preachings respecting the Lord and also respecting charity, and themselves talked about these things doctrinally, yet when they become spirits they cannot tolerate them. The reason is that this aversion is inherent in their evil in which they are; for in their evil there is hostility, yea, hatred against the Lord, and also against those who are led by the Lord, who are those who are in the life of charity; but this hostility and this hatred lie concealed in their spirit; consequently when they become spirits they are in them; then that antipathy or antagonism inherent in evil comes forth.

From this it can be seen why those who openly acknowledged the Lord and lived the life of charity were delivered by the Lord from the violence of such spirits, and were concealed in the lower earth, and there preserved until the judgment. But after the judgment those who had dwelt above the earth, upon the mountains, hills, and rocks there, who were, as said above, interiorly evil, were cast out; and those who had been hidden under the earth, or under heaven, were elevated and allotted an inheritance in the places from which the former were cast out.

This is evident from the signification of “a white robe” as being Divine truth from the Lord, for “robe” signifies truth in general, because it is a general covering; and “white” is predicated of truths which are from the Lord; for whiteness pertains to light, and the light proceeding from the Lord as a sun is in its essence Divine truth. That “white robes were given to everyone of them” signifies also protection, will be told further on; but let it first be told why “a white robe” signifies Divine truth from the Lord.

From this it can be seen that the appearances that exist in heaven before the angels are altogether real; in like manner also the garments. As spirits and angels are clothed according to intelligence, and all intelligence is of truth, and angelic intelligence is of Divine truth, so they are clothed according to truths this is why “garments” signify truths; “the garments” that are next to the body, that is, the inner garments, signify interior truths; but the garments that are outside of these and encompass them, signify exterior truths; therefore “a robe,” “a mantle,” and “a cloak,” which are general coverings, signify truths in general, and “a white robe” Divine truth in general which they have from the Lord. (But see what has been shown respecting The Garments with which Angels are Clothed, in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 177–182; and what has been said above about the signification of garments, n. 64, 65, 195, 271.)

This also takes place with those who are elevated by the Lord into heaven. They are then clothed with white garments, which is an indication that they are in Divine truth, and thus in safety. But respecting those who were clothed in white robes more will be shown in the explanation of the following chapter (at verses 9, 13–17)."

In Zechariah: The prophets shall be ashamed every man of his vision which he hath prophesied; neither shall they wear a mantle of hair to dissemble (13:4). “Prophets” signify those who teach truths from the Word, and in an abstract sense, the truths of doctrine from the Word; and because of this signification of “prophets” they were clothed with a mantle of hair, “the mantle of hair” signifying Divine truth in ultimates, which is Divine truth in general, for the ultimate contains all things interior; “hair,” too, signifies the ultimate. This is why: Elijah, from his mantle, was called a hairy man (2 Kings 1:7, 8); And John the Baptist, who was as Elijah by reason of a like representation, had a garment of camel’s hair (Matt. 3:4). This makes clear the signification of “the prophets shall not wear a mantle of hair to dissemble,” namely, that they shall not declare truths to be falsities, and falsities to be truths; this is what is signified by “dissembling.” [4] Because Elijah represented the Lord in relation to the Word, which is the doctrine of truth itself, and Elisha continued the representation, and because “mantle” signified Divine truth in general, which is the Word in ultimates, so the mantle divided the waters of Jordan, according to the following in the books of the Kings: When Elijah found Elisha he cast his mantle upon him (1 Kings 19:19). Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and smote the waters of Jordan, and they were divided hither and thither, and they two passed over on the dry ground (2 Kings 2:8)."

From this, too, it can be seen that “a mantle” and “a robe” signify Divine truth in general. (That “Elijah” represented the Lord in relation to the Word, so, too, “Elisha,” see Arcana Coelestia, n. 2762, 5247. That the ultimate contains the interior things, and thus signifies all things in general, n. 634, 6239, 6465, 9215, 9216, 9828; that thus strength and power are in ultimates, n. 9836; that “Jordan” signifies the entrance into the church, and thus “the waters of Jordan” signify the first truths through which there is entrance, n. 1585, 4255; and that “waters” mean truths, see above, n. 71.) First truths are also ultimate truths, such as are in the sense of the letter of the Word, for through these entrance is effected, for these are first learned, and in them are all interior things which constitute the internal sense of the Word. 395c. [5] One who does not know what “robe” or “mantle” signifies, does not know what “cloak” signifies, for a cloak, as well as a mantle, was a general garment, encompassing the tunic or inner garment, therefore it has a like signification.

Of Saul’s rending the skirt of Samuel’s cloak, we read: Samuel turned to go away, but he laid hold upon the skirt of his cloak and it was rent. And Samuel said, Jehovah hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to thy companion, who is better than thou (1 Sam. 15:27, 28). The words of Samuel make clear that “the rending of the skirt of the cloak” signified the rending of the kingdom from Saul, for he said after it was done, “Jehovah hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day,” “a king” and “his kingdom” signifying the Divine truth of the church, and “the skirt of a cloak” signifying Divine truth in ultimates, that is, all Divine truth in general; for the kings that were over the sons of Israel represented the Lord in relation to Divine truth, and their kingdom signified the church in relation to Divine truth; therefore this historical fact signifies that king Saul was such that he could no longer represent the Lord, and that the representation of the church would perish if the kingdom were not rent from him. (That “kings” represented the Lord in relation to Divine truth, and thus “a kingdom,” signified the church in relation to Divine truth, see above, n. 29, 31.) [6] The same is signified by David’s cutting off the skirt of Saul’s cloak, of which we read: David entered into the cave where Saul was, and cut off the skirt of his cloak, and when he afterwards showed it to Saul, Saul said, Now I know that thou shalt reign, and the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thy hand (1 Sam. 24:3–5, 11, 20). This was done by David of divine providence, that the like might be represented as above, “the skirt of the cloak,” and “king Saul and his kingdom,” having the like meaning as above."

This signified that Jonathan, the heir of the kingdom, transferred all his right to David; for all the things that Jonathan gave to David were representative of the kingdom, that is, of the Divine truth of the church, which Saul represented; for as was said above, all the kings who were over the sons of Israel represented the Lord in relation to Divine truth, and their kingdom represented the church in relation to Divine truth. [8] Because “cloaks” and “robes” signify Divine truth in general: The king’s daughters that were virgins were clad in robes of divers colors (2 Sam. 13:18). “King’s daughters that were virgins” signified the affections of truth, and thus the church, as can be seen from a thousand passages in the Word in which “the king’s daughter,” “the daughter of Zion,” “the daughter of Jerusalem,” also “the virgin of Zion,” and “the virgin of Jerusalem” are mentioned; therefore “the king’s daughters” represented also the truths of that affection by their garments, and in general by their robes, which, were therefore, variegated with divers colors. So also truths from good, or truths from affection, are represented by the garments of the virgins in heaven; which truths are more fully described by: The garments of the king’s daughter (Ps. 45:9, 10, 13, 14). 395d.

(That “rending the garments” was a representative of mourning because of truth injured or destroyed, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 4763.) And again in Ezekiel: All the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones, and shall put away their cloaks and strip off their broidered garments; they shall be clothed with terrors; they shall sit upon the earth (26:16). This is said of Tyre, which signifies the church in respect to the knowledges of truth and good, here the church where these are destroyed. That there are no longer any truths through which there can be a church, is signified by “all the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones;” “the princes of the sea” meaning true primary knowledges; “to come down from thrones” signifying that these have been destroyed, and consequently that there is no intelligence. The like is signified by “they shall east away their cloaks and strip off their broidered garments,” “cloaks” meaning truths in general, and “broidered garments” the knowledges of truth; the consequent damnation is signified by “they shall be clothed with terrors; they shall sit upon the earth.” [10] In Micah: My people have set up an enemy for themselves for the sake of a garment; ye strip off the mantle from them that pass by securely, returning from war (2:8). These words do not mean that “the sons of Israel have set up an enemy for the sake of a garment, and have stripped off the mantle from those that pass by securely;” but they mean that they held as enemies those who spoke truths, and deprived of all truth those who had lived well and had shaken off falsities, “garment” meaning"

Who cannot see that this is the spiritual meaning of the Word; and not that the people of Israel held some one as an enemy for the sake of a garment, or stripped off the mantle from those who passed by? [11] In Matthew: The scribes and Pharisees do all their works that they may be seen of men, and make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their robes (23:5). This the scribes and Pharisees did, but it also represented and signified that they talked about, and applied to life and to their traditions many things from the ultimates of the Word, in order that they might appear holy and learned. “Their phylacteries which they make broad,” signify goods in outward form, for “phylacteries” were worn upon the hands, and “hands” signify deeds, because these are done by the bands; “the borders of their robes which they enlarge,” signify external truths; external truths are those that are in the ultimate sense of the letter; “robes” mean truths in general, and “borders” their ultimates.

[13] In the same: He put on the garments of vengeance, and covered Himself with zeal as with a robe (59:17). This is said of the Lord and of His combat with the hells; for when He was in the world He reduced all things in the hells and in the heavens to order, and this by Divine truth from Divine love. “Garments of vengeance” signify the truths by which, and “zeal as a robe” the Divine love from which this was done; “robe” is mentioned to signify that it was done through Divine truths from Divine love. (But what “the robe of the ephod” signifies, in which Aaron was arrayed, and upon the borders of which were pomegranates and hells, of which in Exod. 28:31–35; Lev. 8:7, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 9910–9928). 396.

(That time signifies the state of life, see in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 162–169.) 397. Until their fellow-servants as well as their brethren, who were to be killed, as they also were, should be fulfilled, signifies until evils were consummated This is evident from the signification of “until they should be fulfilled,” as being until they were consummated; also from the signification of “their fellow-servants as well as their brethren, who were to be killed, as they also were,” as being evils, for to kill these denotes evil, “fellow-servants” meaning those who are in truths, and “brethren” those who are in goods, and “fellow- servants” and “brethren” together those who are in truths from good; for in the internal sense the two are conjoined into one. “Consummation” is mentioned in some passages in the Word, likewise “when evils are consummated,” but scarcely anyone at this day knows what this signifies.

These, because they were interiorly evil, would not tolerate among them those that were interiorly good, and this because their affections and thoughts were discordant, for all consociations in the spiritual world are effected according to agreement of affections and thence of thoughts; for angels and spirits are nothing but affections and thoughts therefrom in a human form; and as those who then were in the high places could not endure the presence of those who were interiorly good, they cast them out from among them, and wherever they saw them, treated them wrongfully and shamefully, consequently the good were delivered by the Lord from this violence and concealed under heaven and preserved; and this was taking place from the time when the Lord was in the world even until this time when the judgment was accomplished; then those who were on high places were cast down, and those who were under heaven were elevated. The evil were tolerated so long on the high places, and the good were detained so long under heaven, in order that both “might be fulfilled,” which means that there might be a sufficient number of the good to form a new heaven, and also that the evil might sink down of themselves into hell; for the Lord casts no one down into hell, but the evil itself which is with evil spirits casts them down (as may be seen in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 545–550). This takes place when evils are consummated, that is, fulfilled. [2] This also is what is meant by the Lord’s words in Matthew: The servants of the householder coming, said, Didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? whence then are the tares? And they said, Wilt thou therefore that we go and gather them up? But he said, Nay, lest in gathering the tares ye root up at the same time the wheat with them. Let both grow together until the harvest; and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them into bundles to burn them; but gather the wheat into the barn. So shall it be in the consummation of the age (13:27–30, 37–42)."

(But of these see further in the small work on the Last Judgment, n. 65–72.) From all this it can in some measure be known why it was said to them “that they should rest yet a little time, until their fellow-servants, as well as their brethren, who were to be killed, as they also were, should be fulfilled;” “to be killed” has here the like signification as “to be slain” above (n. 392a), namely, to be rejected by the evil because of Divine truth, and because of their confession of the Lord. [3] When this is known it can be known what is signified by “consummation” and by “iniquity consummated” in the following passages. In Moses: Jehovah said, I will go down and see whether they have made a consummation, according to the cry that is come unto Me (Gen. 18:20, 21). This is said of Sodom.

In Daniel: At last upon the bird of abominations shall be desolation, and even to the consummation and decision it shall drop upon the devastation (9:27); and elsewhere. “Consummation” and “decision” in these passages signify the last state of the church, a state in which there is no longer any truth because there is no good, or in which there is no longer any faith because there is no charity; and when this is the state of the church, then comes the last judgment. the Last Judgment then comes, for the further reason that the human race is the basis or foundation of the angelic heaven, for the conjunction of the angelic heaven with the human race is perpetual, the one subsisting by means of the other; when therefore the basis does not correspond the angelic heaven totters; consequently there must then be a judgment upon those who are in the spiritual world, that all things in the heavens as well as in the hells, may be reduced to order. (That the human race is the basis and foundation of the angelic heaven, and that the conjunction is perpetual, see in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 291–310.) From this it can be known that “consummation” means the last state of the church, when there is no longer any faith because there is no charity.

Verse 12.

That this prediction, which is signified by “the sixth seal was opened,” involves a total change in the state of the church, is evident from what has been said before, and from what follows in this chapter. In what precedes it was predicted that the understanding of the Word in relation to good, and afterwards in relation to truth, would perish, and that at length there would be no understanding of the Word in consequence of the evils of life and the falsities of doctrine from them.

This is evident from what precedes; also from what follows, since it is said that “the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood, and the stars of heaven fell unto the earth,” with many other things, which signify that there was no longer any good of love nor any truth of faith, nor any knowledges of good and truth; which makes clear that “a great earthquake” here signifies a total change in the state of the church. [2] It is evident, moreover, from many passages in the Word, that “an earthquake” signifies a change in the state of the church; and some of these shall be cited in what follows. This signification of “earthquake” is from appearances in the spiritual world. In that world, as well as in the natural world, there are lands, valleys, hills, mountains, and on them societies of spirits and angels dwell. Before the new heaven was formed upon these places, they were seen to undergo remarkable changes; some appeared to sink down, some to be agitated and shaken, and some appeared to be rolled up, as the scroll of a book is rolled up, and to be borne away, and some appeared to shake and tremble as by a great earthquake. Such things were often seen by me before the new heaven was formed, and were always signs of a change there in the state of the church. When there was a quaking and trembling as from an earthquake it was a sign that the state of the church was changed in that place, and the amount of change was made evident from the extent and character of the earth’s motion; and when the state of the church with them was completely changed from good into evil and from truth into falsity, the earth there appeared to be rolled up like the scroll of a book and to be taken away; this is what is meant by the words in verse 14 of this chapter, namely, “and the heaven departed as a book rolled up.” Like things also appeared to John, for when he saw these things he was in the spirit, as he himself says (1:10; 4:2); and he who sees in the spirit sees the things that exist and appear in the spiritual world.

[3] That “earth quakes” and “tremblings of the earth” have no other meaning in the Word can be seen from the following passages. In Joel: The earth trembled before Him, the heavens quaked, the sun and the moon were blackened, and the stars withdrew their brightness (2:10). “Earth and heavens” here, as often elsewhere, signify the church; “earth” the external church, and “heavens” the internal church. The external church means the worship from good and truth in the natural man; and the internal church, the good of love and the faith, which is in the spiritual man, from which is worship; for as there is an internal and an external man, or a spiritual and a natural man, so is it with the church, since the church is in man, and is made up of men in whom the church is. A change and perversion of the church is signified by “the earth trembled, and the heavens quaked;” “the sun and the moon were blackened” signifies that there is no good of love or truth of faith, and “the stars withdrew their brightness” signifies that there were no longer any knowledges of truth and good. [4] In Isaiah: I will make a man more rare than fine gold; therefore I will make heaven to tremble, and the earth shall quake out of its place, in the fury of Jehovah of Hosts, and in the day of the fury of His anger (13:12, 13). “Man” (virum hominem) means intelligence, and “to make him more rare than fine gold” means that there is scarcely any intelligence left, intelligence meaning intelligence from truths, for all intelligence is from truths; “therefore I will make heaven to tremble, and the earth shall quake out of its place,” signifies that the good of love and the truth of faith and worship therefrom in externals are dispersed, “heaven and earth” signifying here, as above, the internal and the external of the church; the internal of"

What is signified by “the fury of Jehovah, and the glowing of His anger,” will be told in the explanation of verse 17, below. [5] In the same: The flood gates from on high were opened, and the foundations of the earth quaked, in breaking the earth was broken, in shaking the earth was shaken, in staggering the earth staggers as a drunkard, it sways like a hut; and its transgression is heavy upon it; and it shall fall and shall not rise again (24:18–20). This is most evidently said of the church, not of the earth; for who can think that the foundations of the earth have quaked, that the earth has been shaken, that it staggers like a drunkard, that it sways like a hut? But anyone can understand these words when, instead of the earth, the church is thought of. These words evidently signify a change and perversion of the church, for it is said “its transgression is heavy upon it, and it shall fall and shall not rise again;” “the flood gates that were opened from on high,” also mean an inundation of evil and of falsity. [6] In David: The earth tottered and quaked; the foundations of the mountains trembled, because He was wroth (Ps. 18:7). This does not mean that it was the earth and its foundations that tottered and quaked, but the church and the truths upon which it was founded; for “earth” signifies the church, and the “foundations of the mountains” signify the truths on which the church is founded, which are truths from good; “because He was wroth” has the like signification as “the wrath of Jehovah,” in the Word.

When the state of these in respect to truths is changed, their habitations, and thus the foundations of the mountains, tremble. That there are such things in the spiritual world, and that they exist from changes of the state of the church there, no one except he to whom it is revealed can know.

His wrath is poured out like fire, and the rocks are torn down before Him (1:5, 6). “Mountains” signify the church in which there is love to the Lord, and “hills” the church in which there is love towards the neighbor; so, too, “mountains” signify love to the Lord, and “hills” love towards the neighbor, for the reason that angels who are in love to the Lord dwell upon mountains, and those who are in love toward the neighbor dwell upon hills. When in place of love to the Lord love of self reigns, and in place of love towards the neighbor love of the world reigns, then the mountains are said “to quake,” and the hills “to dissolve;” for this occurs in the spiritual world, not with the angels, who are in heaven, but with those spirits that made for themselves a semblance of heaven upon the mountains and hills before the last judgment. Because the love of self and the world is meant, it is said that “they dissolve,” and that “the earth is burned up before Him, the world and all that dwell therein,” also that “His wrath is poured out like fire,” for “fire” signifies such loves, and “to dissolve” and “to be burned” signify to perish by them; “the rocks that are torn down,” signify the truths of faith, because those who"

Here, too, “the earth” signifies the church, but the church in which are falsities, which is said “to quake” when falsities are believed and are called truths. “Nations” signify the evils of falsity; the casting down into hell and destruction of these evils is signified by “the nations are not able to abide His indignation.” Because “the earth” here signifies the church in which are falsities, it is said “God in truth, He is the living God, and the King of an age;” for Jehovah is called “God” and “King” from Divine truth, “a living God” from Divine truth in the heavens, and “King of an age,” from Divine truth on the earth; and as good is also treated of in the Word wherever truth is treated of, because of the heavenly marriage in the particulars of the Word, and so on the other hand, where falsity is treated of, evil is also treated of, mention is made also of “the nations,” by which the evils of falsity are signified. What the evils of falsity that flow from the falsities of doctrine are, may be illustrated as follows: where the doctrine prevails that faith alone and not the good of life saves, also that to one who has faith nothing of evil is imputed, and that a man may be saved by faith alone, even at the end of his life, provided he then believes that the Lord has delivered all from the yoke of the law by His fulfillment of it, and has made atonement by His blood, in that case the evils that a man does in consequence of such a faith are the evils of falsity."

Who does not see that this does not mean that fishes of the sea, the fowl of the heavens, the wild beast of the field, and the creeping thing of the ground are to quake before Jehovah? [10] In Jeremiah: At the sound of the fall of Edom and of the inhabitants of Teman the earth quaked, there is a cry, and the sound of it was heard in the sea of Suph (49:21). Here “Edom and the inhabitants of Teman” are not meant, but the evils and falsities that are opposed to the goods and truths of the celestial kingdom; therefore “at the sound of the fall of Edom and of the inhabitants of Teman the earth quaked,” signifies that the church was changed and perished by those evils and falsities; “a cry, and the sound of it was heard in the sea of Suph,” signifies their damnation; “the sea of Suph” meaning damnation; “cry” is predicated of the damnation of evil, and “sound” of the damnation of falsity. (That “the sea of Suph” signifies damnation and hell, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 8099.) [11] In David: O God, Thou hast cast us off, Thou hast made a breach in us, Thou hast been angry; restore rest to us.

This is said of the rebuilding of the temple in Jerusalem, and the “new temple” there signifies a new church that is to be established by the Lord. This is meant by “Yet once, it is for a little while,” and by “then I will make all nations quake that the choice of all nations may come; and I will fill this house with glory,” “nations” and “the choice of nations” signifying all who are in good (see above, n. 175a, 331), “house” signifying the church, and “glory” Divine truth. This new church is further described by “the temple” in that chapter thus: The glory of this latter house shall be greater than that of the former, for in this place I will give peace (verse 9). The judgment in the spiritual world that will precede is described by “I make the heavens and the earth and the sea and the dry land to quake” “the heavens and the earth” meaning all interior things of the church, and “sea and dry land” all the exterior things of it. [13] In the Gospels: Nation shall be stirred up against nation, kingdom against kingdom; for there shall be pestilences, famines, and earthquakes, in divers places (Matt. 24:7; Mark 13:8; Luke 21:11). “Nation shall be stirred up against nation, and kingdom against kingdom,” signifies that evil is to fight with evil, and falsity with falsity, “nation” signifying the good of the church, and in a contrary sense its evil, and “kingdom” signifying the truth of the church, and in a contrary sense its falsity; “there shall be pestilences, famines, and earthquakes in divers places,” signifies that there will no longer be any goods and truths, and knowledges of good and truth, and thus that the state of the church is changed, which is meant by “an earthquake.” In these chapters of the Gospels the successive states of the church even to its consummation are foretold,but these are described by pure correspondences.

[14] It is recorded also in the Word that there was an earthquake when the Lord suffered upon the cross, and also when the angel descended and rolled away the stone from the mouth of the sepulcher; and each of these earthquakes signified a change in the state of the church. Of the earthquake that occurred when the Lord suffered it is thus written: The veil in the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks were rent. The centurion and they that were with him guarding Jesus, seeing the earthquake and the things that were done, feared exceedingly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God (Matt. 27:51, 54). And of the earthquake that occurred when the angel descended and rolled away the stone from the mouth of the sepulcher it is said: When Mary Magdalene came and the other Mary to see the sepulcher, and behold, there was a great earthquake; for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and coming, rolled away the stone from the mouth, and sat upon it (Matt. 28:1, 2). These earthquakes occurred to indicate that the state of the church was then changed; for the Lord by His last temptation, which He endured in Gethsemane and upon the cross, conquered the hells, and put in order all things there and in the heavens, and also glorified His Human, that is, made it Divine; for this reason “there was an earthquake, and the rocks were rent.” “The veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom” signified that His Human was made Divine; for within the veil was the ark in which was the testimony, and “the testimony” signified the Lord in respect to His Divine Human (see above, n. 392b-e). “The veil” signified the external of the church which was with the Jews and Israelites, and that covered their eyes that they might not see the Lord and Divine truth, or the Word in its own light.

The things that have been said respecting these earthquakes, and the veil of the temple, and the stone before the mouth of sepulcher, are but a few, but the things signified by them are many, for each and everything that is written in the Gospels respecting the Lord’s Passion involves arcana and is significative. The earthquakes mentioned elsewhere in Revelation also signify changes of the state of the church (as chap. 11:13; 16:17–19). 401a. And the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood, signifies that all the good of love was separated, and thence all the truth of faith falsified. This is evident from the signification of “sun” as being in the highest sense the Lord in respect to Divine love, and thence with man the good of love to the Lord from the Lord (of which presently); also from the signification of “black as sackcloth of hair,” as being separated; “black” is predicated of thick darkness, thus of what does not appear from any light. It is said “as sackcloth of hair,” because it means the sensual of man, which is the lowest of the natural, and is thus round about the interiors, in which it induces thick darkness. Man has two minds, a spiritual and a natural; the spiritual mind thinks and perceives from the light of heaven, but the natural mind thinks and perceives from the light of the world; from the latter, man has a light that is called natural light (lumen). This natural mind is what is called the natural man, but the spiritual mind is what is called the spiritual man. As the natural mind is below or outside of the spiritual mind it is also round about it, for it enwraps"

The sensual, which is the ultimate of the natural is also ha the light of heaven like something hairy; from this it is that “hair” signifies the ultimate of the natural man, which is the sensual (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 3301, 5247, 5569–5573). These things have been said that it may be known why it is that “the sun because black as sackcloth of hair.” [2] The above is evident also from the signification of the “moon” as being spiritual truth, which is called the truth of faith (of which presently); also from the signification of “became as blood,” as being that truth was falsified; for “blood” in the genuine sense signifies Divine truth, and in the contrary sense, violence offered to Divine truth, thus Divine truth falsified (that this is the signification of “blood” in the Word, see above, D. 329f); this makes clear what “the moon became as blood” signifies. “The sun” signifies the Lord in respect to Divine love, and thus with man the good of love to the Lord from the Lord, and “the moon” signifies spiritual truth, be cause the Lord in the heaven of celestial angels appears as a sun, and in the heaven of spiritual angels as a moon. His Appearing as a sun is from His Divine love, for Divine love appears as a fire, from which angels in the heavens have their heat; consequently celestial and spiritual “fire” means in the Word, love. The Lord’s appearing as a moon is from the light that is from that sun, for the moon derives her light (lumen) from that sun, and light in heaven is Divine truth, consequently “light” in the Word signifies Divine truth. (But of the Sun and the Moon in the Heavens, and the Heat and Light Therefrom, see what is shown in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 116-125, l26-140.) 401b.

In Matthew: When Jesus was transfigured before Peter, James and John, His face did shine as the sun, and His garment became as light (17:1, 2). Because the Lord was then seen in His Divine, He appeared in respect to His face “as the sun,” and in respect to His garments “as the light,” because the face corresponds to love, and “garments” correspond to truths; and “His face did shine as the sun” because Divine love was in Him, and “His garments became as light” because Divine truth was from Him; for the light in Heaven is Divine truth proceeding from the Lord as a sun. (That “the face” in reference to the Lord means love and every good, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 5585, 9306, 9546, 9888; and that “garments” in reference to the Lord signify Divine truth, see above, n. 64, 195c.) In like manner the Lord appears in heaven before the angels when He presents Himself before them, but He then appears out of the sun. He was therefore seen in like manner by John when he was in the spirit, as appears in Revelation, where it is said that: The face of the Son of man was seen as the sun shineth in his power (1:16). It was evidently the Lord who was seen (see above, n. 63). [4] Likewise when the Lord was seen by John as an angel, respecting which we read: And I saw a strong angel coming down out of heaven, encompassed with a cloud, and a rainbow about his head, and his face was as the sun (Rev. 10:1); for “angels” in the Word in its spiritual sense do not mean angels, but something Divine from the Lord, since the Divine that appears from them is not theirs, but the Lord’s with them. So, too, the Divine truth they speak, which is full of wisdom, they do not speak from themselves, but from the Lord, for they have been men, and men have all wisdom and intelligence from the Lord.

[5] So, too, when the church was represented as a woman, the sun also then appeared around her which is thus described in Revelation: A great sign was seen in heaven; a woman encompassed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crop of twelve stars (12:1). That “the woman” here signifies the church will be seen in the explanation that will be given in what follows. (That “woman” signifies the church, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 252, 253, 749, 770.) And because the church is from the Lord she was seen encompassed with the sun. What is signified by “the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars,” will also be shown in that explanation. [6] It is therefore said by David: The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me, As the light of the morning, when the sun riseth, a morning without clouds, from the brightness after rain (2 Sam. 23:3, 4). “The God of Israel” and “Rock of Israel” here mean the Lord in relation to the church, and in relation to Divine truth therein, “the God of Israel” in relation to the church, and “Rock of Israel” in relation to Divine truth therein; and as the Lord is the sun of the angelic heaven, and the Divine truth proceeding from Him is the light of that heaven, therefore it is said of the Divine which He spoke, which is Divine truth, that it is “as the light of the morning when the sun riseth;” because this is pure, and proceeds from His Divine love, it is added, “a morning without clouds, from brightness after rain,” for the brightness of the light, or of Divine truth proceeding from Him, is from Divine love; “after rain”"

[7] In like manner it is said of those who love Jehovah, in the book of Judges: Let them that love Him be as the going forth of the sun in his might (5:31). That in the Word “Jehovah” means the Lord in relation ta the Divine good of the Divine love may be seen in the Arcana Coelestia (n. 1736, 2921, 3035, 5041, 6303, 6281, 8864, 9315 9373, 10146).

Of such it is also said that “they shall shine as the sun,” in Matthew: The righteous shall shine as the sun in the kingdom of My Father (13:43). In the Word those are called “righteous” who love the Lord that is, from love do His commandments; and in respect to their faces they shine with an effulgence like that of the sun, because the Lord’s Divine love is communicated to them and received by them, whereby the Lord is in their midst, that is, in their interiors, which manifest themselves in the face.

This, too, is said of the Lord, for this whole Psalm treats of Him; and as the Lord appears in heaven to those who are in His celestial kingdom as a sun, and to those who are in His spiritual kingdom as a moon, it is said “they shall fear Thee with the sun and before the moon, a generation of generations;” “in that day the righteous shall flourish, and much peace till the moon be no more,” signifies that those who are in love to the Lord will be in truths from that good, for with those who are in the celestial kingdom, that is, in love to the Lord, truths are implanted; those are called “righteous” who are in the good of love, and “peace” is predicated of that good.

It must be known however, that the falsities of those who are in the light of the moon in the heavens are falsities in which there is no evil, and that such falsities, therefore, are accepted by the Lord as if they were truths (respecting these falsities, see in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, n. 21). This, therefore, is what is signified by “till the moon be no more,” that is, with those who are meant by “the righteous in whom there is much peace.” But in the highest sense, by these words the Lord in relation to His Divine Human, that this shall be the Divine good of the Divine love, is meant, therefore it is also added, “before the sun He shall have the name of Son,” “Son” meaning the Lord’s Divine Human. And as “nations” mean all who are in good, or who receive the good of love from the Lord, it is said, “and all nations shall be blessed in Him.” (That “nations” signify those who are in good, and “peoples” those who are in truths, may be seen above, n. 331.) 401c.

This is said of the last judgment, which is meant by “the day of great slaughter, when the towers shall fall,” “the towers that shall fall” meaning those who are in evils and in falsities therefrom, in particular, those who are in the love of ruling by means of the holy things of the church (see in the work on the Last Judgment, n. 56, 58).

That there shall then be truth in the Lord’s spiritual kingdom, as before there was truth in the celestial kingdom, and that the truth in the celestial kingdom shall then become the good of love is meant by “the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days;” for “light” means Divine truth proceeding from the Lord, “the light of the moon” Divine truth in the spiritual kingdom, and “the light of the sun” Divine truth in the celestial kingdom; “sevenfold” signifies full and perfect, and truth is full and perfect when it becomes good, or good in form. It can be seen that this means, not the sun and moon on the earth, but the sun and moon in the heavens. It is to be known that when a last judgment is being effected the Lord appears in the heavens in much greater effulgence and splendor than at other times, and this because the angels there must be more powerfully defended; for lower things, with which the exteriors of the angels have communication, are then in a state of disturbance. Therefore, as the last judgment is here treated of it is said, “the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days;” and therefore it is also said that “there shall be streams, rivulets of waters, upon every high mountain, and upon every lofty hill,” which signifies abundant intelligence with those who are upon the higher mountains and higher hills, for on the lower mountains and hills is where the judgment then takes place.

That to those in that church the good of love to the Lord and the god of charity towards the neighbor should not perish is meant by “thy sun shall no more go down, and thy moon shall not withdraw;” for to those who are in the good of love to the Lord He appears as a sun, and to those who are in truths from the good of charity towards the neighbor He appears as a moon; so “thy sun” signifies the good of love to the Lord, and “thy moon” the good of charity, which, in its essence, is truth from good. That they shall continue to eternity in truths from the good of love, and in truths from the good of charity is meant by “Jehovah shall be unto thee for a light of eternity, and the days of thy mourning shall be fulfilled,” “the light of eternity” is predicated of those who are in the good of love to the Lord, and “fulfilling the days of mourning” of those who are in the good of charity towards the neighbor, or in truths from good; for with those who were of the ancient churches, “mourning” represented grief on account of the loss or destruction of truth and good; “fulfilled” signifies ended, thus that they shall be in truths from good. From this the signification of “the sun became as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood,” can be seen, namely, that the good of love to the Lord was separated, and thus truth was falsified. [12] Nearly the same is signified in the following passages. In Isaiah: Behold the day of Jehovah cometh, cruel with indignation and the glow of anger, to lay the earth waste; and He shall destroy its sinners out of it. For the stars of the heavens and the constellations thereof do not shine with their light; the sun is darkened in its rising, and the moon maketh not her light to be bright. I will visit evil upon the world, and upon the wicked their iniquity (13:9–11). “The day of Jehovah, cruel with indignation and the glow of anger,” signifies the day of the last judgment; “the stars of the heavens and the constellations thereof do not shine with their light, the sun is darkened in its rising, and the moon maketh not her light to be bright,” signifies that the knowledges of good and truth have perished, as well as the good of love to the Lord, and the good"

The sun is said “to be darkened in its rising,” and the moon “not to make her light to be bright;” not that the sun and moon in the angelic heavens are darkened, for the sun there is always in its effulgence, and the moon in its splendor; but before those who are in evils and in falsities therefrom, goods and truths are thus obscured; it is therefore according to the appearance that it is so said, for those who are in evils and in falsities therefrom turn themselves away from the good of love and charity, consequently from the Lord, and then they will nothing but evil and think nothing but falsity, and those who will and think no other, see nothing but thick darkness and darkness in such things as pertain to heaven and the church. Because such are meant by those with whom “the sun is darkened, and the moon maketh not her light to be bright,” it is said, “to lay the earth waste, and He shall destroy its sinners out of it,” and afterwards, “I will visit evil upon the world, and upon the wicked their iniquity,” “earth” and “world” signifying the church, “laying it waste” signifying that there is no longer any good, and “visiting evil upon the world, and upon the wicked their iniquity,” signifying the last judgment. [13] In Ezekiel: When I shall extinguish thee I will cover the heavens and make the stars thereof black; I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not make her light to shine; all the luminaries of light in the heavens will I make black over thee, and I will give darkness upon thy land (32:7, 8). This is said of Pharaoh king of Egypt, by whom is here signified the natural man separate from the spiritual; which when it is separated is wholly in thick darkness and in darkness in regard to all things of heaven and the church, and so far as it is separated denies them; for the natural man sees nothing in such things from itself, but only through the spiritual man from the Lord, since the"

From this it is clear what is meant by the particulars here, namely, “When I extinguish thee I will cover the heavens” signifies the interiors, which are in the light of heaven; “I will make the stars thereof black” signifies the knowledges of good and truth; “I will cover the sun with a cloud” signifies the good of love to the Lord; “the moon shall not make her light to shine” signifies the good of charity towards the neighbor and the truth of faith therefrom; “all the luminaries of light will I make black over thee” signifies all truths; and “I will give darkness upon thy land” signifies falsities. [14] In Joel: The day of Jehovah cometh. A day of darkness and of thick darkness, a day of cloud and obscurity. Before Him the earth trembleth, the sun and the moon were black, and the stars withdrew their brightness (2:1, 2, 10). The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and terrible day of Jehovah cometh (2:31). The day of Jehovah is near In the valley cut off. The sun and the moon were made black, and the stars withdrew their brightness (Joel 3:14, 15). In the Gospels: Immediately after the affliction of those days the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven (Matt. 24:29; Mark 13:24, 25). In Revelation: The fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars; and the third part of them was darkened, and the day shone not for the third part of it, and the night likewise (8:12)."

It is clear from what has been said above, that in these passages “the sun and moon made black and darkened” means that there was no longer any good or any truth; therefore they are not further explained. 401d. [15] Because such things are signified by “the sun darkened,” therefore the sun was darkened when the Lord was upon the cross, because He was entirely rejected by the church that then was with the Jews, who were consequently in dense darkness, or in falsities. This is thus described in Luke: At the sixth hour darkness came over all the land until the ninth hour, for the sun was darkened (23:44, 45). This was done as a sign and token that the Lord was denied, and that thence there was no good nor truth with those who were of the church; for with them all signs from the heavens represented and signified such things as are of the church, because the church with them was a representative church, or consisted of such things in externals as represented and thus signified the internal things of the church. That “darkness came over all the land” signified that with those who were of the church there was nothing except the falsities of evil, “all the land” meaning all the church, and “darkness” signifying falsities; that it continued for three hours, namely, “from the sixth to the ninth hour,” signifies that there remained mere falsity, and no truth whatever, for “three” signifies full, whole, and entirely, and “six” and “nine” signify all things in the complex, here falsities and evils; and because there were falsities and evils with them, from the Lord’s having been denied, therefore it is said, “and darkness came, and the sun was darkened;” “the sun” that was obscured, meaning the Lord, who is said to be “obscured” when falsities so prevail in the church that He is not acknowledged, and evils so prevail that He is crucified. (That each and every thing related in the Word concerning the Lord’s passion is significative may be seen above, n. 64, 83, 195c at the end.)"

What these words signify in the spiritual sense, may be seen above (n. 372a), where they are explained. In Amos: It shall come to pass in that day, that I will cause the sun to set at noon, and I will darken the earth in a day of light (8:9). This signifies that in the church, where the Word is from which it might be known what is good and true, there is nevertheless nothing but evil and falsity. “To cause the sun to set,” and “to darken the earth,” signify the evil of life, and the falsity of doctrine in the church; for “the rising of the sun” signifies the good of love, which is the good of the life, and “the setting of the sun” signifies the evil of love, which is the evil of the life; and “the darkening of the earth” signifies the consequent falsity of doctrine, “darkness” signifying falsities, and “the earth” the church; “at noon,” and “in the day of light,” signify when there might he the knowledges of good and truth, because they have the Word, “noon” signifying where there are the knowledges of good, and the “day of light” where there are the knowledges of truth. Such knowledges as are from the Word are meant, because it is the church where the Word is that is here treated of. [17] In Habakkuk: The mountains were moved; the overflowing of waters passed by. Sun and moon stood in their habitation; Thine arrows go forth in light, the lightning of Thy spear in brightness (Hab. 3:10, 11). This chapter treats of the Lord’s coming and of the last judgment then accomplished by Him; “the mountains were moved, the overflowing of waters passed by,” signifies that those who were in the love of self and the world were cast out by the falsities of evil"

That by those in that state genuine truths and goods are not seen, but instead of these, fatuous truths and goods, which in themselves are falsities and evils, is signified by, “Thine arrows go forth in light, the lightning of Thy spear in brightness;” “arrows” or “lightnings” signifying fatuous truths, which in themselves are falsities, and “the lightning of the spear” signifying fatuous goods which in themselves are the evils of falsity. Moreover, such signs appear in the spiritual world, in the case of those who are in falsities from the loves of self and the world, when the last judgment takes place, and these are cast out. [18] As in this prophecy it is said, “Sun and moon stood in their habitation,” the significance of the sun’s resting in Gibeon, and the moon in the valley of Aijalon shall also be explained, which is thus described in Joshua: Then spoke Joshua to Jehovah, and he said in the eyes of Israel, Sun, rest thou in Gibeon; and thou, moon, in the valley of Aijalon; and the sun rested, and the moon stayed, until the nation was avenged upon its enemies. Is not this written upon the book of the Upright? And the sun stood in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day (10:12, 13). That the sun is said to have stood in Gibeon, and the moon in the valley of Aijalon, signifies that the church was altogether vastated in respect to all good and truth, for a battle was then going on against the king of Jerusalem and the kings of the Amorites; and “the king of Jerusalem” signifies the truth of the church wholly vastated by falsities, and “the kings of the Amorites” signify the god of the church vastated by evils; therefore those kings were smitten with hailstones, which signify the dire falsities of evil. It is said that the sun and the moon stood in their place, that is, before the sons of Israel, that they might see their enemies; but this, although it is told as history, is a prophecy, as is evident from its being said, “Is not this written upon the book of the Upright?” which was a prophetical book from which this was taken; so it was from the"

This is evident also from the fact that if this miracle had occurred altogether in this way, the whole nature of the world would have been inverted, which is not the case with the other miracles in the Word. That it might be known, therefore, that this was said prophetically, it is added, “Is not this written upon the book of the Upright?” And yet it is not to be doubted, that there was given to them a light out of heaven, a light in Gibeon like that of the sun, and a light in the valley of Aijalon like that of the moon. [19] In Jeremiah: She that hath borne seven shall languish, she shall breathe out her soul; her sun shall go down while it is yet day, it shall be ashamed and blush; and the remnant of them will I give to the sword before their enemies (15:9). “She that hath borne seven shall languish, she shall breathe out her soul,” signifies that the church to which the Word is given and through it all truths, is about to perish; “to hear seven” meaning to be gifted with all the truths of the church (as in the first book of Samuel, 2:5, see above, n. 257). “Her sun shall go down while it is yet day” signifies that the good of the church is about to perish, although the church has the Word, and might through the Word he in light; “it, namely, the sun, shall be ashamed and blush” signifies because good and truth are not received, but evil and falsity (as is evident also from the next quotation from Isaiah); “the remnant of them will I give to the sword before their enemies” signifies that all the remaining good and truth will perish through the falsity from evil; “remnant” meaning all that remains; “to be given to the sword” meaning to perish on account of falsities; “enemies” meaning evils.

Then the moon shall blush, and the sun be ashamed (Isa. 24:21, 23). “To visit” signifies to destroy, because visitation precedes judgment, when those who are in evils and in falsities therefrom are destroyed; “the host of the height in the height” signifies all evils that are from the love of self, “host” signifying all evils; “the kings of the earth” falsities of every kind, and “the earth” the church. This makes clear the signification of “Jehovah will visit upon the host of the height in the height, and upon the kings of the earth who are upon the earth.” It is said “upon the host of the height in the height” because those who are in the love of self seek in the spiritual world high places; “then the moon shall blush, and the sun he ashamed,” signifies that there is no longer any reception of Divine truth and Divine good, “moon” and “sun” signifying the truth of faith and the good of love, and these are said “to blush and be ashamed” when they are no longer received, but falsity and evil are received in their place. [21] In David: Jehovah, who hath made the heavens by His intelligence, who hath spread out the earth upon the waters; who hath made great luminaries, the sun for rule by day, the moon and stars for rule by night: Who hath smitten Egypt in their firstborn, and hath brought out Israel from the midst of them (Ps. 136:5–11). He who knows nothing of the spiritual sense of the Word must suppose that there is nothing involved in these words except what appears in the sense of the letter; and yet every particular involves such things as pertain to angelic wisdom, which are all celestial Divine and spiritual Divine things. This describes the new creation, or regeneration of the men of the church, of whom the church consists; “the heavens” which Jehovah hath made by His intelligence, signify the internal things of the men of the church, which, in one expression, are called the spiritual man, where intelligence has its seat, and where their heaven is; “the earth” which He hath spread out upon the waters, signifies the external of"

The sun is said to have been made “for rule by day,” because “cay” signifies the light of the spiritual man, for the spiritual man has illustration and perception from the good of love; the moon and the stars are said to have been made “for rule by night,” because “night” signifies the light of the natural man, and its light, as compared with the light of the spiritual man, is like the light of night from the moon and the stars as compared with the light of day from the sun. Because this treats of the regeneration of the men of the church it follows, “who hath smitten Egypt in their firstborn, and hath brought out Israel from the midst of them;” “Egypt” signifying the natural man, such as it is by birth, namely, in mere falsities from evil; “their firstborn” mean primary things, the destruction of these while man is being regenerated is meant by “who hath smitten Egypt in their firstborn;” “Israel” signifies the spiritual man; and “to bring him out from the midst of them” signifies to open the spiritual man, and thus to regenerate; for the Lord regenerates the man of the church by dispersing the falsities from evils that are in the natural man, and by opening the spiritual man, and this is effected by the Lord by means of spiritual light, which is Divine truth. 401e.

And because the first state of regeneration is a state of ignorance, the beginning of that feast was “at even, when the sun had set.” Again, that state is signified by “the going forth of the sons of Israel out of Egypt,” for in Egypt they were in a servile state, and thus in a state of ignorance; therefore it is said, “in the stated time of the going forth out of Egypt.” [30] The last state of the church, when the church is in falsities and evils, for this state is its last, is signified by “the setting of the sun” in Moses: When the sun was about setting, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and lo, a horror and great darkness fell upon him. At length, when the sun had set, and it had become dark, behold, a furnace of smoke, and a torch of fire that passed through between these pieces (Gen. 15:12, 17). These things are said of the posterity of Abram from jacob, that is, of the Israelitish and jewish nation; and “when the sun was about setting,” and “at length, when the sun had set,” signify the last state of the church in that nation, that they were in mere falsities and evils; “great darkness” and “a furnace of smoke,” signify falsities from evil; and “a torch of fire” signifies the dire love of self, from which came their evils and falsities. 401g.

This all do who are in the love of self and in the evils and falsities therefrom, for such are merely natural and sensual men, and the merely natural and sensual man does not think beyond nature, for what he does not see and touch he believes to be nothing. With the ancients, all things of the church consisted of the representatives of spiritual things in natural; with them therefore, “the sun” signified the Lord in relation to Divine good, and “the moon” the Lord in relation to Divine truth, consequently in worship they turned their faces to the rising of the sun; and those among them who were in the love of self, and were therefore merely natural and sensual, began to worship as their highest gods the sun and the moon that they saw with their eyes; but because those alone did this, or persuaded others to do it, who were in the love of self and in t.he evils and falsities therefrom, therefore “the sun” signifies the love of self, and “the moon” the falsity therefrom This becomes still more evident in the case of spirits in the other life who in the world bad been such; these turn the face away from the Lord, and turn it towards something there that is dark and in thick darkness, which is in the place of the sun and moon of the world, over against the sun and moon of the angelic heaven (on which more may be seen in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 122, 123). By persons like this the worship of the sun and moon was instituted in ancient times, when all Divine worship was representative; but at this day, when representatives have ceased, the worship of the sun and moon does not exist in the Christian world, but in its place the worship of self, which exists with those in whom the love of ruling predominates. This makes clear the signification of “sun and moon” in the contrary sense. [32] That in ancient times the sun and moon were worshiped is evident from the fact that the Gentiles dedicated shrines to them, which are spoken of in many histories. That the Egyptians as well"

That the Egyptians did, see in Jeremiah: The King of Babylon shall come, and shall smite the land of Egypt, and shall break in pieces the pillars of the house of the sun in the land of Egypt (43:11, 13). That the Jews and Israelites did, see in Ezekiel: I beheld their faces towards the east; and the same bowed themselves towards the rising of the sun (8:16). This treats of the abominations of Jerusalem. In the second book of Kings: Josiah the King put down the idolatrous priests, them that burned incense unto Baal, to the sun, to the moon, and to the stars, and to all of the hosts of the heavens. He furthermore took away the horses that the Kings of Judah had set up to the sun at the entering in of the house of Jehovah, and burned the chariots of the sun with fire (23:5, 11). In Jeremiah: They shall bring out the bones of the Kings of Judah, the bones of his princes, and the bones of his priests, and the bones of his prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and they shall spread them to the sun and the moon and all the host of the heavens, which they have loved, and which they have served (8:1, 2); and also Jer. 44:17–19, 25; Deut. 4:19; 17:3, 5. [33] Because “Moab” in the Word signifies those who are in a life of falsity from the love of self, and their worship signifies the worship of self, therefore when the Israelitish people drew near to the worship of the Moabitish people, it was commanded that the chiefs of the people should be hung up before the sun; respecting which it is thus written in Moses: The daughters of Moab called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods; and the people did eat, and bowed down to their gods."

[34] From this it is also clear that the sun of the world signifies the love of self. Because the love of self lets man down into what is his own (proprium) and holds him there, for it looks continually to self, and man’s own is nothing but evil, and from evil comes every falsity, therefore “the heat of the sun” signifies adulterated truth, which in its essence is the falsity of evil. This is signified by “the heat of the sun” in the following passages. In Revelation: The fourth angel poured out his bowl upon the sun; and it was given unto him to scorch men with fire (16:8). They shall hunger no more, neither shall the sun fall on them, nor any heat (7:16). In David: The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night. Jehovah shall keep thee from all evil, He shall keep thy soul (Ps. 121:6, 7). The “sun” here means the love of self, and the “moon” the falsity therefrom; because from that love is all evil, and from evil all falsity, therefore it is said, “Jehovah shall keep thee from all evil, and He shall keep thy soul,” “soul” signifying the life of truth. [35] In Matthew: Other seeds fell upon the rocky places, where they had not much earth; and when the sun was risen they were scorched, and because they had no root they withered away (13:5, 6,; Mark 4:5, 6)."

This makes clear what is signified by these words of the Lord in series, namely, that the truths that are implanted from infancy from the Word or from preaching, when man begins to think from himself, are adulterated and perish by lusts from the love of self. All things in the Word are, indeed, truths, but they are adulterated by the ideas of thought concerning them, and by the way they are applied, consequently with such persons truths are not truths except in respect to the mere utterance of them. This is so because all the life of truth is from spiritual good, and spiritual good has its seat in the higher or interior mind, which is called the spiritual mind. This mind cannot he opened with those who are in the love of self, for in everything they look to self. If they lift their eyes to heaven, still the thought of their spirit is held in the consideration of self; consequently from the fire of its own glory it incites the external and corporeal sensual things which have been taught from childhood, to the imitation of such affections as belong to the spiritual man. 401h. [36] It is written in Jonah that “the gourd that came up over him withered, and that the sun beat upon his head, so that he fell sick.” As this cannot be understood without explanation by the internal sense, it shall he explained in a few words. It is thus told in Jonah: Jehovah prepared a gourd that came up over Jonah, that it might he a shadow over his head to deliver him from his evil, and Jonah was glad over the gourd. And God prepared a worm, when the dawn came up the following day, and it smote the gourd that it dried up. And it came to pass when the sun arose that God prepared a scorching east wind; and the sun smote upon the head of Jonah, and he fell sick so that he asked that his soul might die. Then God said to Jonah, Is it well for thee to be angry over the gourd? Be said, It is well for me to be angry,"

Jehovah said, Thou wouldest spare the gourd, for which thou hast not labored, nor didst thou make it grow up, because thou didst become the son of the night and the son of night perisheth; shall not I spare Nineveh, the great city, in which are more than twelve myriads of men? (4:6–11). This is a description of the genius of the Jewish nation, that they are in the love of self and in falsities therefrom. Jonah was of that nation, and therefore also was sent to Nineveh; for the Jewish nation had the Word, and was therefore able to teach those who were outside of the church and who are called Gentiles; these are signified by “Nineveh.” Because the Jewish nation was, above others, in the love of self and in the falsities from that love, they did not wish well to any but themselves, thus not to the Gentiles, but these they hated. Because that nation was such, and Jonah represented it, he was very angry that Jehovah should spare Nineveh, for it is said: Jonah was ill with a great illness, so that he was angry, and from the illness of anger he said, Take, O Jehovah, my soul from me, for my death is better than my life (verses 1, 3). This evil in that nation is signified by the gourd which the worm smote so that it dried up. “The sun that smote upon the bead of Jonah” signifies the love of self which was in that nation; and “the scorching east wind” the falsity therefrom; and “the worm that smote the gourd” signifies the destruction of this evil and the falsity thence. That this is the signification of “the gourd” is evident from its being said in this description that Jonah at first “was glad over the gourd,” and after the gourd had been smitten by the worm and had dried up that “he was angry over it, even unto death,” and also from its being said that “he had pity over the gourd.” That the Jewish nation, because it was in such a love and in such falsity therefrom was liable to damnation, is meant by these words to Jonah, “thou didst not cause it to grow up, because thou didst become a son of night, and a son of night perisheth.” (That such was the Jewish nation, see in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem,n. 248.)"

Moreover, the Lord’s Divine love, which is present with everyone, is turned into the love of self with the evil; for everything that flows in is changed in the recipient subject into what agrees with its own nature; as the pure heat of the sun is turned into an offensive smell in subjects of such a nature, and the pure light of the sun into hideous colors in objects of such reception; this is why “the sun that smote upon the head of Jonah” signifies the love of self that is in him; likewise “the sun that was risen” by which the seeds were scorched upon the rocky places, mentioned in Matthew. [38] In Revelation: The city New Jerusalem hath no need of the sun and moon to shine in it, for the glory of God doth lighten it, and the Lamb is the lamp thereof (21:23; 22:5). “The sun” here, of which the city New Jerusalem shall have no need, signifies natural love, which, viewed in itself, is the love of self and the world; and “the moon” signifies natural fight, for natural light, viewed in itself, is from natural love, and the quality of the light is according to the quality of the love; while spiritual love and spiritual light are signified by “the glory of God shall lighten it, and the Lamb is the lamp thereof.” [39] That such is the sense of these words is very evident from the following from Isaiah: The sun shall be no more a light to thee by day, and for brightness the moon shall not give light unto thee; but Jehovah shall be unto thee for a light of eternity, and thy God for thine adornment. Thy sun shall no more go down, and thy moon shall not withdraw; for Jehovah shall be unto thee for a light of eternity, and the days of thy mourning shall be fulfilled (60:19, 20)."

For it is first said, “the sun shall be no more a light to thee by day, and for brightness the moon shall not give light unto thee;” and afterwards it is said, “thy sun shall no more go down, and thy moon shall not withdraw.” From all this it is now evident what “sun and moon” signify in both senses. 402. Verse 13. And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth, signifies that the knowledges of good and truth perished. This is evident from the signification of “stars” as being the knowledges of good and truth (see above, n. 72); also from the signification of “falling unto the earth,” as being to perish; for when stars fall to the earth they perish. The same is signified by: The stars shall fall from heaven (Matt. 24:29; and Mark 13:25). Anyone can see that “stars” here do not mean stars, for these cannot fall from heaven, for they are fixed or established in their place, and cannot fall to the earth, because they are larger than the earth; consequently by them are signified such things as belong to heavenly light, and give light, which are the knowledges of good and truth. Moreover, stars appear in the angelic heaven, but they are appearances from the knowledges of good and truth, therefore they appear about those who are in such knowledges, especially when they turn them over in the mind, and are desirous of knowing them. 403a.

Such is the signification of these words, although they are used comparatively, because in the Word all comparisons, like the rest are significative, for they are equally correspondences. With respect to these things, the case is this: every man is born natural from his parents, but becomes spiritual from the Lord, which is called to be born anew or to be regenerated; and because he is born natural, therefore the knowledges that he imbibes from infancy, before he becomes spiritual, are implanted in his natural memory; but as he advances in years and begins to consider rationally the knowledges of good and truth that he has imbibed from the Word or from preaching, if he is then leading an evil life he eagerly adopts and is imbued with the falsities that are opposite and contrary to these knowledges, and then, because he is endowed with ability to reason, he reasons from falsities against the knowledges of his infancy and childhood, in consequence of which these are cast out, and falsities take their place; this, therefore, is what is signified by “the stars shall fall to the earth as a fig tree casteth her unripe figs when shaken by a great wind.” [2] That “the fig tree” signifies the natural man is from correspondence; for in heaven gardens and paradises are seen, where there are trees of every kind, and each tree signifies something of the Divine that is communicated to angels by the Lord. In general, “the olive” signifies the celestial, which is of the good of love; “the vine” the spiritual, which is of truth from that good; and “the fig tree,” the natural, which is derived from the spiritual or the celestial. And as these trees have this signification they also signify the angel or man in whom such things exist.

From this it can be seen why “the fig tree” is said to signify the natural man, that is, the natural with man. 403b. [3] That “the fig tree” signifies this, and, in general, the external church, is evident also from other passages in the Word, where it is mentioned, as from the following. In Isaiah: All the host of the heavens shall waste away, and the heavens shall be rolled up as a book; and all their host shall fall down as the leaf falleth off from the vine, and as that which falleth from the fig tree (34:4). This is said of the day of the last judgment, which was to come, and which also did come; for the last judgment foretold by the prophets of the Old Testament was accomplished by the Lord when He was in the world; and as the things then done were like those done in the last judgment that is foretold in Revelation, and has at this day been accomplished by the Lord, so nearly the same things are said; as in the prophet Isaiah, that “all the host of the heavens shall fall down, as the leaf falleth off from the vine, and as that which falleth from the fig tree,” likewise that “the heavens shall be rolled up as a scroll;” and in Revelation, that “the stars shall fall unto the earth, as a fig tree casteth her unripe figs,” and that “the heaven shall depart as a book rolled up.” “All the host of the heavens shall waste away” signifies that all goods and truths that are of love and faith are corrupted, “the host of the heavens” meaning all goods and truths that are of love and faith; for the sun, moon, and stars, by which these are signified, are called “the host of the heavens.” “The heavens shall be rolled up as a book” signifies their dispersion; “all the host shall fall down as the leaf from the vine, and as that which falleth from the fig tree,” signifies a laying waste from the falsities of evil.

Evidently “the vine” does not mean a vine, nor “the fig tree” a fig tree, for it is said, “In consuming I will consume them, there shall he no grapes on the vine nor figs on the fig tree,” for they would not be consumed on that account. Moreover, the vastation of the church is what is treated of, as is clearly evident from what there precedes and follows. [5] In Hosea: I will make all her joy to cease, her feast, her new moon, her sabbath. And I will lay waste her vine and her fig tree, whereof she hath said, These are my meretricious hire; and I will make them a forest, and the wild beast of the field shall eat them (2:11, 12). This treats of the churches and of the falsification of truth therein. That the church is treated of is evident from the second verse of this chapter, where it is said, “Plead with your mother; for she is not my wife, and I am not her husband,” “mother” and “wife” meaning the church. Moreover, the holy things of the church, from which worship is performed, and the worship itself, are signified by “the feast, the new moon, and the sabbath,” which shall cease; therefore “I will lay waste her vine and her fig tree” signifies that both spiritual good and natural good are to perish. That “they will be made a forest, and the wild beast of the field shall eat them” signifies that both will be merely natural, and that the spiritual will he consumed by falsities and lusts “forest” signifying the merely natural, and “wild beast of the field” falsities and lusts. And as falsities in the church are especially falsified truths, and these are treated of in this chapter, it is said, “whereof she hath said, These"

And in Micah: In the end of the days it shall be that the mountain of the house of Jehovah shall be established as the head of the mountains; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more; but they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree; and none shall make afraid (4:1, 3, 4). These things are said respecting the Lord’s kingdom, which is with those in the heavens and on the earth who are in love to Him. The Lord’s kingdom is signified by “the mountain of Jehovah, which is established as the head of the mountains,” for “the mountain of Jehovah” signifies the Lord’s kingdom constituted of those who are in love to Him; and as these dwell above the others in the heavens, it is said that this mountain “shall be established as the head of the mountains” (see in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 188).

That through the truths and goods in which they are, they shall be safe from evils and falsities is signified by “they shall sit under their own vine and under their own fig tree, and none shall make afraid.” [13] In Jeremiah: Lo, I will bring upon you a nation from afar, which shall eat up thy harvest and thy bread; and it shall eat up thy sons and thy daughters; it shall eat up thy flock and thy herd; it shall eat up thy vine and thy fig tree (5:15, 17). “A nation from afar” signifies the evil opposed to celestial good, “from afar” signifying apart and remote from, also opposed to, goods and truths; “which shall eat up thy harvest and thy bread” signifies that it will destroy all truths and goods by which there is spiritual nourishment; “which shall eat up thy sons and thy daughters” signifies all the spiritual affections of truth and good; “which shall eat up thy flock and thy herd” signifies truths and goods internal and external; “which shall eat up thy vine and thy fig tree” signifies, thus the internal and the external of the church. [14] In Hosea: I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness; I saw your fathers as the first-ripe in the fig tree in its first season (9:10). “Israel” and “the fathers” do not mean here the fathers of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, but those who were of the ancient church, because they were in good (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 6050, 6075, 6846, 6876, 6884, 7649, 8055); because these were in good, but at the beginning in ignorance of truth, through which, however, good comes, it is said, “I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness; I saw your fathers as a fig tree in its first season,” “grapes” signifying spiritual good, “wilderness” signifying ignorance of truth, and “the"

And He spoke a parable: Behold the fig tree and all the trees; when now they shall have shot forth ye see and shall know of your own selves that summer is now near. So ye also, when ye shall see these things coming to pass know that the kingdom of God is nigh (21:28–31; Matt. 24:32; Mark 13:28, 29). This treats of the consummation of the age, which is the last judgment, and the signs which precede are enumerated, which are meant by “when all these things begin to come to pass;” that a new church is then to begin, which in its beginning will be external is signified by “Behold the fig tree and all the trees, when they have shot forth.” This parable or similitude was related because “the fig tree” signifies the external church, and “trees” signify the knowledges of truth and good; “the kingdom of God,” which then is near, signifies the new church of the Lord; for at the time of the last judgment the old church perishes and a new one begins. [16] In Luke: Every tree is known by its own fruit; for from thorns men do not gather figs, nor from a bramble bush gather they the grape (6:44; Matt. 7:16); as “fruit” signifies the good of life, and the good of life is external good from internal, or natural good from spiritual, and as from this good man is known, so the Lord says, “Every tree is known by its own fruit; from thorns men do not gather figs, nor from a bramble bush gather they the grape,” “fig” here meaning the good of the external or natural man, and “the grape” the good of the internal or spiritual man, “thorns” and “bramble bush” mean the evils opposed to these goods."

From this it can be seen that “the fig tree” in the genuine sense, signifies the natural man in respect to good and truth, the fig itself as a tree the natural man, the fig as a fruit the good of the natural man, and its leaf the truth of that good. 403d. [18] But that “the fig tree” in the contrary sense signifies the natural man in respect to evil and falsity, the fig as a tree the natural man itself, the figs of it as fruit, the evil of that natural man, and its leaf the falsity of that evil, is evident from the following passages. In Jeremiah: Jehovah showed me, and behold, two baskets of figs set before the temple of Jehovah, one basket of very good figs, as of fig trees bearing the firstfruits; and the other basket of very bad figs, that could not be eaten for badness. Jehovah said, As the good figs, so will I recognize those carried away of Judah into the land of the Chaldeans for good; and I will set Mine eyes upon them for good, and I will bring them back upon this land; and I will build them, and I will plant them. And as the bad figs, so will I give them that are left in this land to commotion, and to evil to all nations; and I will send among them the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, that they may be consumed (24:1–10); “the captivity of the Jews in the land of the Chaldeans” means the like as the spiritual captivity or removal of the good from the evil in the spiritual world, according to what has been said above (n. 391a, 392a, 394, 397), namely that those who were inwardly evil, and yet were able to maintain a moral life externally like a spiritual life, remained upon the earth in the spiritual world, and made habitations for themselves there upon the higher places; while those who were inwardly good were removed from them, and concealed"

[19] From this it can be seen what is signified by “the two baskets of figs set before the temple of Jehovah, in one of which were very good figs, as of fig trees bearing the firstfruits, and in the other very bad figs, that could not be eaten for badness,” namely, that those who are inwardly good, of whom a new heaven is to be formed, are meant by “the basket of good figs;” and those who are inwardly evil, who are to be cast down into hell are meant by “the basket of bad figs;” wherefore it is said of the latter that “they could not he eaten for badness,” signifying that such are inwardly evil, while of the former it is said that they were “as fig trees bearing the firstfruits,” signifying that such are inwardly good, so that a new heaven may be formed out of them; for “the fig,” as a fruit, signifies the good of life both in its internal and its external form, and in the contrary sense it signifies the good of life merely in its external form, which is the evil of life, because inwardly it is evil, every external deriving all its quality from its internal, as it is an effect of it. With such, evil appears in externals as good, because they feign good for the sake of the evil that is within, in order to obtain some end, to which the seeming good serves as a means.

[20] That “the fig,” as a tree, in the contrary sense signifies a merely natural man, and a church constituted of such, or those with whom there is no natural good because there is no good within, is evident in Luke: Jesus spoke this parable: A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; he therefore came seeking fruit thereon, but found none. He said unto the vine dresser, Behold, three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, but find none; cut it down, why also doth it make the land unfruitful? But he answering said, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I shall dig about it and dung it, if indeed it will bear fruit; but if not, after that thou shalt cut it down (13:6–9). “The vineyard in which was the fig tree” signifies the church, which contains also such as are in externals; for in the Lord’s church there is both an internal and an external; the internal of the church is charity and the faith therefrom, while the external of the church is the good of life. The works of charity and faith, which are the good of life, belong to the natural man, while charity itself and faith therefrom belong to the spiritual man, therefore “a vineyard” signifies the internal of the church, and “a fig tree” its external. With the Jewish nation there was only the external of the church, since it was in external representative worship; therefore “a fig tree” means the church with that nation; but because they were in external worship and in no internal, being inwardly evil, and external worship without internal is no worship, and with the evil is evil worship, therefore with them there was nothing of natural good. It is therefore said that “for three years he found no fruit on the fig tree, and that he told the vine dresser to cut it down,” which signifies that from beginning to end there was no natural good with that nation, “three years” signifying a whole period, or the time from beginning to end, and “the fruit of the fig tree” signifying natural good; by natural good is meant spiritual-natural good, or good in the natural from the spiritual.

[21] This is the signification of “the fig tree that withered away” when the Lord found no fruit on it, in Matthew: In the morning Jesus returning into the city, hungered. And seeing a fig tree by the way, He came to it, but found nothing thereon but leaves, therefore He said unto it, Let nothing grow on thee henceforward forever; therefore from that time the fig tree withered away (21:18, 19; Mark 11:12–14). Here, too, “the fig tree” means the church with the Jewish nation. That with that nation there was no natural good, but only truth falsified, which in itself is falsity, is signified by “the Lord came to the fig tree, but found nothing thereon but leaves,” “the fruit” which He did not find signifying natural good such as was described above, and “the leaf” signifying truth falsified, which in itself is falsity, for in the Word “leaf” signifies truth, but the leaf of a tree that is without fruit signifies falsity, and with that nation truth falsified, because they had the Word in which truths are, but which they falsified by application to themselves, which was the source of their traditions. That no natural good from a spiritual origin, which is called spiritual-natural good, would be done by that nation is signified by the words that the Lord spoke respecting it, “Let nothing grow on thee henceforward for ever; therefore from that time it withered away;” “to wither away” signifying that there was no longer any good or any truth. The Lord saw the fig tree and said this when He was returning into the city, and hungered, because “the city of Jerusalem” signifies the church, and “hungering,” in reference to the Lord, signifies to desire good in the church (as may be seen above, n, 386h).

[22] A perverted church, or the man of the church perverted in respect to his natural or external man, is also signified by the fig tree, in David: He gave them hail for their rain, a fire of flames in their land; and He smote their vine and their fig tree; He brake the tree of their border (Ps. 105:32, 33). This was said of Egypt, which signifies the natural man that is in falsities and evils; and “vine,” “fig tree,” and “the tree of the border” signify all things of the church, “vine” the internal or spiritual things thereof, “fig tree” the external or natural things thereof, and “the tree of the border” every thing pertaining to knowing and perceiving, “the border” signifying the ultimate in which the interior things close, and in which they are together, and “trees” signifying knowledges and perceptions. Because all these things were perverted and therefore damned, it is said that they were “smitten and broken,” which signifies destruction and damnation; that this was done by the falsities of evil which are from the love of the world is signified by “hail for their rain, a fire of flames in their land,” “rain as hail” signifying the falsities of evil, and “the fire of flames” the love of the world.

This is compared to “fig trees with the first-ripe figs, if they be shaken they fall upon the mouth of the eater,” and this signifies that the goods therein are not goods, however much they may appear to be goods; and that such are not received, or if received are received only in the memory and not in the heart. That “if they be shaken they fall” signifies that they are not goods although they appear to be goods, because they are “the first-ripe figs;” and their falling “upon the mouth of the eater” signifies that they are not received even in the memory. That “the mouth of the eater” signifies non-reception is evident from appearances in the spiritual world; for those who commit anything to memory appear to receive it with the mouth; so “to fall upon the mouth” signifies not to receive even in the memory but only to hear, and also if they do receive, that it is only in the memory and not in the heart. “Fig trees with their first-ripe figs” may also mean genuine goods, of which the like is true as of those who are in the falsities of evil. 404. Verse 14. And the heaven departed as a book rolled up, signifies that the spiritual man became closed up. This is evident from the signification of “heaven,” as being the church in general and in particular; for the church is the heaven of the Lord on the earth; moreover, the church makes one with heaven by conjunction; therefore when “heaven and earth” are mentioned in the Word, the church internal and external is meant, for the internal of the men of the church is heaven with them, and their external is the world with them; and as “heaven and earth” signify the church internal and external so they signify the internal and external man, or the spiritual and the natural man; for as man in whom is the good of love and of faith is a church, so the church, in general exists from the men in whom the church is. This makes clear why it is that “heaven” here means the internal or spiritual man. It is said “the spiritual man,” by which is meant the spiritual mind, which is the higher or interior mind of man, while the lower or exterior mind is called the natural man. The above is evident also from the signification of “departed as a book rolled up,” as meaning that it became closed up; for the spiritual mind, which is,"

That this is so was made very clear by the appearances in the spiritual world when the last judgment was accomplished; for the mountains and the hills there then appeared sometimes to be rolled up as the scroll of a book is rolled up, and those that were upon them were then rolled down into hell. The cause of this appearance was this: that the interiors of their minds, through which somewhat of light from heaven had before flowed in, were then closed up. What takes place in general with many, takes place with everyone in particular of a like character, for in the spiritual world such as the general is, such is the particular (see in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 73). By “book” is meant a scroll, because in ancient times there were no types and thus no books like those at the present day, but there were scrolls of parchments; so “books” in Revelation mean scrolls, and “heaven departed as a book rolled up” means as a scroll rolled up; the same as in Isaiah: All the host of the heavens shall waste away, and the heavens shall be rolled up as a book (34:4). 405a. And every mountain and island were moved out of their places, signifies that every good of love and every truth of faith perished. This is evident from the signification of “a mountain,” as being the good of love to the Lord (of which presently); from the signification of “island” as being the truth of faith (of which in the next article); and from the signification of “to be moved out of their places,” as being to be taken away and to perish, since the good of love and the truth of faith are meant, for when these are moved out of their places, then evils and falsities take their place, and through evils and falsities goods and truths perish. “Mountain” signifies the good of love, because in heaven those who are in the good of love to the Lord, dwell upon mountains, and those who are in charity towards the neighbor dwell upon hills; or, what is the same, those who are of the Lord’s celestial kingdom dwell upon mountains, and those who are of His spiritual kingdom dwell upon hills; and the celestial kingdom is distinguished from the spiritual kingdom in this, that those who are of the celestial kingdom are in"

This is why “mountain” signifies the good of love to the Lord. [2] The good of love to the Lord is meant in an abstract sense by “mountain,” because all things in the internal sense of the Word are spiritual, and spiritual things must he understood in a sense abstracted from persons and places; consequently, because angels are spiritual they think and speak abstractedly from these, and thereby have intelligence and wisdom; for the idea of persons and places limits the thought, since it confines it to persons and places, and thus limits it This idea of thought is proper to the natural, while the idea abstracted from persons and places extends itself into heaven in every direction, and is no otherwise limited than the sight of the eye is limited when it looks up into the sky without intervening objects; such an idea is proper to the spiritual. This is why “a mountain” in the spiritual sense of the Word signifies the good of love. It is similar with the signification of “the earth,” as being the church; for thought abstracted from places, and from nations and peoples upon the earth, is thought respecting the church there or with these; this, therefore, is signified by “earth” in the Word. It is similar with the other things that are mentioned in the natural sense of the Word, as with hills, rocks, valleys, rivers, seas, cities, houses, gardens, woods, and other things. 405b. [3] That “mountain” signifies the love to the Lord, and thus all good that is from that, which is called celestial good, and in the contrary sense signifies the love of self, and thus all the evil that is from that, is evident from the following passages in the Word. In Amos: Dispose thyself towards thy God, O Israel; for lo, He is the Former of the mountains, and the Creator of the spirit, and declareth unto man what is his thought (4:12, 13). God is here called “the Former of the mountains” because “mountains” signify the goods of love, and “the Creator of the"

[4] In David: God who maketh firm the mountains by His power; He is girded with might (Ps. 65:6). Here, too, “mountains” signify the goods of love; these the “Lord maketh firm” in heaven and in the church through His Divine truth, which has all power, therefore it is said “He maketh firm the mountains by His power; He is girded with might.” In the Word “God’s power” signifies Divine truth; and “might” in reference to the Lord signifies all might or omnipotence. (That all power is in the Divine truth that proceeds from the Lord may be seen in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 228–233; and above, n. 209, 333; and that might in reference to the Lord is omnipotence, see above, n. 338.) [5] In the same: I lift up mine eyes to the mountains, whence cometh help (Ps. 121:1). “Mountains” here mean the heavens; and as in the heavens those who are in the goods of love and of charity dwell upon the mountains and hills, as was said above, and the Lord is in these goods, “to lift up the eyes to the mountains” also means to the Lord, from whom is all help.

That this is what “towers” signify is from appearances in the spiritual world, for those who seek to rule by such things as pertain to the church build towers for themselves in high places (see in the small work on the Last Judgment , n. 56, 58).

[10] In the same: Sing aloud ye heavens, shout ye lower parts of the earth, break forth with singing aloud, ye mountains, O forest and every tree therein; for Jehovah hath redeemed Jacob, and hath shown Himself glorious in Israel (44:23). “Sing aloud ye heavens, shout ye lower parts of the earth, break forth with singing aloud ye mountains,” has a like signification as just above; but here “mountains” signify the goods of charity; therefore it is also said, “O forest and every tree therein,” for “a forest” means the external or natural man in respect to all things thereof, and “every tree” means the cognizing and knowing faculty therein; the reformation of these is signified by “Jehovah hath redeemed Jacob, and hath shown Himself glorious in Israel;” “Jacob and Israel” meaning the church external and internal; thus the external and internal with those in whom the church is.

[12] In Isaiah: The wilderness and its cities shall lift up their voice, and the villages that Arabia doth inhabit; the inhabitants of the cliff shall sing aloud, they shall shout from the top of the mountains (42:11). “The wilderness” signifies the obscurity of truth; “its cities” signify doctrinals; “villages” the natural cognitions and knowledges; “Arabia” the natural man, for “an Arabian in the wilderness” means the natural man; “the inhabitants of the cliff” signify the goods of faith, or those who are in the goods of faith; “the top of the mountains” signifies the good of love to the Lord. This makes clear what the particulars signify in their order, namely, confession and joyful worship from the good of love in such things as are mentioned; for “to shout from the top of the mountains” means to worship from the good of love. 405c.

God desireth to dwell in it; yea, Jehovah will inhabit it perpetually (Ps. 68:15, 16). “The mountain of Bashan” signifies voluntary good, such as exists in those who are in the externals of the church; for Bashan was a region beyond Jordan, which was given as an inheritance to the half tribe of Manasseh, as may be seen in Joshua (13:29–32); and “Manasseh” signifies the voluntary good of the external or natural man. This voluntary good is the same as the good of love in the external man, for all good of love is of the will, and all truth"

Because “the mountain of Bashan” signifies that good, “the hills” of that mountain signify goods in act. Because it is the will that acts--for every activity of the mind and body is from the will, as every thing active of thought and speech is from the understanding, therefore the joy arising from the good of love is described and meant by “skipping” and “leaping;” this makes clear what is signified by “a mountain of God is the mountain of Bashan; a mountain of hills is the mountain of Bashan; why leap ye, ye mountains, ye hills of the mountain?” Because the Lord dwells with man in his voluntary good, from which are goods in act, it is said, “God desireth to dwell in it; yea, Jehovah will inhabit it perpetually.” [14] In the same: Judah became the sanctuary of Jehovah. The sea saw it and fled; the Jordan turned itself back. The mountains leaped like rams, the hills like the sons of the flock. What hast thou O sea, that thou fleest? O Jordan, that thou turnest back? ye mountains, that ye leap like rams; ye hills, like sons of the flock? Before the Lord thou art in travail, O earth, before the God of Jacob; who turned the rock into a pool of waters, the flint into a fountain of waters (Ps. 114:2–8). This describes the departure of the sons of Israel out of Egypt; and yet without explanation by the internal sense no one can know what this signifies, as that “the mountains then leaped like rams, and the hills like the sons of the flock,” likewise what is meant by “the sea saw it and fled, and the Jordan turned itself back,” it shall therefore be explained. The establishment of the church, or the regeneration of the men of the church, is here meant in the internal sense, for the church that was to be established is signified by the sons of Israel, its establishment by their departure, the shaking off of evils by the passage through the sea Suph, which is said “to have fled,” and the introduction into the church by the crossing of the Jordan, which is said to have “turned itself back.” But for the particulars: “Judah became a sanctuary, and Israel a domain,” signifies that the good of love to the Lord is the very holiness of heaven and the church, and that truth from that good is that by"

It is said “like rams,” and “like the sons of the flock,” because “rams” signify the goods of charity, and “the sons of the flock” truths therefrom. The establishment of the church from these, that is, the regeneration of the men of the church, is signified by, “before the Lord thou art in travail, O earth, before the God of Jacob; who turned the rock into a pool of waters, and the flint into a fountain of waters;” “earth” meaning the church; and this is said “to be in travail” when it is established or when the man of the church is born anew; it is said “before the Lord” and “before the God of Jacob,” because where the good of love is treated of in the Word the Lord is called “the Lord;” and when goods in act are treated of He is called “the God of Jacob.” Regeneration by truths from goods is signified by “He turned the rock into a pool of waters, and the flint into a fountain of waters;” “pool of Waters” signifying the knowledges of truth, and “fountain of waters” the Word from which these are, and “rock” the natural man in respect to truth before reformation, and “flint” the natural man in respect to good before reformation.

Evidently the bringing forth of the sons of Israel out of Egypt and their introduction into the land of Canaan, from which the nations were expelled, is what is meant by these words; and yet the same words, in the internal sense, mean such things as have been explained; nor was anything else represented and signified by the introduction of the sons of Israel into the land of Canaan, and by the expulsion of the nations from it; for all the historical parts of the Word, as well as its prophetical parts involve spiritual things. [16] In Isaiah: As to all mountains that shall be hoed with the hoe, there shall not come thither the fear of briar and bramble; but there shall be the sending forth of the ox and the trampling of the sheep (7:25). “The mountains that shall be hoed with the hoe” mean those who do what is good from a love of good.

In the same: I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an inheritor of My mountains, that My chosen may possess it and My servants dwell there (65:9). “Jacob” and “Judah” signify the church, “Jacob” the external church, which is in the knowledges of good and truth, and “Judah” the [internal] church which is in the good of love to the Lord; therefore “a seed out of Jacob” signifies the knowledges of good and truth, and thus such as are in these; and “the mountains whose"

[17] In Jeremiah: I will bring the sons of Israel back upon their land. Behold, I will send to many fishers, who shall fish them; and I will send to many hungers, who shall hunt them from upon every mountain and from upon every hill and out of the holes of the cliffs (16:15, 16). This treats of the establishment of a new church, which was represented and signified by the bringing back of the Jews from the captivity out of the land of Babylon into the land of Canaan. He who does not know what is signified by “fishing and hunting,” by “mountain,” “hill,” and “holes of the cliffs,” can gather nothing from these words that he can comprehend That a church was to be established from those who are in natural good and in spiritual good is meant by “I will send fishers who shall fish them, and hunters who shall hunt them.” To gather together those who are in natural good is meant by “sending fishers who shall fish them;” and to gather together those who are in spiritual good is meant by “sending hunters who shall hunt them;” because such are meant it is added, “from upon every mountain and from upon every hill, and out of the holes of the cliffs,” those “upon a mountain” meaning those who are in the good of love, “those upon a hill” those who are in the good of charity; “and those out of the holes of the cliffs” those who are in obscurities respecting truth. [18] In Ezekiel: Ye mountains of Israel, ye shall give forth your branch, and bear your fruit to My people Israel, when they draw near to come (36:8). “The mountains of Israel” signify the goods of charity; that from these are the truths of faith and the goods of life, is signified by “ye shall give forth your branch, and bear your fruit;” “branch” meaning the truth of faith, and “fruit” the good of life."

What these words signify may be seen above (n. 376b), where they are explained. “The mountains” are said” to drop sweet wine,” and “the hills to dissolve,” because “mountains” signify the good of love to the Lord, and “hills” the good of charity towards the neighbor, and “sweet wine” truths; therefore these words signify that from these two goods they shall have truths in abundance, for the bringing back of the people from captivity, about which this is said, signifies the establishment of a new church. 405d. [20] In David: Jehovah, Thy righteousness is like the mountains of God; Thy judgments like a great deep (Ps. 36:6). Because “righteousness,” in the Word, is predicated of good, and “judgment” of truth, it is said that “the righteousness of Jehovah is like the mountains of God, and His judgments like a great deep;” “the mountains of God” signifying the good of charity, and “the deep” truths in general, which are called the truths of faith.

Thou hast set a bound, they pass it not; they return not again to cover the earth. He sendeth forth springs into the brooks, they flow between the mountains.

A new church to be established among the Gentiles is treated of in this chapter, for a new temple is treated of, which signifies a new church. “Chariots coming out from between the mountains” signify doctrine, which is to be formed out of good by means of truths, “chariots” signifying doctrinals, “mountains” the goods of love, and “between mountains” truths from goods; for “valleys,” which are between mountains, signify lower truths, which are the truths of the natural man. That it may be known, that “mountains” here signify the goods of the natural man, it is said, “and the mountains were mountains of copper,” “copper” signifying the good of the natural man.

That the Lord’s coming and the judgment that then took place are treated of in this chapter, is evident from these words in it: Then Jehovah my God shall come, all the holy ones with Thee. And there shall be in that day no light, brightness, nor flashing; and it shall be one day that shall be known to Jehovah, not day nor night; for about the time of evening there shall be light (verses 5–7). “The time of evening” means the last time of the church, when judgment takes place; then it is “evening” to the evil, but “light” to the good. As soon as these things are known, it becomes plain, through the spiritual sense, what the particulars here signify, namely, “Jehovah shall go forth and fight against the nations” signifies the last judgment upon the evil, “to go forth and fight” means to execute judgment, and “nations” the evil; “His feet shall stand upon the Mount of Olives, before the faces of Jerusalem from the east,” signifies that this is effected from the Divine love by means of Divine truths proceeding from His Divine good; “the Mount of Olives” signifying, in reference to the Lord, the Divine love, “Jerusalem,” the church in respect to truths, and therefore the Divine truths of the church, and “the east” the Divine good; “the Mount of Olives shall be cloven asunder, a part thereof toward the east and toward the sea, with a great valley,” signifies the separation of those who are in good from those who are in evil; for “the Mount of Olives,” as was said, means the Divine love; “the east” means where those are who are in Divine good, and “the sea” where those are who are in evil, for in the western quarter of the spiritual world is a sea which separates; “a part of the mountain shall withdraw toward the north, and part of it toward the south,” signifies the separation of those who are in the falsities of evil from those who are in the truths of good; “the north” meaning where those are who are in the falsities of evil, since they are in darkness, and “the south” where those are who are in the truths of good, since they are in light; “then shall ye Bee through the valley of My mountains” signifies that then those who are in truths from good shall be rescued, “to Bee” signifying to be rescued, “the valley of the"

[24] Because “the Mount of Olives,” which was before Jerusalem eastward, signified the Divine love, and “Jerusalem from the east” Divine truth proceeding from Divine good, as was said above, the Lord was accustomed to stay on that mount, as is evident in Luke: Jesus during the days was teaching in the temple; but at night He went out and lodged in the mount that is called the Mount of Olives (21:37; 22:39; John 8:1). It was here, too, that He spoke with His disciples about His coming and the consummation of the age, that is, about the last judgment (Matt. 24:3, seq.; Mark 13:3, seq.). It was from here, also, that Ne went to Jerusalem and suffered (Matt. 21:1; 26:30; Mark 11:1; 14:26; Luke 19:29, 37; 21:37; 22:39); signifying thereby that He did all things from the Divine love, for “the Mount of Olives” signified that love; for whatever the Lord did in the world was representative, and whatever He spoke was significative. The Lord when in the world was in representatives and significatives, in order that He might be in the ultimates of heaven and the church, and at the same time in their firsts, and thus might rule and dispose ultimates from firsts, and thus all intermediates from firsts through ultimates; representatives and significatives are in ultimates. 405e. [25] Because “a mountain” signified the good of love and in reference to the Lord, the Divine good of the Divine love, from which good Divine truth proceeds, so Jehovah, that is, the Lord, descended upon Mount Sinai and promulgated the law. For it is said that: He came down upon that mount, to the top of the mount (Exod. 19:20; 24:16, 17);"

[26] Since “a mountain” signified the good of love, and in the highest sense, the Divine good, and from the Divine good Divine truth proceeds, so Mount Zion was built up above Jerusalem, and in the Word “Mount Zion” signifies the church that is in the good of love to the Lord, and “Jerusalem” the church that is in truths from that good, or the church in respect to doctrine. For the same reason Jerusalem is called “the mountain of holiness,” also “the hill;” for “the mountain of holiness,” likewise “hill” signify spiritual good, which in its essence is truth from good, as can he seen from the following passages. In Isaiah: It shall come to pass in the latter end of days that the mountain of Jehovah shall be on the head of the mountains, and shall be lifted up above the hills; whence all nations shall flow unto it; and many peoples shall go and say, Come ye, let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah, to the house of the God of Jacob (2:2, 3). In that day a great trumpet shall be blown, and the perishing in the land of Assyria shall come, and the outcasts in the land of Egypt, and they shall bow down to Jehovah in the mountain of holiness at Jerusalem (27:13). In Joel: Blow ye the trumpet in 1 Zion, and cry aloud in the mountain of holiness (2:1)."

Respecting this, much is said in the chapters that follow.

The fact that Mount Zion and Jerusalem were built as far as possible according to the form of heaven makes clear what the words cited above from David signify, “Mount Zion on the sides of the north, the city of the great King;” and the words from Isaiah, “The mount of meeting on the sides of the north.” [29] In Isaiah: Sennacherib the king of Assyria said, By the multitude of my chariots I will come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon; where I will cut down the height of its cedars, the choice of its fir trees (37:24). This describes, in the internal sense, the haughtiness of those who wish to destroy the goods and truths of the church by reasonings from falsities; “the king of Assyria” signifies the rational perverted; “the multitude of his chariots” signifies reasonings from the falsities"

This is the meaning of these words in the spiritual sense, consequently in heaven. [30] “Mountain” and “mountains” signify the goods of love and of charity in the following passages also. In David: Jehovah who covereth the heavens with clouds, who prepareth rain for the earth, who maketh grass to spring forth upon the mountains (Ps. 147:8). “The clouds,” with which Jehovah covers the heavens, signify external truths, such as are in the sense of the letter of the Word; for the truths in that sense are called in the Word ”clouds,” while the truths in the internal sense are called “glory”; “the heavens” mean internal truths, because those who are in the heavens are in them; “the rain which He prepares for the earth” signifies influx of truth, “the earth” meaning the church, and thus those there who receive truth, for the church consists of such; “the mountains on which He makes grass to spring forth” signify the goods of love, and thence those who are in the goods of love, “grass” signifying the spiritual nourishment that such have; for grass for beasts is meant, and “beasts” signify the affections of good of the natural man. 405f.

Those who are ignorant of what is represented by “Joseph” and “his tribe,” and also by “dew,” “the deep that lieth beneath,” “the mountains of the east,” and “the hills of an age,” can know scarcely anything of what such words involve, and, in general, can know scarcely anything of the significance of what is said by Moses in this whole chapter respecting the tribes of Israel, and of what is said by Israel the father in Genesis 49.

(18:12). It is said, “will he not leave the ninety and nine in the mountains?” for “sheep in the mountains” signify those who are in the good of love and charity; but “the one that is gone astray” signifies one who is not in that good, because he is in falsities from ignorance; for where falsity is, there good is not, because good is of truth. [34] In the Gospels: When ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, then let them that are In Judea flee to the mountains; and let him that is on the roof not go down into the house (Mark 13:14, 16; Matt. 24:16–17; Luke 21:21). In those chapters the Lord describes the successive vastation of the church, but it is described by pure correspondences. “When ye shall see the abomination of desolation” signifies when the disciples, that is, those who are in truths from good, perceive the church to be devastated, which takes place when there is no longer any truth because there is no good, or no faith because there is no charity; “then let them that are in Judea flee to the mountains” signifies that those who are of the Lord’s church are to remain in the good of love, “Judea” signifying the Lord’s church, and “mountains” the goods of love; “to flee to them” means to remains in those goods; “let him that is on the roof not go down into the house” signifies that he that is in genuine truths should remain in them, “house” signifying a man in respect to all the interior things which belong to his mind, and “the roof of the house” signifying therefore the intelligence that is from genuine truths, thus also the genuine truths through which there is intelligence. Unless the particulars of what the Lord said in these chapters of the Gospels are illustrated by the spiritual sense, scarcely anything that is contained there can be known, thus when it is said “let him that is on the roof not go down into the house;” or in another place, “let not him that is in the field return back to take his garments;” and many other things."

[35] Thus far it has been shown that “mountains” signify in the Word the goods of love; but as most things in the Word have also a contrary sense, so do “mountains,” which in that sense signify the evils of the love, or the evils that spring forth from the loves of self and the world, Mountains are mentioned in this sense in the following passages in the Word. In Isaiah: The day of Jehovah of Hosts shall come upon everyone that is proud and exalted, and upon all the exalted mountains, and upon all the hills that are lifted up (2:12, 14). “The day of Jehovah of Hosts” means the last judgment, when the evil were cast down from the mountains and hills which they occupied in the spiritual world, as was said in the beginning of this article. It is because such before the last judgment dwelt upon mountains and bills, that “mountains and hills” mean the loves and the evils therefrom in which they were, “mountains” the evils of the love of self, and “hills” the evils of the love of the world, It is to be known that all who are in the love of self, especially those who are in the love of ruling, when they come into the spiritual world, are in the greatest eagerness to raise themselves into high places; this desire is inherent in that love; and this is why “to be of a high or elated mind” and “to aspire to high things” have become expressions in common use. The reason itself that there is this eagerness in the love of ruling is that they wish to make themselves gods, and God is in things highest. That “mountains and hills” signify these loves, and thence the evils of these loves, is clear from its being said, “a day of Jehovah of Hosts shall come upon everyone that is proud and exalted, and upon all the exalted mountains, and upon all the hills that are lifted up;” what else could be meant by “coming upon the mountains and hills?” [36] In the same: The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of Jehovah, make level a highway for our God. Every valley shall be lifted up, and every mountain and hill shall be made low (40:3, 4)."

[37] In Ezekiel: For I will make the land a desolation and wasteness, that the pride of strength may cease; and the mountains of Israel have been laid waste, that none may pass through (33:28). This describes the desolation and vastation of the spiritual church, which the Israelites represented; for the Jews represented the Lord’s celestial kingdom, or the celestial church, while the Israelites represented the Lord’s spiritual kingdom, or the spiritual church. Its “desolation and vastation” signifies the last state of the spiritual church, which was when there was no longer any truth because there was no good, or, when there was no faith because no charity; “desolation” is predicated of truth which is of faith, and “vastation” of good which is of charity. Boasting and elation of mind from falsities that they call truths, is signified by “the pride of strength,” “strength” and “power” having reference to truths from good, because all strength and all power belong to such truths; here, however, they have reference to falsities, because of the boasting and elation of mind. That there was no longer any good of charity and faith is signified by “the mountains of Israel have been laid waste;” that there was no good whatever, but only evil, is signified by “that none may pass through.” [38] In the same:"

Here, too, “mountains of Israel” signify the evils that proceed from the love of self and of the world, which exist with those who are in the spiritual church, when they no longer have any good of life, but only evil of life and the falsity of doctrine therefrom; “mountains,” “hills,” “water courses,” and “valleys,” signify all things of the church, both interior or spiritual and exterior or natural, “mountains and hills” signifying things interior or spiritual, “water courses and valleys” things exterior or natural; that these will perish through falsities is signified by “Behold I will bring the sword upon you,” “sword” meaning the destruction of falsity by truths, and in a contrary sense, as here, the destruction of truth by falsities, [39] In the same: In the day in which God shall come upon the ground of Israel, the fishes of the sea, and the fowl of the heavens, and the wild beast of the field and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the ground, and every man who is upon the faces of the ground, shall quake before Me, and the mountains shall be thrown down, and the steps shall fall, and every wall shall fall to the earth; then I will call for the sword against him unto all My mountains (38:18, 20, 21).

It is said, “with His people,” “with Israel,” because “people” means those who are in truths, or those who are in falsities; and “Israel” those who are in goods, or those who are in evils.

It is said that “a fire hath been kindled in Jehovah’s anger, which shall burn even unto the lowest hell,” although Jehovah has no fire of anger, much less one that burns to the lowest hell; for Jehovah, that is the Lord, is angry with no one, and does evil to no one, neither does He cast anyone into hell, as may be seen in the work on Heaven and Hell (n. 545–550); but it is so said in the sense of the letter of the Word, because it so appears to an evil man, and also to a simple man, for the Word in the letter is according to appearance, because according to the apprehension of natural men. But as angels, who are spiritual, see the truths themselves of the Word, not apparently according to the apprehension of man, but spiritually, therefore with the angels the sense of such expressions is inverted, and this is the internal or spiritual sense, that is, that the infernal love with man is such a fire, and burns even to the lowest hell; and as that fire, that is, that love, destroys all things of the church with man, from the very foundation, therefore it is said that “it shall devour the earth and its produce, and shall set in flames the foundations of the mountains,” “the earth” meaning the church, “its produce” everything of the church, “the foundations of the mountains” the truths upon which the goods of love are founded, and these are said “to be set in flames” by the fire of the love of self and the world.

      "text": "APOCALYPSE EXPLAINED 1209 405i. [53] In the Gospels: Jesus saith unto the disciples, Have the faith of God; verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall say unto [this] mountain, Be thou taken up and cast into the sea, and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass, what he hath said shall be done for him (Mark 11:22, 23; Matt. 17:20). One who is ignorant of the arcana of heaven and of the spiritual sense of the Word, might believe that the Lord said this, not of saving faith, but of another faith that is called historical and miraculous; but the Lord said this of saving faith, which faith makes one with charity and is wholly from the Lord, therefore the Lord calls this faith “the faith of God;” and because it is by this faith, which is the faith of charity from Him, that the Lord removes all evils flowing from the loves of self and of the world and casts them into hell from which they came, so He says, “Whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou taken up and cast into the sea, what he hath said shall he done;” for “mountain” signifies the evils of those loves, and “sea” signifies hell; therefore “to say to a mountain, Be thou taken up,” signifies the removal of those evils, and “to be cast into the sea” signifies to be cast into the hell from which they came. Because of this signification of “mountain” and “sea,” this came to be a common expression with the ancients when the power of faith was the subject of discourse; not that that power can cast the mountains on the earth into the sea, but it can cast out the evils that are from hell. Moreover, the mountains in the spiritual world upon which the evil dwell are often overturned and cast down by faith from the Lord; for when the evils with such are east down, the mountains upon which they dwell are also cast down, as has been several times said before; and this has often been seen by me. That no other faith than the faith of charity from the Lord is here meant is evident from what follows in the Lord’s discourse in Mark, where it is said: Therefore I say unto you, All things whatsoever that praying ye ask for, believe that ye are to receive, and it shall be done for you. But when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have aught against any, that your Father also who is in the heavens may forgive you your trespasses. But if ye"

This makes evident that”the faith of God,” of which the Lord here speaks, is the faith of charity, that is, the faith that makes one with charity, and is therefore wholly from the Lord. Moreover, the Lord said these things to the disciples when they supposed that they could do miracles from their own faith, thus from themselves; nevertheless such things are done by faith from the Lord, thus by the Lord (as is also evident from Matthew 17:19, 20, where like things are said). [54] Because “mountains” signified the goods of celestial love, and “hills” the goods of spiritual love, the ancients, with whom the church was representative, had their Divine worship upon mountains and hills, and Zion was upon a mountain, and Jerusalem on mountainous places below it. But that the Jews and Israelites, who were given to idolatry, might not turn Divine worship into idolatrous worship, it was commanded them that they should have their worship in Jerusalem only, and not elsewhere; but because they were idolaters at heart they were not content to have their worship in Jerusalem, but after a custom of the nations derived from the ancients they everywhere held worship upon mountains and hills, and sacrificed and burnt incense thereon; and because this was idolatrous with them, worship from evils and falsities was signified by their worship upon other mountains and hills; as in the following passages. In Isaiah: Upon a mountain high and lifted up hast thou set thy bed; thither also wentest thou up to sacrifice sacrifices (57:7). In Hosea: They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the hills (4:13). In Jeremiah:"

In these passages, therefore, worship upon mountains and hills signifies worship from evils and falsities. From this, also, it came that the nations in Greece placed Helicon on a high mountain, and Parnassus on a hill blow it, and believed that their gods and goddesses dwelt there; this was derived from the ancients in Asia, and especially those in the land of Canaan, who were not far away, with whom all worship consisted of representatives. [55] It is said in the Gospels: The devil took Jesus up into a high mountain, and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory, and tempted Him there (Matt. 4:8; Luke 4:5). This signifies that the devil tempted the Lord through the love of self, for this is what “the high mountain” signifies; for the three temptations described in these passages signify and involve all the temptations that the Lord endured when He was in the world; for the Lord, by temptations admitted into Himself from the hells and by victories then, reduced all things in the hells to order, and also glorified His Human, that is, made it Divine. All the Lord’s temptations were described so briefly, since He has revealed them in no other way; but yet they are fully described in the internal sense of the Word. (Respecting the Lord’s temptations see what is cited in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, n. 201, 293, 302.) 406a.

The truths of the natural man are true knowledges, which are under the intuition of the rational man, and the cognitions of truth which are under the intuition of the spiritual man; the cognitions of truth are such as the natural man knows from the Word, while true knowledges are such as the natural man sees from the rational, and by which he is accustomed to confirm the truths of the church. There are with man two minds, one higher or interior which is called the spiritual mind, and the other lower or exterior which is called the natural mind. The natural mind is first opened and cultivated with men, because this most nearly stands forth in the world; and afterwards the spiritual mind is opened and cultivated, but only to the extent that man receives in the life the cognitions of truth from the Word, or from doctrine from the Word; consequently with those who do not apply knowledges to the life it is not opened. But when the spiritual mind is opened the light of heaven flows in through that mind into the natural mind and enlightens it, whereby the natural mind becomes spiritual-natural; for the spiritual mind then sees in the natural almost as a man sees his face in a mirror, and acknowledges the things that are in agreement with itself. But Men the spiritual mind is not opened, as is the case with those who do not apply to their life the cognitions of truth and good that are in the Word, there is nevertheless formed in man a mind in the interior part of the natural; but this mind consists of mere falsities and evils; because the spiritual mind, by which the light of heaven is let into the natural by a direct way is not opened; but [light is let in] only through chinks round about; from this a man has the faculty to think, reason, and speak, and also the faculty to understand truths, but not the faculty to love them, or to do them from affection. For the faculty to love truths because they are truths"

This makes clear that a man in whom the spiritual mind is opened is like a garden and a paradise; but a man in whom the spiritual mind is not opened is like a wilderness, and like land covered with snow. Because the mind makes the man (the mind consisting of understanding and will) it is the same whether you say the mind or the man, thus whether you say the spiritual and natural mind or the spiritual and natural man. 406b. The natural mind or natural man, in respect to its truths and its falsities, is signified by “islands” in the Word, in respect to truths with those in whom the spiritual mind is opened, and in respect to falsities with those in whom the spiritual mind is closed. [2] That these are signified by “islands” can be seen from the following passages in the Word. In Ezekiel: Thus said the Lord Jehovih to Tyre: Shall not the islands quake at the sound of thy fall, when the wounded shall groan, when the slaughter shall be accomplished in the midst of thee? And all the princes of the sea shall come down from 1 their thrones. The islands shall tremble in the day of thy fall, and the islands that are in the sea shall be affrighted at thy departure. All the inhabitants of the islands were astonished at thee, and their kings shuddered shuddering, their faces were troubled (26:15, 16, 18; 27:35). These two chapters treat of Tyre, which signifies the church in respect to the knowledges of truth and good, and in an abstract sense the knowledges of truth and good. In the first place the intelligence and wisdom of the men of the church through the knowledges of truth and good from the Word is treated of, and afterwards the church vastated in respect to these. The church vastated in respect to these, or where the knowledges of truth and"

That all knowledges that man from his infancy has imbibed from the Word, also all true knowledges by which be has confirmed them, are then disturbed, moved out of their place, and recede, is signified by “the islands shall tremble, and all the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones,” also by “the islands shall tremble in the day of thy fall, and the islands that are in the sea shall be affrighted,” “islands” meaning these cognitions and knowledges in the natural man; “the princes of the sea” primary things therein, “sea” signifying the natural man and all things therein in general. That all goods of truth of the natural man, because of the vastation of the knowledges of truth, shall be changed as to their state, is signified by “all the inhabitants of the islands were astonished at thee, and their kings shuddered, their faces were troubled;” “the inhabitants of the islands” mean the goods of truth of the natural man, for “to inhabit,” in the Word, signifies to live, and “inhabitants” the goods of life; “kings” mean all truths from good; “faces” signify the interiors and the affections; “to be astonished,” “affrighted,” and “troubled,” signify to be entirely changed as to state. This makes clear what these things involve in the internal sense, namely, that all cognitions of truth and good and the confirming knowledges that man from infancy has imbibed from the Word and from teachers, will change their places and their state in the natural man and perish out of sight when falsities enter. [3] In Isaiah: The king of Assyria shall lead the captivity of Egypt and the crowd of Cush that is to be carried away; then shall they be dismayed and ashamed because of Cush their expectation, and because of Egypt their adornment; and the inhabitant of this island shall say in that day, Behold, such is our expectation, whither we flee for help to be delivered from before the king of Assyria; and how shall we escape?

But these words in a purely spiritual sense, signify that the internal man shall teach the external, or the spiritual the whole natural man, the truths of the Word, for it is this that “the nations declare in the islands afar off;” but this pure sense, which is for angels, is with difficulty perceived by men, for it is with difficulty that men can think abstractedly from persons and places, for the reason that the thought of men is natural, and natural thought differs from spiritual thought in this, that it is tied down to places and persons and is consequently more limited than the spiritual.

This, in the internal sense, signifies that the falsities of evil will be dispersed, and truths and goods given to those who are in falsities indeed, but not in the falsities of evil; “the gods of the nations that He will make lean” signify the falsities of evil, “gods” signifying falsities, “nations” evils, and “to make lean” to remove evils from falsities; “the islands of the nations” and “the Kushites” signify those who are in falsities indeed, but not in the falsities of evil; and in an abstract sense they signify falsities, but not falsities of evil; and as falsities not of evil are in the natural man, therefore “the islands of the nations” signify the natural man in respect to such falsities, or in respect to falsities in the natural man; these falsities are signified by “slain by My sword.” (Respecting the falsities of evil, and the falsities not of evil, see in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, n. 21.)

This is said respecting the Lord; and “to have dominion from sea to sea, and from the river even unto the uttermost parts of the earth,” means His dominion over all things of heaven and the church; for the boundaries in the spiritual world are seas, and the intermediate regions are lands, where there are habitations for angels and spirits; therefore “from sea to sea” signifies all things of heaven, and because all things of heaven, it signifies also all things of the church; for the goods of love and the truths therefrom are what constitute both heaven and also the church, so “from sea to sea” signifies also all things of the church. All things of heaven and of the church are signified by “from the river even unto the uttermost parts of the earth;” but this signifies all things of heaven and of the church in respect to truths, while “from sea to sea” signifies all things of heaven and of the church in respect to goods; for in the spiritual world the seas are the boundaries of the land east and west, and in the lands from the east to the west those dwell who are in the good of love; while “the river” means the first boundary, and “the uttermost parts of the earth” the last boundaries from south to north, where those dwell who are in truths from good; these boundaries were represented in respect to the land of Canaan by the rivers Jordan and Euphrates. Because the places that are about the last boundaries arc meant by “islands,” these signify truths in last things; and these, although they are not truths, are accepted as truths; for genuine truths are diminished from the midst towards the borders, since those who are about the borders are in natural light, and not so much in spiritual light. “Enemies” signify evils, of whom it is said that they “shall lick the dust,” that is, that they are damned.

This is so called from a sea in which there are islands, for “the sea” signifies the generals of truth, or the truths of the natural man in general. This is the signification of “islands” in Genesis: The sons of Javan were Elisha and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim. From these were the islands of the nations separated in their lands; everyone after his tongue, after their families, in their nations (10:4, 5). And in Isaiah: He will come to gather all nations and tongues that they may come and see My glory; and I will set a sign among them, and I will send those of them that escape unto the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, that draw the bow, to Tubal, and Javan, to the islands afar off, that have not heard My fame neither have seen My glory; and they shall declare My glory among the nations (66:18, 19; likewise 11:10, 11). 406e. [19] As most things in the Word have also a contrary sense, so have islands; and in this sense “islands” signify the falsities opposed to the truths in the natural man. In this sense “islands” are mentioned in the following passages. In Isaiah:"

And the kings of the earth, and the great ones, and the rich, and the commanders of thousands, and the mighty, signify all internal goods and truths, and all external goods and truths, by means of which there are wisdom and intelligence. This is evident from the signification of “kings,” as being truths from good in their whole complex (of which above, n. 31); from the signification of “great ones, and the rich,” as being internal goods and truths (of which presently); from the signification of “commanders of thousands and the mighty” as being external goods and truths; “commanders of thousands” meaning such goods, and “the mighty” such truths (of which also presently). It is added, “by means of which there are wisdom and intelligence,” because from internal goods and truths, which are spiritual goods and truths, there is wisdom, and from external goods and truths, which are natural goods and truths from spiritual, there is intelligence. Wisdom differs from intelligence in this, that wisdom is from the light of heaven, and intelligence from the light of the world enlightened by the light of heaven; this is why wisdom is predicated of spiritual goods and truths, and intelligence of natural goods and truths; for spiritual goods and truths are from the light of heaven, because the spiritual mind or the internal mind is in the light of heaven; and natural goods and truths are from the light of the world, because the natural or external mind is in the light of the world; but so far as this mind receives the light of heaven through the spiritual mind, so far it is in intelligence.

Yet that it may be known how these things are to be understood, see what is said in a preceding article (n. 4O6a), namely, that man has two minds, the one spiritual or internal, the other natural or external, and that the spiritual or internal mind is opened with those who apply the goods and truths of the Word to the life, while in those who do not apply the goods and truths of the Word to the life, that mind is not opened, but only the natural or external mind; such are thence called natural men, but the former spiritual. To this let it be added, that so far as the spiritual or internal mind is opened, spiritual light, which is the light of heaven, flows in through it from the Lord into the natural or external mind, and enlightens that mind and gives intelligence. The goods and truths that constitute the spiritual or internal mind are meant by “the great ones and the rich,” goods by “the great ones,” and truths by “the rich;” and the goods and truths that constitute the natural or external mind are meant by “the commanders of thousands and the mighty,” these goods by “the commanders of thousands,” and these truths by “the mighty.” This makes clear that these words, in the internal sense, include all things that are with man; for the extinction of all these is treated of in what follows. All things with man as well as all things in the universe have reference to good and truth; it is from these and according to these that man has all wisdom and intelligence.

In no other way could angels be conjoined with men, for the angels are spiritual because they are in the spiritual world and thus both think spiritually and speak spiritually; while men are natural, because they are in the natural world, and thence think naturally and speak naturally. This is said to make known that “the kings of the earth, the great ones, the rich, the commanders of thousands, and the mighty,” signify also things spiritual. That these mean spiritual things, namely, “the great ones and the rich” internal goods and truths, find “the commanders of thousands and the mighty” external goods and truths, can he seen from their signification where they are mentioned in the Word. [3] “Great ones” in the Word signify internal goods which are the goods of the internal or spiritual man, because “great” and “greatness” in the Word are predicated of good, and “many” and “multitude” of truth (see above, n. 336a, 337). Internal goods are signified by “great ones,” because these four, namely, “great ones,” “the rich,” “the commanders of thousands” and “the mighty” signify all the goods and truths that are with man, thus the goods and truths both of the internal or spiritual man and of the external or natural man; “the great ones and the rich” meaning the goods and truths of the internal or spiritual man, and “the commanders of thousands and the mighty” the goods and truths of the external or natural man; so it is added, “every servant and every freeman,” “servant” signifying the external of man, which is called the natural man, and “freeman” the internal of man, which is called the spiritual man. Like things are signified by “great ones” elsewhere in the Word (namely in Jeremiah 5:5; in Nahum 3:10; and in Jonah 3:7). That “the rich” signify internal truths, which are spiritual truths or those who are in such truths, is evident from what has been shown above (n. 118, 236).

But that “the mighty” signify external truths, or truths of the natural man, is evident from many passages in the Word, where “the mighty” and “the strong,” likewise “power” and “strength” are mentioned; this is because truths from good, and indeed truths that are in the natural man, have all power. Truths from good are what have all power, because good does not act of itself, but by truths, for good forms itself in truths, and clothes itself with them, as the soul does with the body, and so acts; it acts by truths in the natural man, because there all interior things are together, and in their fullness. (That truths from good, or good by means of truths, has all power may be seen above, n. 209, 333; and in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 231, 232, 539; and that all power is in ultimates, because the Divine is there in its fullness, see above, n. 346; and Arcana Coelestia, n. 9836, 10044.) From this it can be seen that “the mighty” mean external truths, or truths of the natural man. 409a. And every servant, and every freeman, signifies the natural man and the spiritual man. This is evident from the signification of “servant,” as meaning the natural man (of which presently); and from the signification of “freeman,” as meaning the spiritual man. The spiritual man is meant by “freeman” and the natural man by “servant” because the spiritual man is led by the Lord from heaven, and to be led by the Lord is freedom; while the natural man obeys and serves the spiritual, for it executes what the spiritual man wills and thinks. “Servant” is mentioned in many passages in the Word; and one who does not know that in these “servant” means what does service and effects the things the spiritual man wills and thinks, might suppose that “servant” there means one who is in servitude, thus he might understand it in its ordinary sense, but it will be plain from the passages in the Word that will presently he cited that it means what does service and effects. When “servant” is mentioned in the Word in this sense, the natural man is meant by it, which is “a servant” in the same sense as the body is a servant to its soul, As what does service and effects is meant by “servant,” so “servant” is predicated not only of the natural man in its relation to the spiritual, but also of men who perform service for others and of"

But with those with whom the spiritual man is closed and the natural man only open, the whole man in a general sense is a servant, although in appearance it is like a freeman; for the exterior natural man is subservient to the evils and falsities which the interior wills and thinks, and is thus led by hell, and to be led by hell is to be altogether a servant, and after death such a man also becomes altogether a servant and vile slave in hell; for after death the delights of everyone’s life are changed into things that correspond, and the delights of evil are changed into servitude and into loathsome things (see in the work on Heaven and Hell, n, 485–490). In this sense also “servant” is mentioned in the Word, But here it shall be shown especially that “servant” means what is of service and what effects, and this in every respect. 409b. [2] That “servant” means what is of service and effects is plainly evident from this, that the Lord in relation to His Divine Human is called “servant” and “minister,” as in the following passages. In Isaiah: Behold My servant, on whom I lean, My chosen, in whom My soul Is well pleased; I have given My spirit upon Him. [He shall bring forth judgment to the nations]. Who is blind but My servant? or deaf as My angel that I send? Who is blind as He that is perfect, and blind as My servant? (42:1, 19). This is said of the Lord, who is treated of in the whole of this chapter, and the Lord in respect to His Divine Human is here called “a servant,” because He served His Father by doing His will, as He frequently declares; and this means that He reduced to order"

Therefore by “My servant on whom I lean,” and by “My chosen, in whom My soul is well pleased,” the Divine Human is meant; and this is called “a servant” from the Divine truth by which it produced effects, and “chosen” from the Divine good. That it was by means of the Divine truth which belonged to Him that the Lord produced effects is meant by “I have given My spirit upon Him, He shall bring forth judgment to the nations;” “the spirit of Jehovah” meaning the Divine truth, and “to bring forth judgment to the nations” meaning to instruct. He is called “blind” and “deaf” because the Lord is as if He did not see and perceive the sins of men, for He leads men gently, bending and not breaking, thus leading away from evils, and leading to good; therefore He does not chastise and punish, like one who sees and perceives. This is meant by “who is blind but My servant? or deaf as My angel?” He is called “blind” and hence “a servant” from the Divine truth, and “deaf” and hence “an angel” from the Divine good; for “blindness” has reference to the understanding and thence to the perception, and “deafness” to the perception and thence to the will; it is therefore here meant that He as it were does not see, although He possesses the Divine truth from which He understands all things, and that He does not will according to what He perceives, although He has the Divine good, from which He is able to effect all things.

This, too, is said of the Lord, of whom the whole chapter evidently treats, and indeed of His Divine Human. His combats with the hells and His subjugation of them are signified by “the labor of His soul,” and “He hath borne their iniquities;” “hearing their iniquities” means not that He transferred them unto Himself, but that He admitted into Himself evils from the hells that He might subdue them; this therefore is what is meant by “bearing iniquities.” The consequent salvation of those who are in spiritual"

It is said that “He shall justify” these, because “to justify” signifies to save by Divine good, and from Divine good He is also called “just.” Because the Lord accomplished and effected these things by His Divine Human, He is called “the servant of Jehovah;” this makes clear that Jehovah calls His Divine Human “His servant,” because of its serving and effecting.

Here, too, “servant” means the Lord in respect to His Divine Human.

[5] Since “David” in the Word means the Lord in respect to Divine truth, and Divine truth serves, so David also, where the Lord is meant by him, is in many places called “a servant,” as in Ezekiel: I Jehovah will be their God, and My servant David a prince in the midst of them (34:24). My servant David shall be king over them, that they all may have one shepherd (37:24). This was said of David after his times, when he was never again to be raised up to be a prince in the midst of them, or a king over them. In Isaiah: For I will defend this city to save it for Mine own sake, and for My servant David’s sake (37:35).

The Lord is also called “a servant” in the Word where He is meant by “Israel.” As in Isaiah: Thou art My servant, O Israel in whom I will he made glorious. It is a light thing that thou shouldst be My servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to lead back the preserved of Israel; but I have given thee for a light to the nations, that thou mayest be My salvation unto the end of the earth (Isa. 49:3, 6).

[6] Since the Lord in respect to Divine truth is called in the Word “a servant” from serving, so those who are in Divine truth from the Lord and thereby serve others are there called “servants,” as the prophets are in these passages. In Jeremiah: Jehovah sent unto you all His servants the prophets (25:4). In Amos: He hath revealed His secret unto His servants the prophets (ill. 7). In Daniel: He hath set [His laws] before us by the hand of His servants the prophets (9:10). So too: Moses is called The servant of Jehovah (Mal. 4:4).

[Deal well with Thy servant.] Thy servant doth meditate in Thy statutes. Thou hast done good to Thy servant, O Jehovah, according to Thy word. Deal with Thy servant according to Thy mercy, and teach me Thy statutes. I am Thy servant, cause me to discern, that I may know Thy testimonies. Make Thy faces to shine upon Thy servant, and teach Me Thy statutes. I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek Thy servant (Ps. 119:16, 17, 23, 65, 124, 125, 135, 176). Keep my soul, for I am holy; save Thy servant, for I trust in Thee. Gladden the soul of Thy servant; for unto Thee, O Lord, do I lift up My soul. Give strength unto Thy servant, and save the son of Thy handmaid (Ps. 86:2, 4, 16; and elsewhere, as Ps. 27:9; 31:16; 35:27; 116:16; Luke 1:69). Since the Lord in respect to Divine truth is meant by “David” in the above cited passages, and thus “David,” in like manner as the prophets, means Divine truth, so “servant” in these passages also means in the spiritual sense, what is of service. One who is ignorant of the spiritual sense of the Word might believe that not only David but also others who are spoken of in the Word, called themselves “servants,” for the reason that all are servants of God; but still wherever “servants” are mentioned in the Word, what is of service and effect is meant in the spiritual sense. For this reason too: Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon is called the servant of Jehovah (Jer. 25:9; 43:10). But in a particular sense, “servant” and “servants” in the Word mean those who receive Divine truth and who teach it, since Divine truth is what serves, and by means of it Divine good produces effects. For this reason “servants” and”chosen” are frequently mentioned together, “servants” meaning those who receive Divine truth and who teach, and “chosen” those who receive Divine good and who lead, as in Isaiah:"

[7] Now as “servants” have reference in the Word to what is of service and effects, consequently to such as serve and produce effects, therefore the natural man is called “a servant,” since this serves the spiritual in effecting what it wills; and for this reason the spiritual man is also called “a freeman” and “master.” This, too, is meant by “servant” and “master” in Luke: No servant can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will prefer the one and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon (Luke 16:13). This must be understood as referring, not to servants in the world, for such can serve two masters, and yet not hate and despise one of them, but to servants in a spiritual sense, who are such as desire to love the Lord and themselves equally, or heaven and the world equally. These are like those who wish to look with one eye upwards, and with the other downwards, that is, with one eye to heaven, and with the other to hell, and thus to hang between the two; and yet there must be a predominance of one of these loves over the other; and where there is a predominance, that which opposes will be hated and despised when it offers opposition. For the love of self and of the world is the opposite of love to the Lord and love towards the neighbor. For this reason, those who are in the heavenly love would rather die or he deprived of honors and wealth in the world than be drawn away by them from the Lord"

On the other hand, however, those who love themselves and the world above all things, regard the Lord and heaven as relatively of no account, and even deny them, and so far as they see that they are opposed to self and the world they hate them; this becomes clearly manifest with all such in the other life. With those who love the Lord and heaven cove all things, the internal or spiritual man is open, and the external or natural man serves it; then the latter is a servant because it serves, and the former is a master because it exercises its will; but with those who love themselves and the world above all things, the internal or spiritual man is closed, and the external or natural man is open; and when the latter is open and the former closed, the man loves the one master, namely, himself and the world, and hates the other, namely, the Lord and heaven. To this I am able to bear witness from experience; for all who have lived for self and the world, and not, as they ought, for God and heaven, in the other life hate the Lord and persecute those who are His, however in the world they may have talked about heaven and also about the Lord. From this it can be seen how impossible it is to serve two masters. That these words of the Lord must be understood spiritually is clear from the Lord’s own words; for He says, “Ye cannot serve God and mammon.” [8] In Matthew: The disciple is not above her, nor the servant above his lord. It is enough for the disciple that he be as his teacher, and the servant as his lord (10:24, 26). This in the most general sense means that man must not make himself equal to the Lord, and that it is sufficient for him that all that he has he has from the Lord, and then the disciple is as the Teacher, and the servant as the Lord, for then the Lord is in him, and causes him to will good and to think truth. The term “disciple” is used in reference to good and “servant” in reference to truth. It is similar in a particular sense, namely, with each individual who is led by the Lord, the external or natural man with him is “a"

This particular sense coincides with the most general in this, that when the spiritual and natural man act as one, the Lord Himself acts, for the spiritual man does nothing of itself, but what it does comes solely from the Lord; so far, indeed, as the spiritual man has been opened (for this opens into heaven), so far man acts not of himself but from the Lord; this spiritual man is the spiritual man in its proper sense. [9] In John: Ye shall know the truth; the truth maketh you free. The Jews answered, We are Abraham’s seed, and have never yet been in bondage to any man; how sayest Thou, Ye shall be made free? Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, everyone that committeth sin is a servant of sin. The servant abideth not in the house for ever; the Son abideth for ever. If the Son therefore make you free ye shall be free indeed (8:32–36). This means that to be led by the Lord is freedom, and to be led by hell is slavery; “the truth that makes free” means Divine truth which is from the Lord, for he who receives this in doctrine and in life is free, because he is made spiritual and is led by the Lord; therefore it is also added, “the Son abideth in the house for ever; if the Son make you free ye shall be free indeed,” “Son” meaning the Lord, and also truth (see above, n. 63, 151, 166), and “to abide in the house” meaning to abide in heaven. That to be led by hell is slavery is taught by these words, “everyone that committeth sin is a servant of sin,” “sin” is hell because it is from hell. [10] That to receive Divine truth from the Lord in doctrine and in life is to, be free the Lord teaches also in John: Ye are My friends if ye do whatsoever I command you.

Ye have not chosen Me, but I have chosen you and appointed you that ye may go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit may abide (15:14–16). “Friends” here mean the free, “friends” being contrasted with “servants.” That those who receive the Divine truth in doctrine and life from the Lord are not “servants,” but are “friends” or freemen, is taught by these words, “if ye do whatsoever I command you, no longer do I call you servants, but friends;” likewise by these words, “all things that I have heard from My Father I have made known unto you, that ye may go and bring forth fruit;” “to command” and “to make known” pertain to doctrine, and “to bring forth fruit” pertains to life. That these are from the Lord is thus taught, “ye have not chosen Me, but I have chosen you and appointed you.” Something nearly similar was represented by the Hebrew servants who were sent away free in the seventh year and in the year of Jubilee (who are treated of in Exod. 21:2, 3; Lev. 25:39–41; Deut. 15:12 seq.; Jer. 34:9 seq.). (Concerning these see Arcana Coelestia, n. 8973–9005.) From what has been thus far set forth it can be seen that those are called “servants” in the Word who serve and bring into effect, and that therefore “servant” means the natural man, because this serves its spiritual man by bringing into effect what it wills and thinks; also that those are called “freemen” who act from the love of truth and good, thus who act from the Lord, from whom is the love of truth and good. Moreover, “servants” in the Word mean also those who are led by self and the world, and thence by evils and falsities, consequently who are led by the natural man and not at the same time by the spiritual. But respecting these servants, the Lord willing, it shall be told elsewhere. 410a.

From this it follows that “they hid themselves” signifies that these were lost, the things lost being also in a hidden place. It is evident also from the signification of “caves,” as meaning evils of life (of which presently); and from the signification of “the rocks of the mountains,” as meaning the falsities therefrom; for “rocks” signify the truths of faith, and in the contrary sense the falsities of faith, here the falsities from evils, for “mountains” signify evils springing from the loves of self and of the world (as was shown just above, n. 405g-i). But on the signification of “rocks” see in the article immediately following; here the signification of “caves” will be treated of [2] It was said above that in the spiritual world there are mountains, hills, rocks, valleys, and lands, as on our globe, and that angels and spirits dwell on them; but yet in the spiritual world they have a different appearance; upon the mountains those dwell who are in the greatest light, below these on the same mountain those dwell who are in less light, and beneath these those who are in still less, and in the lowest parts those dwell who are in darkness and thick darkness as compared to the light the higher ones have; accordingly the heavens are in the higher part of the mountains, and the hells are in the lowest parts, thus the expanses of the mountains succeed each other as strata. This is so in order that the lower may be governed by the Lord through the higher; for the Lord flows in immediately from Himself into all things of the spiritual world, and mediately through the higher heavens into the lower, and through these into the hells. The reason for this arrangement is that all may be held in connection by influx; such a coordinate and subordinate arrangement exists through the whole spiritual world. Into the hells, which are under the mountains and in the rocks, entrances lie open either in the lowest parts of their sides or through caverns from the valleys; and the entrances in the lower parts of the sides appear like entrances into caves where there are wild boasts, altogether dark; these are opened when infernal spirits are let in, but are shut when they have been let in. These entrances are called in the Word “the gates of hell.” but among the"

The darkness in these gates or doors appears densely dark to good spirits and angels, but as if luminous to evil spirits; the reason is that there is no light of heaven there, but a fatuous lumen, which is natural lumen apart from the spiritual. The light of those there is not like the light (luminosum) of the world in the daytime, but like the nocturnal light that is suitable for owls, moles, birds of night, and bats, which see nothing in the light of day, and therefore the light of day is thick darkness to them, while the darkness of the night is their light. Their sight is such because it is formed of falsities and evils, which in themselves are darkness and thick darkness; for this reason “darkness” in the Word signifies falsities of every kind, and “thick darkness” the falsities of evil. From this it can be seen what is signified by “they hid themselves in caves,” that is, in evils of life, the goods in them having been destroyed. Evils of life are signified by “caves” for the same reason that “mountains” signify the goods of life, namely, because those who are in them are such; for the spiritual sense is concerned solely with evils or with goods regarded apart from places and persons, that is, with the kinds of evils or goods in the places and in the persons, as has also been several times said above. 410b. [3] From this it can be seen what is signified in the Word by “caves,” “caverns,” “hollows,” “holes,” “clefts,” and “chinks of rocks and mountains,” in the following passages in Isaiah: Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust, for the dread of Jehovah and for the glory of His magnificence. For there shall be a day of Jehovah of Hosts upon everyone that is proud and exalted, and upon everyone that is lifted up, and that is brought low; and upon all the cedars of Lebanon that are exalted and lifted up, and upon all the oaks of Bashan, and upon all the exalted mountains, and upon all Ne hills that are lifted up, and upon every lofty tower, and upon every fenced wall, and upon all the ships of Tarshish, and upon all images of desire; that the haughtiness of man (hominis) may be bowed down, and the loftiness of men (virorum) be brought low, and Jehovah alone he exalted in that day. And the idols shall go away into smoke. And they shall enter into the caves of the rocks, and into the clefts of the dust, for dread of Jehovah and for the glory of His magnificence when He shall arise to terrify the earth.

This is further described by “there shall be a day of Jehovah upon all the cedars that are exalted and lifted up, and upon all the oaks of Bashan, and upon all the exalted mountains and hills that are lifted up, upon every lofty tower and fenced wall, and upon all the ships of Tarshish and the images of desire;” “the cedars of Lebanon” and “the oaks of Bashan” signify the pride of intelligence, “the cedars of Lebanon,” interior pride, and “the oaks of Bashan” exterior pride; “mountains and hills” signify the loves of self and of the world, and the evils and falsities springing from them (as was shown above, n. 405g-i); “tower” and “wall” signify the falsities of doctrine confirmed, “the ships of Tarshish” and “the images of desire” signify the knowledges and perceptions of falsity from evil; their worship from evils and falsities is signified by “the idols which they made for themselves, to bow down to the moles and the bats;” worship from such things as are from self-intelligence is signified by"

That the love of self and such pride are meant is evident from its being said “the presumption of thine heart hath deceived thee; if thou shouldst make thy nest as high as the eagle, thence would I cast thee down.” Those who are in falsities from self- intelligence dwell in rocks below, and the ways of approach to them appear like holes therein. These have also been seen by me. Within, however, there are rooms hollowed out and arched chambers where they sit in their fantasies. But before they are cast into these they are seen on mountains and hills, for they raise themselves into high places by fantasies, and as they are not in truths they think they are there bodily, and yet bodily they are in the caves of the rocks; this, therefore, is what is meant by “dwelling in the holes of the rocks, and holding the height of the hill.” This makes clear the nature of the Word, namely, that in many places it conforms to the aspects and appearances in the spiritual world,"

This, too, is said of Edom, who signifies here the pride of learning which is from self-intelligence, and falsity therefrom destroying the church. As almost similar things are said here as above, so the signification is similar; “the clefts of the rock” signify the falsities of faith and of doctrine, because those dwell there who are in such falsities; these are compared to an eagle because the eagle from its lofty flights signifies the pride of self-intelligence; so, too, “a nest for habitation” is mentioned, and “to set it among the stars” signifies in the heights where those dwell who are in the knowledges of truth, for the knowledges of truth are signified by “stars.” In Job: To dwell in the clefts of the valleys, in the holes of the earth, and in the rocks (30:6).

The falsities that are in this and from it are signified by “the flies in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt;” but “the bee in the land of Assyria” signifies false reasonings therefrom, for “Assyria” signifies the rational, and “Egypt” the knowing faculty of the natural man; and because the rational derives all it has from the knowledges of the natural man, its reasonings are signified by “bees,” for as bees suck out and derive their store from flowers, so the rational does from the knowledges of the natural man. Here, however, “bees” signify false reasonings, because the rational gathers what belongs to it from knowledges falsely applied. It is from correspondences that these are likened to flies and bees; for in the spiritual world flying things of various kinds appear, but they are appearances from the ideas of the thoughts of spirits, and the noxious flying things among them are flies and bees of such a kind; “the flies in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt” have their correspondence from their springing out of the filth of rivers.

This he also did; and afterwards at the end of many days he went there and took it again, and behold the girdle was marred and was not profitable for anything (13:4-7). This represented the quality of the Jewish church, namely, that it was destitute of all the good of life and the truth of doctrine. For “the girdle” upon the loins of the prophet signified the conjunction of the Lord with the church by means of the Word; “Euphrates” signifies everything of the church in respect to good, here in respect to evil; and “the cliff” everything of the church in respect to truth here in respect to falsity, for it is said “a cleft of the cliff;” that “the girdle was marred so as not to be profitable for anything” signified that there was no conjunction whatever of the church with the Lord, consequently that there was no church.

And they said to the mountains and to the rocks, Fall on us, signifies to be covered over by evils and by falsities therefrom. This is evident from the signification of “mountains,” as being the evils that flow from the loves of self and of the world (of which above, n. 405g-i); also from the signification of “rocks,” as being the falsities from evil (of which below); also from the signification of “fall on us,” as being to be covered by them.

The state of the wicked then is such that from the mountains and rocks upon which they have made their habitations they cast themselves down into the hells, more or less deeply according to the atrocity of the evils and falsities with them; and this they themselves do, because they cannot endure Divine good and Divine truth, the higher heavens then being opened, from which the light of heaven flows in, which is Divine truth united to Divine good, by which light their pretended goods and truths are constricted, and these being constricted their evils and falsities are loosened; and as evils and falsities cannot endure the light of heaven, for they are pained and tortured by it, these spirits cast themselves from the mountains and rocks into the hells, more or less deeply according to the quality of their evil and falsity; some into gaps and caves, and some into holes and rocks, which then stand open before them; but as soon as they have cast themselves in, the openings are closed up. In this way the casting out of evil spirits from the mountains and hills which they have occupied is effected (see above, n. 391a, 392a, 394); and when they are in the caves and among the rocks the pains and torments they suffered from the influx of the light of heaven cease; for they find rest in their evils and in the falsities therefrom, because these had been their delights; for the delights of his life remain with everyone after death, and the delights of life are the delights of their loves, for every delight of life is from love. [2] From this the signification of their “calling to the mountains and the rocks to fall on them” can be seen; likewise what is signified in Hosea: They shall say to the mountains, Cover us, and to the hills, Fall on us (10:8).

The light of heaven, which is Divine truth united to Divine good, by the influx and presence of which the evil who cast themselves down are pained and tormented, is meant by the words immediately following in this verse; “hide us from the face of Him that sitteth on the throne, and from the anger of the Lamb;” it is said “the anger O the Lamb” because they are in torment; but their torment is not from that, but from the evils of their loves and from the falsities of their faith; and because these evils and falsities have formed all the interiors of their mind (for each one’s mind is formed by his love and its faith, even so as to be a likeness of these in form), and because the interiors of the mind of those who are in evils and ia falsities therefrom are turned away in a contrary direction, or to a quarter opposite to Divine goods and truths, therefore when Divine truth flows in and endeavors to reverse the action of the interiors of their mind, and thereby to lead them into heaven (for this is what Divine truth proceeding from the Lord does everywhere where it flows in), and they are unwilling to abandon the delights of their loves, they suffer anguish and torment; but these cease when they come into the hells where like delights or like loves prevail. 411b.

This signification of “rocks” is also from appearances in the spiritual world; for rocks and crags are seen there as mountains and hills are seen, as was shown above, and upon the rocks there those dwell who are in truths from spiritual good, and who are in the truth and good of faith. The difference between the mountains and hills, and the rocks and crags is that the former are of soil, and the latter of stone, and “soil” corresponds to and thus signifies the good of love, and “stone” corresponds to and thus signifies the truth of faith. And as most things in the Word have also a contrary sense, so do “rocks,” and in that sense they signify the falsity of faith, and this"

[4] That “rock” signifies truth from good and the truth of faith, and in the highest sense the Lord in respect to these, is evident from the following passages. In Daniel: Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out, not by hands, and it smote the image upon his feet, that were iron and clay. And the stone that smote the image became a great rock and filled the whole earth (2:34, 35). This was said of the image that Nebuchadnezzar saw in his dream. “The stone that became a great rock” means the Lord, as is evident from the particulars there. But first let the signification of what precedes be told; “the head of the image” which was gold, signifies the most ancient church, which was a celestial church, or a church in which the good of love to the Lord reigned; this good is signified in the Word by” gold,” and also by “the head;” “the breast” and “the arms” which were silver, signify the ancient church, which succeeded the Most Ancient, and this church was a spiritual church, or a church in which the good of charity towards the neighbor, and truth from that good, reigned; this truth and good are signified by “silver,” and also by “the breast” and “the arms;” “the belly and the thighs which were brass” signify the church that succeeded the ancient spiritual church and which may be called spiritual-natural; in this church the good of faith and the truth from that good reigned; this good is signified in the Word by “brass,” and also by “the belly” and “the thighs;” but “the legs and the feet, which were part iron and part clay,” signify the Israelitish and Jewish church, which was an external church without any internal, and which therefore had no truth and good, but truth falsified which in itself is falsity, and good adulterated which in itself is evil; therefore it is said respecting it in this chapter: Whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of man; but they shall not cohere one with the other, even as iron doth not mingle with clay (verse 43)."

That Divine truth is here meant by “stone,” and the Lord in respect to Divine truth by “rock,” is evident from the signification of “stone” in the Word when predicated of the Lord (as in Gen. 49:24; Ps. 118:22, 23; Isa. 28:16; Matt. 21:42, 44; Mark 12:10, 11; Luke 20:17, 18).

It is known in the church that this “rock” signified the Lord; but it is not known that it had this signification because “rock” in the Word signifies the Divine truth that proceeds from the Lord; this was why Moses and Aaron were commanded to speak to it, and thus to sanctify Jehovah in the eyes of the sons of Israel. Also “the waters” that Sowed forth signify Divine truth; and “the people drinking of them” signifies to nourish spiritually, which is done by instructing and teaching. (That “waters” signify truths, see above, n. 71; and that “to drink,” and “to be given to drink,” signify to be instructed and to be taught, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 3069, 3772,4017,4018, 8562, 9412 ) The like is signified by “rock” in Isaiah: They shall not thirst; He will lead them in desolate places; He will cause the waters to flow out of the rock for them, when He cleaveth the rock that the waters may issue (48:21). In David: He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and made them to drink of the great depths; and He brought streams out of the cliff; and they remembered that God was their Rock, and the most high God their Redeemer (Ps. 78:15, 16, 20, 35). He opened the rock that the waters might issue out; they flowed in the dry places, a river (Ps. 105:41). Before the Lord thou art in travail, O earth, before the God of Jacob, who turned the rock into a pool of waters, the flint into a fountain of waters (Ps. 114:7, 8). That “rock” in these passages signifies the Lord in respect to Divine truth, or what is the same, Divine truth from the Lord, is evident from what has been said above, also from the fact that these two passages in David treat of the redemption and the regeneration of the men of the church, and this is effected by means of Divine truth from the Lord. Redemption is treated of in these words, “they"

[6] In Isaiah: Hearken unto me, ye that follow after righteousness, ye that seek Jehovah; look unto the rock out of which ye were hewn, and to the digging out of the pit out of which ye were digged (51:1). The “rock” means the Lord in respect to Divine truth, and the “pit” signifies the Word, as also in other places; “to be hewn out of the rock” and “to be digged out of the pit,” signify to be regenerated by Divine truths and Divine goods, thus by truths from good from the Lord; for “stones,” that are cut out of a rock, signify truths from the Lord; and “soil,” that is dug out of a pit, signifies good from the Lord, therefore it is called “the digging out of the pit.” [7] In Moses: Give ye greatness unto our God; the rock, whose work is perfect, and all His ways are judgment. He made him to ride on the high places of the earth, and feedeth him with the increase of the fields; He maketh him to suck honey out of the cliff, and oil out of the flint of the rock.

This is said of the ancient church, which was a church that was in truths from good; therefore truths from good are described by various things that correspond, as “He made him to ride on the high places of the earth, Re fed him with the increase of the fields; He made him to suck honey out of the cliff, and oil out of the flint of the rock.” Intelligence in the spiritual things of this church is signified by “He made him to ride on the high places of the earth;” “to ride” signifying to understand; “the high places of the earth”"

The Jewish church, which was not in any Divine truth, is next treated of, and respecting this it is said, “the rock that begat thee hast thou given to forgetfulness, and hast forgotten God thy Former,” which signifies that the Lord, and thence Divine truth, by which the church is reformed, were rejected; “rock” meaning the Lord in respect to Divine truth, and “that begat thee,” and “God the Former” signifying to be reformed by the Lord by means of Divine truth. That they were altogether deprived of truth and good is signified by “their rock hath sold them, and Jehovah hath shut them up,” “rock” having reference to truth, and “Jehovah” to good; “to sell” and “to shut up” means to be deprived of. That they would be in falsity from evil is signified by “their rock is not as our rock neither are our enemies judges” “their rock” meaning falsity, “our enemies” evils, “not judges” signifying not truths and goods. From this it can he seen that “rock” signifies the Lord in respect to Divine truth, and in the contrary sense, falsity.

I would feed them with the fat of wheat; and with honey out of the rock I would satisfy them (Ps. 81:13, 16).

He shall call Me, Thou art my Father, my God, the Rock of my salvation. I also will make Him the firstborn, high above the kings of the earth (Ps. 89:26, 27).

As in the Gospels: Everyone that heareth My words and doeth them, I will liken him to a prudent man, who built his house upon a rock; and the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house, yet it fell not, for it was founded upon a rock (Matt. 7:24, 25; Luke 6:48). “The house founded upon a rock” means the church and the man of the church who has founded his doctrine and life upon the Divine truth, which is from the Lord, thus upon those things that are in the Word, consequently one who is in truths from good from the Lord. It is said, “who is in truths from good,” because Divine truth is not received by anyone who is not in good. To be in good is to be in the good of life, which is charity, therefore it is said “he that heareth My words and doeth them;” “doing the Lord’s words” is the good of life, for truth, when a man does it, becomes good because it then enters the will and love, and whatever becomes of the will and love is called good.

This, to be sure, is a comparison, but it should be known that all comparisons in the Word are as much according to correspondences as are the things not said comparatively (see above, n. 69; and Arcana Coelestia, n. 3579, 8989). 411d. This makes plainly evident that “rock” in the Word signifies the Lord in respect to Divine truth, or Divine truth from the Lord. [12] From this it can be seen what is signified by the Lord’s words to Peter, in Matthew: Jesus said to the disciples, But who say ye that I am. Simon Peter answered, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God. Jesus answering said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon son of Jonah; for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but My Father who is in the heavens. I say unto thee, Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of the heavens, that whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in the heavens, and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in the heavens (16:15–19). “Peter” here does not mean Peter, but Divine truth from the Lord (as in the passages cited above) for all the Lord’s disciples together represented the church; and each one of them some constituent of the church; “Peter” the truth of the church, “James” its good, and “John” good in act, that is, works; the rest of the disciples represented the truths and goods that are derived from these, just as the twelve tribes of Israel. That this is so will be seen in what follows, where the tribes and the disciples are treated of. This is why these three disciples are mentioned in the Word more than the others.

By virtue of this confession “Peter” represented Divine truth from the Lord in the church, and for this reason he was called “a rock” (petra), and it is said “thou art a rock, upon this rock I will build My church,” which signifies upon Divine truth from the Lord, or what is the same, upon truths from good, for upon these the church is built. That Peter might represent this in the church he was called by the Lord “a rock” as is evident in John: Jesus looking upon him said unto him, Thou art Simon, the son of Jonah; thou shalt be called Cephas, which is, by interpretation, a rock (1:42). Cephas in the Syriac language means a rock, and so Peter in that version is everywhere called “Cephas;” moreover, the same word in the Hebrew means a rock (as is evident in Jer. 4:29; and Job 30:6, where “rocks” are mentioned in the plural number); but Peter is not called a rock in the Greek and Latin because the name was bestowed upon him as a personal name. [14] The Lord said “Simon son of Jonah” and afterwards he was called “a rock,” because “Simon son of Jonah” signifies truth from good, or faith from charity; and as truth from good or faith from charity is granted only to those who are in Divine truth from the Lord, and Peter then confessed [the Lord], so he is called “a rock,” not himself as a person, but that Divine truth which was from the Lord with him in his confession. That this was from the Lord is meant by the Lord’s words, “flesh and blood has not revealed it unto thee, but My Father who is in the heavens;” “the Father in the heavens” meaning the Divine in the Lord, since the Father was in Him, and He in the Father and they were one (John 14:7–11; 10:30, 38). That “Simon” signifies truth in the will, see in the following chapter; and that “dove,” which is what “Jonah” means, signifies spiritual good, see Arcana Coelestia (n. 870, 1826, 1827); consequently “Simon son of Jonah” signifies the truth of good or truth from good.

How these words are to be understood see above (n. 405i), namely, that to ask from the faith of charity is to ask not from self but from the Lord, for whatever anyone asks not from self but from the Lord he receives. That such is the signification of these words, “whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in the heavens, and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in the heavens,” is clear from the Lord’s words to the disciples and to all who are in truths from good from the Lord, in Matthew: Verily I say unto you, What things soever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and what things soever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in the heavens (18:18).

For where two or three are gathered in My name, there am I in the midst of them (18:19, 20). “The Lord’s name means everything by which He is worshiped; and as He is worshiped by means of truth from good, which is from Him, so this is meant by “His name.” (That this is what is meant by the “Lord’s name,” see above, n. 102, 135.)

That “Peter” signifies truth from good, which is from the Lord, see in the small work on the Last Judgment, n. 57.) 411e. [17] Thus far it has been shown what “rock” signifies in this sense; it shall now be shown what “rock” signifies in the contrary sense. In the contrary sense “rock” signifies infernal falsity that is trusted in; as in the following passages. In Isaiah: Hewing out thy sepulcher in the height, graving for himself a habitation in the cliff (22:16). This chapter treats of “the valley of vision,” which signifies the falsity of doctrine confirmed by the sense of the letter of the Word; the love of falsity is signified by “the sepulcher in the height,” and the belief of falsity by “the habitation in the cliff;” their making such things for themselves is signified by “hewing out” and “graving for themselves.” [18] In the same:"

This treats of judgment upon those who from self-intelligence believe themselves to be wise in Divine things. Such are those who are in the love of self and the world, and who seek after a reputation for learning for the sake of self; these, because they are unable to see truths, seize on falsities and proclaim them as truths. The falsities that favor their principles and their loves are signified by “the idols of silver and the idols of gold;” that these are from self-intelligence is signified by “which your hands have made for you;” that they will perish by their own falsities is signified by “then shall Asshur fall by the sword not of a man (vir), and the sword not of a man (homo) shall devour him;” “Asshur” meaning the rational perverted, and thence those who are in falsities from self-intelligence; “to fall and to be devoured by the sword” meaning to perish This was represented also by the king of Assyria in that he was slain by his own sons (Isa. 37:38); “his sons” there signifying his own falsities by which he perished; “his cliff, which shall pass away for awe,” signifies all falsity in general, in which such have trusted; and “the princes, who shall be dismayed at the banner,” signify the primary falsities; it is said “at the banner,” because such falsities are dispersed not by any combat with truths, but by a mere sign of combat, which a banner is.

[20] I have also seen rocks that consisted of stones heaped together, with no level place where verdure grew as elsewhere upon rocks; upon these were spirits who while they lived in the world as men had been in faith separate from charity, which is called faith alone, and had confirmed themselves therein both in doctrine and in life. This is what is meant by “the dryness of the rock,” in Ezekiel: She set it upon the dryness of the cliff; she poured it not upon the earth that dust might cover it (24:7). I will cause many nations to come up against thee; and they shall destroy the walls of Tyre and throw down her towers; and I will purge her dust from her, and make her the dryness of a cliff (26:3, 4, 14). “Dust” in these two passages means the soil, which signifies the good of the church. When there is no soil on the rocks, but the rocks are dry, that is, consist of mere heaps of stones, as was said above, it is a sign that there is no good, and where there is no good there is mere falsity; so this is what is signified by “the dryness of a cliff,” and “she poured it not upon the earth, that the dust might cover it,” and “I will purge her dust from her.” This makes evident what is signified by the Lord’s words in the Gospels: Other seed fell upon the rocky places, where they had not much soil; and straightway they sprang up because they had no depth of earth; and they dried up (Matt. 13:5, 6; Luke 8:6).

The Word is said to be “like a fire and like a hammer” because “fire” signifies the good of love, and “hammer” the truth of faith, for “the hammer” has a similar signification as “iron,” and “iron” signifies truth in ultimates, and the truth of faith. Both are mentioned, namely, “fire” and “hammer,” and accordingly good and truth, because of the marriage of good and truth in every particular of the Word. “The cliff that is scattered” signifies the falsity in the whole complex and the doctrine of falsity; and these are scattered or destroyed, when man with whom they exist, is judged.

In that sense “to heat oneself with gods under every green tree” signifies to worship God from every falsity that occurs; “to heat oneself with gods” means ardent worship, and “every green tree” means every falsity that occurs, for “tree” signifies knowledges and perceptions, here the knowledges and perceptions of falsity; and “to slaughter the children in the brooks, under the shelves of the cliffs” signifies to extinguish truths by falsities from self-intelligence; “children” meaning truths, “brooks” self-intelligence, “shelves of the cliffs” falsities; “under the shelves of these” signifies from the sensual, in which there is the ultimate natural light, for those who are in that light only stand under precipitous rocks and do not see any truth, and if it is told them they do not perceive it In such a position I also have seen them in the spiritual world.

He who abides in the mere sense of the letter of the Word and does not think beyond it, can easily be led to believe that he is called “happy” who does this with the babes of his enemies, when yet that would be an enormous crime; but he is called “happy” who disperses the falsities of evil springing up in the church, which are here signified by “the babes of Babylon.” [28] In Jeremiah: Who hath heard such a thing as this? the virgin of Israel hath done a horrible thing.

In David: Make Thy faces to shine upon Thy servant; save me because of Thy mercy (31:16). “To make the faces to shine” signifies to enlighten in Divine truth from Divine love; this is signified by “making the faces to shine,” because Divine truth, which proceeds from the Lord as a sun in the angelic heaven, gives all the light there, and also enlightens the minds of the angels and fills them with wisdom; consequently the Lord’s face, in a proper sense, is the sun of the angelic heaven; for the Lord appears to the angels of the interior heavens as a sun, and this from His Divine love, for love in the heavens when presented before the eyes appears as fire, but the Divine love as a sun. From that sun both heat and light proceed, that heat is Divine good, and that light is Divine truth. From this it can be seen that “Make Thy faces to shine upon Thy servant” signifies to enlighten with Divine truth from Divine good; therefore it is also added, “save me because of Thy mercy;” mercy is of the Divine good.

Both are necessary to make man wise, for everyone that is in the spiritual world is enlightened by the light that is from the Lord as a sun, and yet those only become intelligent and wise who are at the same time in love, because the good that is of love is what receives truth; for they are conjoined because they agree and love one another.

But these same words in the purely spiritual sense signify that the Lord in respect to His Divine good is in the good of innocence, for this is signified by “infant child” in the spiritual sense, and “the face of the Father” signifies the Lord’s Divine good.

This treats of the Lord, who is called “the angel of the faces” of Jehovah from Divine truth which is from His Divine love; for “angel” in the Word signifies Divine truth, this is why the angels are called”gods” (see above, n. 130, 200, 302); and “the faces of Jehovah” mean the Divine love which is in the Lord, therefore it is also said, “because of His love and His pity He redeemed them; and He carried them and lifted them up all the days of eternity;” all this is of the Divine love. The Lord in respect to His Human was Divine truth, and from this He combated with the hells, and by it subjugated them; for this reason He is called “an angel,” that is, in respect to His Divine Human.

Because this light is Divine truth itself, from which is all intelligence and wisdom, whatever comes into this light has its quality exhibited as in clear day; for this reason when the evil come into this light they appear just as they are, deformed and monstrous according to the evils concealed with them. This makes clear what is meant by “Thou hast set our iniquities before Thee, and our hidden things in the light of Thy faces.” [10] In Jeremiah: Proclaim these words towards the north, and say, Return, thou backsliding Israel; I will not cause My faces to fall upon you, for I am merciful (3:12). Here, too, “My faces” signify the Divine love, and every good that is of love; and “not causing the faces to fall” signifies not to let it be lowered or cease, for when the countenance falls then it ceases to look, which makes clear what is signified by “I will not cause My faces to fall upon you,” so it is also said, “for I am merciful,” mercy being the Divine love towards the miserable. “Proclaim towards the north” signifies towards those who are in falsities and in evils therefrom; so it is also said, “Return, thou backsliding Israel.” “The north” signifies such, because those who are in falsities and in evils therefrom dwell in the northern quarter in the spiritual world. (Of falsities and the evils therefrom, see in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, n. 21.)

The interiors of the church, of the Word, and of worship are signified by “seeing,” “seeking,” and “entreating the faces of Jehovah.” In Isaiah: What is the multitude of your sacrifices unto Me? when ye shall come to see the faces of Jehovah (1:11, 12). In Zechariah: The inhabitants of one city shall go to another, saying, In going let us go to entreat the faces of Jehovah, and to seek Jehovah of Hosts; thus many peoples and numerous nations shall come to seek Jehovah of Hosts in Jerusalem, and to entreat the faces of Jehovah (8:21, 22).

Hope thou in God, for I shall yet confess to Him; His faces are salvations (42:2, 5). In these passages, “faces of Jehovah,” “of God,” or “of the Lord,” mean the interiors of the church, of the Word, and of worship, because Divine good and Divine truth, thus the Lord Himself, are in these interiors, and from them in externals; but are not in externals, namely, of the church, of the Word, and of worship apart from these. [12] As it was the duty of all who went to Jerusalem to the feasts to carry with them such things as pertained to worship, and all worship is from the interiors which are of the heart and faith, and these interiors are signified by the gifts offered to the Lord, so it was commanded that everyone should offer some gift, which is meant by: They shall not see My faces empty (Exod. 23:15). The interiors of the church, of the Word, and of worship, are also signified by these words in Moses: Jehovah spoke unto Moses, My faces shall go until I shall give thee rest. Then Moses said, If Thy faces go not make us not go up hence (Exod. 33:14, 15). This was said to Moses, because with that nation the Word was to be written, and also in the historical parts of the Word that nation was to be treated of, for with that nation a church was to be instituted which would be a representative church consisting of external things that corresponded to things internal; on this account it was said, “My faces shall go.” (Respecting this see further in Arcana Coelestia, n. 10567, 10568, where it is explained.) [13] But because that nation was only in the externals of the Word, of the church, and of worship, and not at all in the internals, therefore it was not granted to Moses to see the Lord’s face, but only His back, according to these words in Moses:"

I will put thee in a hole of the rock, and will cover thee with My hand until I shall have passed by; and when I shall take away My hand thou shalt see My hinder parts, but My faces shall not be seen (Exod. 33:18–23). Here Moses represented that nation, what was its quality in respect to the understanding of the Word, and thence in respect to the church and worship, namely, that it was in externals only without internals. These externals were represented and signified by “the hinder parts” of Jehovah which were seen by Moses, and the internals by the front parts and “the face.” That the internals that are in the externals of the Word, of the church, and of worship, were not seen and could not be seen by that nation, was represented and signified by Moses being placed in the hole of a rock, and by his being covered with the hand of Jehovah while He passed by. (But this has been more fully explained in Arcana Coelestia, n. 10573–10584.) 412d. [14] Furthermore, since “the faces of Jehovah” or the Lord mean the internals of the Word, of the church, and of worship, they mean especially the externals in which are internals; since internals make themselves to be seen in externals, as the internals of man do in his face and features. But the Jewish nation was such that it looked to externals only, and to internals not at all; and to look at externals and not at the same time at internals, or at externals without internals, is like looking at the image of a man that is without life; but to look at externals and at the same time at internals, or at externals from internals, is like looking at a living man; this therefore is, in the proper sense, “to see the face of Jehovah,” or “to entreat His faces,” in the passages cited above. [15] Since the internals of the Word, of the church, and of worship, appear in the externals, or present themselves to be seen in externals, comparatively as the internals of man do in the face, it is evident what is signified in the internal sense by “seeing Jehovah” or the Lord “face to face,” in the following passages.

[16] But it should be known that no man, nor even any angel, can see the Lord’s face, since it is Divine love, and no one can sustain the Divine love such as it is in itself; for to see the Lord’s face would be like letting the eye into the very fire of the sun, whence it would instantly perish. Such also is the Lord’s Divine love viewed in itself; therefore to those in the interior heavens the Lord appears as a sun, and that sun is encompassed by many radiant circles, which are envelopments one after another, in order that the Divine love may proceed to the angels in heaven tempered and moderated, and thus the angels may sustain it; the Lord therefore appears as a sun to the angels of the higher heavens only,"

Thus the Lord was seen by Gideon, and by Manoah and his wife, also by Moses, and the Israelitish people. This, therefore, is what is meant by “seeing Jehovah face to face,” and by “seeing Jehovah and not dying.” It is clearly evident that the face itself in respect to the interiors which are of His Divine love was not seen, for it was said to Moses: That no one can see Jehovah’s face and live (Exod. 33:20). Yet it is said that “they saw Jehovah face to face;” which shows clearly that “seeing the faces of Jehovah” in the passages cited above signifies seeing Him in the interiors of the Word, of the church, and of worship, which nevertheless is seeing Him in externals from internals. That the Jewish nation was in the externals of the Word, of the church, and of worship, apart from internals, may be seen in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem (n. 248; what the external is apart from the internal, and what the external is in which is the internal, see n. 47). [17] That the Jewish nation was such, was also represented and signified by: Their covering the Lord’s face, striking it, and spitting in it (Matt. 26:67; Mark 14:65; Luke 22:64); for all things related in the Word respecting the Lord’s passion represent and signify arcana of heaven and the church, and in particular the quality of the Jews in respect to the Word, the church, and worship.

Reception must be from freedom, in order that goods and truths may abide with man, and be with him as his own; for what a man does from freedom he does from affection, for all freedom is of affection, and affection is man’s will; therefore what is received in freedom, or from man’s affection, enters his will and endures. It then endures because the will is the man himself and in the will his life primarily resides, but secondarily in the thought or the understanding. This therefore is why man ought to receive Divine good and Divine truth, with which the Lord is always present.

And in Isaiah: Your sins have hid God’s faces from you (59:2). [21] That the evil turn away their face from the Lord does not mean that they do it with the face of the body, but with the face of their spirit. Man can turn his face whatever way be pleases, since he is in a state of freedom to turn himself either towards heaven or towards hell, and moreover a man’s face is taught to deceive for the sake of the appearance before the world; but when man becomes a spirit, which he does immediately after death, then he who had lived in evils turns the face altogether away from the Lord (as can be seen from what has been said and shown in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 17, 123, 142, 144, 145, 151, 153, 251, 272, 511, 552, 561).

This was said of the four horns of the he-goat, by which are there meant four kingdoms, but “kingdoms” there do not mean kingdoms but the states of the church, for “a he-goat of the goats” means faith separated from charity, which is called with alone; “the latter end of their kingdom” signifies the end of the church, when there is no faith because there is no charity; “when the transgressors are come to the full” signifies when there are no longer truth and good, but evil and falsity; these words signify the like as “when iniquity is consummated and fulfilled” (respecting which see above, n. 397). “A king hard in faces” signifies no truth but only falsity in their interiors; “king” signifying truth, and in the contrary sense falsity; “faces” the interiors, and “hard in faces” the interiors without good; for where there is no good, truth is hard, while truth from good is mild, because living; and truth without good even becomes falsity in their interiors or thought, since they do not think about it spiritually but materially, because they think from things corporeal and worldly, and thus from the fallacies of the senses.

[33] In Isaiah: Their tongue and their doings are against Jehovah, to rebel against the eyes of His glory; the harness of their faces answereth against them (3:8, 9). “Their tongue and their doings which are against Jehovah” signify thought and affection; “the tongue” thought, because the tongue utters what man thinks, and “doings” affection, because man does what is of his affection; these “are against Jehovah, and rebel against the eyes of His glory” when they are against Divine good and against Divine truth; for “Jehovah” in the Word means the Lord in respect to Divine good proceeding from His Divine love, and “His glory” means Divine truth; to he against this is signified by “rebelling against the eyes of His glory;” “the hardness of their faces which answers against them” signifies to refuse Divine truth and Divine good, and not to admit them into their thoughts and affections, which are their interiors.

The affection of truth and good is hardened and becomes outwardly hard from zeal, when it is combating against falsity and evil, otherwise it could not repulse them; but it is not so inwardly. From this it can be seen how these words must be understood. Since “faces” signify man’s interiors, or the things that are of his thought and affection, the same word in the Hebrew that means “face” means what is interior. 412g. [35] (In these explanations various things have been said respecting “faces” which cannot be easily understood, perhaps, without further exposition; I will therefore add what has been said and shown respecting faces in the Arcana Coelestia, namely, that the face is formed to a correspondence with man’s interiors, n. 4791–4805 5695; on the correspondence of the face and countenance with the affections of the mind, n. 1568, 2988, 2989, 3631, 4796, 4797, 4800, 5165, 5168, 9306; consequently the interiors shine forth from the face, n. 3527, 4066, 4796; with the ancients the face made one with the interiors, n. 3573, 4326, 5695; it also makes one with the interiors with the angels in heaven, and with sincere men in the world, n. 4796, 4797, 4799, 5695, 8250; in the other life the faces of all become such as their interiors are, n. 4798, 5695; experiences respecting changes of the face there according to the interiors, n. 4796, 6604; on the influx of the interiors of the mind, or of the understanding and will into the face and its muscles, n. 3631, 4800; with flatterers, dissemblers, hypocrites, and the deceitful, the face does not act as one with the interiors, n. 4799, 8250; with such the face is taught to feign sincerity, honesty, and piety, n. 4326; how influx from the brains into the face became changed in process of time, and with it the face itself in respect to its correspondence with the interiors, n. 4326, 8250; the natural of man is like an interior face to the spiritual mind and its sight n. 5165, 5168.

      "text": "APOCALYPSE EXPLAINED 1298 413a. Verse 17. For the great day of His anger is come, signifies the last judgment upon the evil. This is evident from the following passages from the Word. The last judgment, which is signified by “the great day,” is upon the evil and also upon the good; the judgment upon the evil is called “a day of indignation,” “of wrath,” “of anger,” and “of vengeance,” while the judgment upon the good is called “the time of the Lord’s coming,” “the year of His good pleasure,” “the year of the redeemed,” “the year of salvation.” Everyone, whether evil or good, is judged immediately after death, when he enters the spiritual world, where he is to live to eternity, for man is then immediately marked out either for heaven or for hell; he that is marked out for heaven is connected with some heavenly society into which he will afterwards come, and he that is marked out for hell is connected with the infernal society into which he will afterwards come. There is, however, an interval of time before they go thither, chiefly for the purpose of preparation; for the good, that the evils that adhere to them from the body in the world may be wiped away; and for the evil, that the goods that adhere to them outwardly from teachers and from religion may be taken away; according to the Lord’s words in Matthew: Whosoever hath, to him shall be given, that be may have more abundantly; whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that be hath (13:32; 25:29). This delay occurs for this reason also, that the affections, which are of many kinds, may be so arranged and reduced to the ruling love that the man-spirit may become wholly his own love. Yet many of them, both evil and good, were reserved for the last judgment; but only such of the evil as from habit acquired in the world had been able to lead a moral life in externals, and such of the good as from ignorance and from their religion had been imbued with falsities; but the rest, when their time had been fulfilled, were separated from these, the good were elevated into heaven, and the evil were cast into hell, and this before the last judgment. [2] The last judgment is called “the great day of the anger of God” because to the evil who are cast down into hell it appears as if it were God who did this from anger and wrath, for the destruction"

But the Lord has no anger what ever, for He is love and mercy itself and good itself; and pure love and good itself cannot be angry; for this is contrary to its essence. But it so appears for this reason: when the last state is reached, which is when evils on the earth and at the same time then in the spiritual world have so increased that the supremacy inclines to their side, and thereby the equilibrium between heaven and hell is perishing, and this perishing, the heavens where the angels dwell begin to labor, then the Lord from the sun directs His energy, that is His love, to protecting the angels and restoring the state which labors and begins to totter; and by this energy and power Divine truth united to Divine good, which in its essence is Divine love, penetrates through the heavens to the places below, where the evil have associated themselves together; and because they cannot endure such influx and presence of the Divine love they begin to tremble, and to be in anguish and torment; for thereby the goods and truths which they have learned to feign by speech and action merely in externals, are dispersed, and their internals, which are nothing but evils and falsities, are opened; and as these are in direct opposition to the goods and truths that flow in from within, although they have made evils and falsities their life, they experience such tremor, anguish and torment, that they can no longer maintain themselves, therefore they flee away and cast themselves into the hells which are under the mountains and rocks, where they can be in evils and in the falsities of their evils. This in particular is signified by the words explained above, “They said to the mountains and to the rocks, Fall on us and hide us from the face of Him that sitteth on the throne, and from the anger of the Lamb.” [3] From this it can be seen why the words “the anger of the Lab” are used, and why the last judgment is called “the great day of His anger,” although it is the Divine love that is meant, the operation of which viewed in itself is to save all, for it is a will to save, thus not anger at all, but love.

It is from this appearance, and because when they do evils they are punished, that indignation, anger, wrath, and even fury and vengeance, are so often in the Word attributed to Jehovah, that is, the Lord; but a presentation of all the passages where these are attributed to Jehovah, that is, to the Lord, is here omitted because there are so many of them, and a few only will be cited, in which the last judgment is called “the day of the indignation,” “of the anger,” “of the wrath,” and “of the vengeance” of Jehovah and God, as in the following. [4] In Isaiah: Behold the day of Jehovah cometh, cruel and of indignation and of the glowing of anger, to lay the land waste, and He shall destroy its sinners out of it. I will make heaven to tremble, the land shall quake out of its place, in the indignation of Jehovah of Hosts, and in the day of the glowing of His anger (13:9, 13). “A day cruel and of the glowing of Jehovah’s anger” means the last judgment; and because it is evil that glows, and falsity that is angry, it is called “a day of the glowing of anger.” “The land that shall be laid waste, and that shall quake out of its place,” means the land that is in the spiritual world, for there are lands there the same as on our globe; and those lands, while the last judgment is going on, are “laid waste” and “quake out of their place,” for the mountains and hills are then overturned, and the valleys sink down into marshes, and the face of all things there is changed. Nevertheless, “land” in the spiritual sense means the church everywhere, for in the spiritual world the face of the land is similar to the state of the church with those who dwell upon the land there, consequently when the church perishes the land also perishes, for they make one; and then in place of the former land a new one comes into existence; but these changes are unknown to us on our earth.

Here, too, “the glowing of anger” and “the day of Jehovah’s anger” mean the last judgment. In Lamentations: He doth not remember the footstool of His feet in the day of His anger (2:1). “The footstool of Jehovah’s feet” means the worship of the Lord in the natural world, for the reason that the whole heaven, together with the church in the world, is before the Lord a semblance of one Man (as may be seen in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 78–86), the inmost heaven constituting the head, the other heavens the breast and legs, and the church on earth the feet; consequently the feet signify also the natural; moreover, the heavens rest upon the church which is with mankind as a man does upon his feet (as can be seen from what is shown in the same work, n. 87–102, also 291–302). Since the last judgment comes when there is no longer any faith because there is no charity, thus when the church is at an end, it is evident what is meant by “He doth not remember the footstool of His feet in the day of His anger.” And elsewhere: There was none that escaped nor any residue in the day of Jehovah’s anger; those whom I brought up and nourished hath mine enemy consumed (Lam. 2:22). “The day of Jehovah’s anger” is the last judgment; that there is then no longer any good of love nor any truth of faith in the church, but evil and falsity, is signified by “there was none that escaped nor any residue those whom I brought up and nourished hath mine enemy consumed;” “there was none that escaped nor any residue” signifying that there was no good nor truth; “whom I brought up"

[6] In Revelation: Thine anger came, the time of judging the dead, and of giving the reward to Thy servants, and to those that fear Thy name, and of destroying them that destroy the earth (11:18). This makes clear that “anger” or “the day of anger” means the last judgment, for it is said “Thine anger came, the time of judging the dead.” In Isaiah: The day of vengeance is in My heart, and the year of My redeemed hath come. I have trodden down the peoples in Mine anger, and made them drunk in My wrath (63:4, 6). This treats of the combats of the Lord, by which He subjugated the hells, thus of a last judgment which was accomplished by Him when He was in the world; for by combats, which were temptations admitted into Himself, He subjugated the hells and wrought a last judgment. It is this judgment that is meant by “the day of Jehovah’s anger and wrath” in the Word of the Old Testament; but the last judgment, which has at the present time been accomplished, is meant by “the day of His anger” in Revelation. (That a last judgment was performed by the Lord when He was in the world, see in the work on the Last Judgment, n. 46.) The subjugation of the hells is here signified by “I have trodden them down in Mine anger, and have made them drunk in My wrath;” “the year of the redeemed” signifies the judgment upon the good who are saved. [7] In the same: The spirit of the Lord Jehovih, is upon me, to proclaim the year of Jehovah’s good pleasure, and the day of vengeance for our God; to comfort all that mourn (61:1, 2)."

In other places also, the time of the last judgment is called “the day of Jehovah,” “the day of visitation,” “the day of slaughter,” and “the day of the coming”: The day of the Lord’s coming (Matt. 3:2; Matt. 24:3, 27, 37, 39). 414. And who is able to stand? signifies, who shall sustain and live? This is evident from the signification of standing, when it is before the Lord, as meaning to sustain and live, here, not able to sustain it and live; for, as was said above, the evil, from the influx and consequent presence of the Lord, that is, of Divine good and Divine truth going out and proceeding from Him with power and might, come not only into the tremors from fear, but also into torments from interior conflict, consequently unless they flee away and cast themselves down they cannot live, for from fear and torment death as it were befalls them, for the presence of the Divine brings death to the evil as it brings life to the good. From this their state it is then said, “Who is able to stand?” As also in Malachi: Who sustaineth the day of His coming, and who shall stand when He shall appear? (3:2)."

As in Luke: The angel answered Zachariah, I am Gabriel, that standeth before God (i. 19). Be wakeful at every season, that ye may be accounted worthy to stand before the Son of man (21:36). And elsewhere. And as “to stand” also signifies to be, it is said of Jehovah, in Isaiah: Jehovah hath stood up to plead, and standeth to judge (3:13).
