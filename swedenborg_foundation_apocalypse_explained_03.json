      "text": "APOCALYPSE EXPLAINED 1310 Editor’s Preface This edition of Apocalypse Explained was translated by John C. Ager and revised by John Whitehead. The text was electronically scanned from the Swedenborg Foundation’s Standard Edition of 1911–1912. This process allowed the books to be completely reset in a more readable typeface. It also allowed for updating certain stylistic elements and for substituting contemporary spellings. Arabic numbers have replaced the Roman numerals, and some of the longer passages have been divided into paragraphs for greater ease of reading. The Ager/Whitehead translation, however, has not been materially altered. Volume 3 of Apocalypse Explained continues Swedenborg’s verse- by-verse exposition, or commentary, of the biblical text of the Apocalypse, commonly known as Revelation or the Revelation of John. This volume covers chapters 7 through 10. As was the custom in his day, Swedenborg referred to the Psalms as the book of David, and to the Pentateuch (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy) as the books of Moses. As with previous printings, the bold numerals in brackets, [2], [3], etc., indicate divisions of Swedenborg’s longer numbered sections that were added for the convenience of the reader by J. F. Potts in his six-volume Swedenborg Concordance (London: Swedenborg Society, 1888–1902). The numbers in parentheses (6), (7), etc., are divisions of the exposition by the author. Italicized letters following a number (518a, 518b) are subdivisions added by the Latin editor, S. H. Worcester. The critical notes were originally compiled by Worcester when he edited the Latin text for a Latin-English edition of Apocalypse Explained published by the Swedenborg Foundation between 1889 and 1897. These notes were used sparingly by Whitehead in this English edition, principally in cases where some difference in meaning is involved. All the notes, referenced by superscripts in the text, will be found at the end of the volume. William Ross Woofenden Sharon, Massachusetts"

And I saw another angel ascending from the rising of the sun, having the seal of the living God; and he cried with a great voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea; 3. Saying, Hurt not the earth, nor the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God on their foreheads. 4. And I heard the number of those sealed; a hundred and forty-four thousand sealed out of every tribe [of the sons]1 of Israel. 5.

And all the angels stood around the throne and the elders and the four animals, and they fell before the throne upon their faces, and worshiped God. 12. Saying, Amen: the blessing and the glory and the wisdom and the thanksgiving and the honor and the power and the strength unto our God unto the ages of the ages; amen. 13.

And he said unto me, These are they who come out of the great tribulation, and have washed their robes and have made their robes white in the blood of the Lamb. 15. Therefore are they before the throne of God, and they serve Him day and night in His temple; and He that sitteth on the throne shall dwell over them. 16. They shall hunger no more, neither thirst anymore; neither shall the sun fall on them, nor any heat. 17. For the Lamb who is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall guide them unto living fountains of waters; and God shall wipe away every tear from their eyes. EXPOSITION 415. Verse 1. And after these things I saw four angels standing upon the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow upon the earth, nor upon the sea, nor upon any tree. 1. “And after these things I saw,” signifies a new perception as to the state of heaven before the last judgment (n. 416); “four angels standing upon the four corners of the earth,” signifies the Divine proceeding from the Lord in the whole spiritual world (n. 417); “holding the four winds of the earth,” signifies moderation of its influx (n. 418); “that the wind should not blow,” signifies that the good be not injured, and the evil be not cast out before the day (n. 419); “upon the earth nor upon the sea nor upon any tree,” signifies everywhere in the spiritual world, even to its ultimates, with those who have some perception (n. 420). 416. Verse 1. And after these things I saw, signifies a new perception as to the state of heaven before the last judgment. This is evident from what follows in this chapter, which treats of the separation of the good from the evil; for before the last judgment occurs the good are separated from the evil by the Lord, and are led away; and because this is involved in the things that were seen, so all this is here signified by “after these things I saw.” 417a.

[2] This has been said to make known that “the earth,” in the nearest sense, means the spiritual world; nor could any other earth appear to John, since it was seen by him when he was in the spirit; and when man is in the spirit he sees nothing on our globe, but only what is in the spiritual world. This is why John saw four angels, and these were standing upon the four corners of that earth. There were four angels seen, because these standing “on four corners” signify the Divine proceeding from the Lord in the whole spiritual world, for the four quarters, namely, the eastern, western, southern, and northern, constitute the whole of that world, for that world is thus divided; and those who are in the good of love to the Lord dwell in the eastern quarter, likewise in the western, the former in clear because interior good of love, the latter in obscure because exterior good of love; those who are in the clear light of truth dwell in the southern quarter, and those who are in the obscure light of truth in the northern. (But on these quarters see in the work Heaven and Hell, n. 141–153, where they are treated of.) And because all things have reference to the good of love and to the"

These quarters are meant also in the Word by “the four winds,” and here by “the four corners.” It is evident, therefore, that the angels were not seen standing on the four corners of the earth, but in the four quarters. The quarters are called “the four corners” because “corners” signify the outermost parts, and the outermost parts signify all things, because they include all. [3] That “corners” signify quarters is evident from the passages in the Word, where quarters are designated as “corners,” as in the following. In Moses: Thou shalt make for the tabernacle twenty boards for the south corner southward. And for the second side of the tabernacle, towards the north corner, twenty boards (Exod. 26:18, 20; 27:9, 11; 36:21, 23, 25). “For the south corner” means for the southern quarter; and “towards the north corner” means towards the northern quarter, for there were twenty boards for each side. So in Ezekiel: Next the border of Dan, from the east corner even to the west corner, Asher one. And thence next the border of Asher, from the east corner even unto the corner towards the west (48:1–8). These shall be the measures: the north corner four thousand and five hundred, and the south corner the same, and from the east corner the same, and the west corner the same, next the border to the east corner towards the west (48:16, 17, 23–28, 33, 34; also 47:17–20). In Moses: Ye shall measure without the city the corner towards the east two thousand cubits, and the south corner the same, and the west corner and the north corner the same (Num. 35:5). Also in Joshua (15:5; 18:12, 14, 15, 20). Here the east, south, west, and north corners mean the sides towards the east, south, west, and north quarters. This makes clear that the “four angels standing"

So elsewhere in Revelation: Satan shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth (20:8). [4] “Four corners” are mentioned, and not four quarters, because “corners” also signify all things, since they are outermost parts, for the outermost parts comprehend all things from the center to the last circumferences, for they are the last borders. This is why four horns were placed on the four corners of the altar, and upon them the blood was poured, and thus expiation was made for the whole altar (as is evident from Exod. 27:2; 29:12; 30:2, 3, 10; 38:2; Lev. 4:7, 18, 25, 30, 34; 16:18, 19; Ezek. 41:22; 43:20). [5] That “corners” signify all things because the outermost parts (for the reason stated above, that the outermost parts include and comprehend all things) is clearly evident from some of the statutes given to the sons of Israel, as: That they should not round or shave the corner of their head (Lev. 19:27). That they should not shave off the corner of their beard (Lev. 19:27; 21:5). And that they should not wholly finish the corners of their field when they reaped (Lev. 19:9; 23:22). Why such statutes were given them cannot be known unless it is known what is signified by “the hair of the head,” by “the beard,” by “the field,” and also by “the corner”; “the hair of the head,” and “the beard” signify the ultimate of man’s life, which is called the corporeal sensual; and “field” signifies the church, and “reaping” the truth of doctrine. By these statutes, therefore, it was represented that the ultimates must be preserved because they signify all things; for unless there are outermost things, the middle things are not kept together, but are dispersed, comparatively as the interior parts of man would be dispersed if he were not encompassed by skins. It is similar in everything, thus in what is signified by “the hair of the"

And as “a field” signified the church, and “harvest” its truths, so “not to finish wholly the corners of thy field when thou reapest” signifies the conservation of all things that are signified by “the harvest of the field.” 417b. [6] That “corners” signify all things because they signify outermost things can be seen also from the following passages. In Moses: I will hurl them into the extreme corners; I will make the remembrance of them to cease from man (Deut. 32:26). “To hurl into the extreme corners” signifies to be deprived of all good and truth; it is therefore added, “I will make the remembrance of them to cease from a man,” which signifies that they would no longer have anything of spiritual life, which comes to pass when man is merely in the ultimates of life, called the corporeal sensual, in which alone most of those are who acquire nothing of spiritual life; for such then become not unlike the beasts, for this is the kind of life beasts have, but with this difference, that as man is born a man he is able to speak and to reason, but this he does from the fallacies of the senses, or of the outermost things of nature, of the world, and of the body; this is what is meant here by “being hurled into the extreme corners.” [7] In Jeremiah: Their camels shall be for a prey, and the multitude of their cattle for a spoil; and I will disperse them unto every wind among the cut off of the corner; and from all the passages thereof I will bring calamity (49:32). This is said of the devastation of Arabia and Hazor by the king of Babylon; and “Arabia” and “Hazor” signify the knowledges of good and truth, and “the king of Babylon” signifies evil and falsity laying"

The vastation of all confirming knowledges (scientifica), and cognitions of good and truth is signified by “their camels shall be for a prey, and the multitude of their cattle for a spoil”; “camels” meaning confirming knowledges (scientifica), and “cattle” the cognitions of good and truth. Vastation in respect to all things of good and truth, so that there is nothing left, is signified by “I will disperse them unto every wind, among the cut off of the corner”; “the cut off of the corner” meaning the outermost parts where there is no longer any good and truth. That evils and falsities will then break in on every side is signified by “from all the passages thereof I will bring calamity”; for in the spiritual world where the evil are, on every side ways from the hells are open, and evils and their falsities break in through these; and all who are in like evils and falsities go through these ways and consociate themselves with the evil there. This has been said to make known what is signified by “from all the passages I will bring calamity”; “to be for a prey and a spoil,” and “to disperse and to bring calamity” signify devastation. [8] In the same: Behold, the days come in which I will visit upon everyone that is circumcised in the foreskin; Egypt, and Judah, and Edom, and the sons of Ammon, and Moab, and all the cut off of the corner that dwell in the wilderness; for all nations are uncircumcised, and the whole house of Israel is uncircumcised in heart (Jer. 9:25, 26). Here “the cut off of the corner” signify those who are in the ultimates of the church separate from the interiors, which are spiritual, thus those who are only in things sensual, which are the ultimates of the natural man. (Respecting those who are merely sensual, who and of what quality they are see the New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine, n. 50.) These are signified by “the cut off of the corner,” because “corners” signify the quarters of the spiritual world, and the quarters of the spiritual world signify all the goods and truths of heaven and the church, as has been said previously. The habitations of spirits and angels in that world succeed in such an order that those who are in the highest wisdom and intelligence are in the midst, and from the midst even to the last circumferences those in less and less degree; and these diminutions are in exact accord with the distances from the midst; in the ultimates are those"

These are the ones meant by “the cut off of the corner”; and as these are desert places, they are said “to dwell in the wilderness.” (On these diminutions in the spiritual world, see in the work Heaven and Hell, n. 43, 50, 189.) The same are meant by “the uncircumcised nations” and “the house of Israel uncircumcised in heart”; “the uncircumcised” signifying those who are without love and charity, thus without good, and therefore in the loves of self and of the world; and those who are in these loves are in the ultimates of the natural man wholly separate from things spiritual; therefore they are “the cut off of the corner that dwell in the wilderness”; “Egypt, Judah, Edom, the sons of Ammon, and Moab,” mean all who, through these loves, have separated from themselves the goods and truths of the church, consequently are outside of these, and thus are “the cut off of the corner”: The cut off of the corners (Jer. 25:23); have a similar signification. [9] In Moses: There shall arise a star out of Jacob, and a scepter shall arise out of Israel, which shall break in pieces the corners of Moab (Num. 24:17). “The corners of Moab” mean all things that are signified by “Moab”; and “Moab” signifies those who are in the ultimates of the Word, of the church, and of worship; and in the contrary sense those who adulterate these by turning themselves towards self, and having regard to their own honor in every particular of these; therefore “the corners of Moab” mean adulterations of the Word, and thence of the church and of worship, such as are with those of that character: The corner of Moab (Jer. 48:45); has a similar signification."

This makes clear what is signified by “a day of the trumpet and alarm upon the fenced cities and upon the high corners.” In the same: I will cut off the nations; their corners shall be laid waste; I will make desolate their streets that none may pass by; and I will lay waste their cities so that there is no inhabitant (Zeph. 3:6). The destruction of all the goods of the church is signified by “I will cut off the nations, and their corners shall be laid waste”; “nations” meaning the goods of the church, and “corners” all things of it, because its outermost parts (as above). The destruction of the truths of doctrine is signified by “I will make desolate their streets and I will lay waste their cities”; “streets” meaning truths, and “cities” doctrinals; total destruction even until there is no truth and good left is signified by “that none pass by, and there is no inhabitant”; for “to pass by” in the Word is predicated of truths, and “to dwell” of goods. [11] In the book of Judges: All the sons of Israel went out, and the congregation was assembled as one man, from Dan even to Beersheba. And the corners of all the people, all the tribes of Israel presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God (20:1, 2). “The corners of all the people presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God” signifies all on every side, or from every quarter, as is clearly evident from its being said that “all the sons of Israel and all the tribes of Israel went out, and the congregation was assembled from Dan to Beersheba”; but in the spiritual sense, “the corners of all the people” signify all the truths and goods of the church; so, too, “all the tribes of Israel, from Dan even to"

[12] From this what is signified by “corner stone” in the following passages becomes evident. In Isaiah: I will lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a proved stone, a precious corner stone, of a foundation that is founded (28:16). In Jeremiah: They shall not take of thee a stone for a corner, nor a stone of foundations (51:26). In Zechariah: Out of Judah the corner, out of him the nail, out of him the bow of war (10:4). In David: The stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner (Ps. 118:22; see also Matt. 21:42; Mark 12:10, 11; Luke 20:17, 18). “The stone of the corner” signifies all Divine truth upon which heaven and the church are founded, thus every foundation; and as the foundation is the ultimate upon which a house or temple rests, therefore it signifies all things. Because “the stone of the corner” signifies all things upon which the church is founded it is said “I will lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a proved stone, a precious cornerstone, of a foundation that is founded”; and it is called also “a stone for a corner” and “a stone of foundations”; and because “the stone of the corner” signifies all Divine truth upon which the church is founded, it also signifies the Lord in respect to His"

(That ultimates signify all things, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 634, 5897, 6239, 6451, 6465, 9216, 9824, 9828, 9836, 9905, 10044, 10099, 10329, 10335, 10548.) 418a. Holding the four winds of the earth, signifies the moderation of its influx. This is evident from the signification of “the four winds of the earth” as being everything Divine in heaven (of which presently); also from the signification of “holding them,” as being to moderate its influx. But what is meant by moderating the influx of the Divine in heaven no one can know unless it is revealed to him, nor consequently can it be known what is signified by “holding the four winds of the earth.” Without revelation, who would not think that “winds” here mean winds held back by angels, since it also follows “that the wind should not blow upon the earth, nor upon the sea, nor upon any tree.” But “the winds of the earth,” here as elsewhere in the Word signify everything Divine that is from the Lord in heaven, in particular, Divine truth, and because Divine truth flows from the Lord as a sun into the whole heaven, and from that into the whole earth, so “holding the winds” signifies to moderate influx. But that these things may be more clearly understood, it shall be told how it is with respect to that influx. The Lord is the sun of the angelic heaven; from Him as a sun all light and all heat there proceed. The light that proceeds is in its essence Divine truth, because it is spiritual light; and the heat that proceeds is in its essence Divine good, because it is spiritual heat. From the Lord as a sun these flow out into all the heavens accommodated to reception by the angels there, thus sometimes more moderately, sometimes more intensely. When they flow out more moderately the good are separated from the evil, but when more intensely the evil are cast out. When, therefore, the last judgment is at hand the Lord first flows in moderately, in order that the good may be separated from the evil. Because this"

It is evident from what follows in this chapter that this refers to the separation of the good from the evil, for it is said, “Hurt not the earth, nor the sea, nor any tree, till we shall have sealed the servants of God on their foreheads” (verse 3); and afterwards, to the end of the chapter, “those sealed,” that is, the good separated from the evil are treated of. But respecting this separation more will be said in what follows, likewise respecting the casting out of the evil into the hells, which takes place afterwards. [2] “The four winds” signify all the Divine proceeding, because “the winds of heaven” signify the quarters of heaven, for the whole heaven is divided into four quarters, namely, east, west, south, and north. Into two quarters, the east and the west, the Lord flows with Divine good more powerfully than with Divine truth; and into two quarters, the south and the north, with Divine truth more powerfully than with Divine good; consequently those who are in the latter are more in wisdom and intelligence, and those in the former more in love and charity; and as the whole heaven is divided into four quarters, and those quarters are meant by “the four winds,” therefore “the four winds” signify all the Divine proceeding. They are called “the four winds of the earth,” because “the earth” means all the earth in the spiritual world, but in the spiritual sense “the earth” signifies heaven and the church (respecting which see the preceding article). 418b. [3] From this the meaning of “the four winds” in other passages of the Word can be seen, as in Ezekiel: The Lord Jehovih said unto me, Prophesy about the spirit, prophesy, and say to the spirit, Thus the Lord Jehovih hath said, Come from the four winds, O spirit, and breathe into these slain that they may live. And when I had prophesied the spirit came, and they revived (37:9, 10). This is said of “the dry bones” seen by the prophet, by which the sons of Israel are meant (as is evident from verse 11 there); and this vision describes the reformation and establishment of a new church"

In the sense of the letter, “spirit” here means the breath (spiritus) of respiration, which is wind; it is therefore said that it should “come and breathe into these slain”; but the breath of respiration signifies as well the spiritual life, as will appear from what follows. “The slain” have a similar signification as “dry bones,” namely, those who have no spiritual life. [4] In Zechariah: There were seen four chariots coming out from between two mountains of copper, to which there were horses; and the angel said, These are the four winds of the heavens, going forth from standing by the Lord of the whole earth (5:1, 5). This treats of the church which is to be extended among those who have not yet been in any light of truth of the church, because they have not had the Word. What “the four chariots” and “the four horses,” and the many things respecting them signify, may be seen above (n. 355b), and what “the mountains of copper” signify, also above (n. 364b, 405d), where they are explained. Here “the four winds” signify every Divine proceeding, or the Divine good and Divine truth that constitute the church; it is therefore said “the winds of the heavens going forth from standing by the Lord of the whole earth”; “to go forth from standing by Him” signifying to proceed. “Chariots” and “horses” are called winds because “chariots” signify the doc-trinals of good and truth, and “horses” an understanding of them, and both of these proceed from the Divine of the Lord.

All the successive states of the church, even to its end, when the last judgment takes place, are here predicted by the Lord; and “the angels with a great sound of a trumpet” signifies proclaiming the good tidings respecting the Lord; and “gathering together the elect from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other end,” signifies the establishment of a new church; “the elect” mean those who are in the good of love and of faith; “the four winds” mean all states of good and truth; “from one end of the heavens to the other end” means the internals and the externals of the church. (This may be seen more clearly explained in Arcana Coelestia, n. 4060.) [6] In Daniel: The he-goat made himself very great; but when he was strong the great horn was broken, and there came up in appearance four in its place towards the four winds of the heavens (8:8). What is meant by “the he-goat” and “ram” in this chapter may be seen above (n. 316e), namely, that “he-goat” signifies faith separate from charity, and therefore those who expect to be saved because they know the doctrinals and truth of the Word, and who give no thought to a life according to them; “horns” signify truths, and in the contrary sense, as here, falsities; “the great horn” signifies the ruling falsity, which is, that salvation comes merely through knowing and thus believing; “the great horn was broken, and there came up four in its place toward the four winds of heaven,” signifies that out of the one principle, faith alone, many falsities conjoined with evils arise; “the great horn” signifying the ruling falsity, which is, that faith alone saves; “broken” signifying its division into many falsities arising therefrom; “four in its place” signifying the conjunction of these with evils; “toward the four winds of the heavens,” signifying in respect to each and all things of falsity and evil, for “the four winds of heaven” signify every good and truth of heaven and the church and their conjunction, but in"

[7] In this same sense “the winds of the heavens” are mentioned in Jeremiah: Upon Elam will I bring the four winds from the four ends of the heavens, and I will disperse him toward all those winds, that there may be no nation to which the outcasts of Elam shall not come (49:36). Here “Elam” signifies those who are in the knowledges that are called the knowledges of faith, but not at the same time in any charity; “the four winds from the four ends of the heavens” signify falsities conjoined with evils; and “to disperse him toward all those winds” signifies into falsities of evil of every kind; “that there may be no nation to which the outcasts of Elam shall not come” signifies that there may be no evil to which falsity cannot be adapted, “nation” meaning evil, for knowledges alone without a life of charity bring forth innumerable falsities of evil. [8] In Daniel: I was seeing in my vision when it was night, and behold, the four winds of the heavens rushed upon the great sea. And four great beasts came up from the sea (7:2, 3). Here, too, “the four winds” signify falsities conjoined with evils, “the great sea” signifies hell from which they are, and “the four beasts” signify evils of every kind: but on this more in what follows. “The four winds” have a similar signification in Daniel (11:4); also in Zechariah (2:6, 7). That “the four winds” signify the four quarters is clearly evident in Ezekiel (42:16–19), where the measure of the house according to the four winds, that is, the four quarters, is treated of; and there the quarter is named by the same word in"

That the wind should not blow, signifies that the good be not injured, and the evil be not cast out before the day. This is evident from the signification of “wind,” as meaning the Divine proceeding, which is Divine good united to Divine truth; therefore “that the wind should not blow” signifies that the influx might be moderate and gentle; “the wind not blowing upon the earth” signifies that the good may not be injured, and the evil cast out before the day, because the separations of the good from the evil and the casting out of the evil in the spiritual world are effected by various degrees of moderation and intensity of the Divine proceeding from the Lord as a sun. When this flows in moderately the good are separated from the evil, and when it flows in intensely the evil are cast out; and for the following reasons: when the Divine from the Lord flows in moderately there is everywhere tranquillity and serenity, wherein all appear such as they are in respect to the state of their good, for all then stand forth in light; consequently those who are in good from a spiritual origin are then separated from those who are in good merely from a natural origin; for the Lord looks upon those who are in spiritual good and leads them, and thus separates them. Those who are in good from a spiritual origin are those referred to in what follows where they are said “to be sealed on their foreheads,” for they are spiritual, and are angels of heaven; but those who are merely in good from a natural origin are not good because they are not spiritual, for the good appearing with them is evil, because it has regard to self and the world as an end. Such do good in external form with reference to their own glory, honor, and gain, and not with reference to the neighbor’s good, consequently they do good only that they may be seen of men. Those who are merely natural are those who are “not sealed,” and who are afterwards rejected. But when the Divine from the Lord flows in intensely, the goods with the evils are dispersed, because these goods are in themselves not goods but evils, and evils do not endure the influx of the Divine. This causes the externals in such to be closed up, and when these are closed up the interiors are opened,"

[2] When the influx of the Divine is intensified, which occurs when the evil are to be cast out, then lower down in the spiritual world a wind springs up that blows strongly like a storm or tempest; this wind is what is called in the Word “the east wind” (of which presently). The casting down of the evil is described also in the Word by violent and impetuous winds, by storms, and by tempests. “The wind of Jehovah” has a similar signification as “the spirit of Jehovah,” for the wind of respiration is meant, which is also called spirit (or breath). On this account in the Hebrew and many other languages spirit is expressed by the same word as wind. This is why the greater part of mankind have no other idea of spirit and of spirits than of wind like the wind of respiration; and from this have come the notions in the learned world also that spirits and angels are like wind in which there is merely a vital principle of thought; and this is the reason also that so few of these allow themselves to be persuaded that spirits and angels are men, endowed with body, face, and organs of sensation, like men on the earth. “Wind” and “spirit,” in reference to man, signify the life of truth, or a life according to the truths or precepts of the Lord, because respiration, which pertains to the lungs, corresponds to that life, while the heart and its motion corresponds to the life of good. For there are two lives, which should make one in man, the life of truth and the life of good; the life of truth is the life of man’s understanding, while the life of good is the life of his will; for truths have their seat in the understanding because these constitute the understanding, while goods have their seat in the will because these constitute the will. “Soul and heart,” in the Word, when mentioned together, have a similar significance. 419b. [3] From this it can be seen what is meant by “the wind” and “the spirit of Jehovah,” namely, the Divine truth, and by “the four winds,” Divine truth united to Divine good. Since wind means the wind or breath of respiration, and it signifies Divine truth and spiritual life with those who receive it, so this wind is"

In Ezekiel: And I saw, and upon the dry bones, sinews and flesh came up, and skin covered them above, yet there was no breath in them. Then said he unto me, Prophesy about the spirit, prophesy, son of man, and say to the spirit, Thus the Lord Jehovih hath said, Come from the four winds, O spirit, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live (37:8, 9). What is here signified by “the dry bones” was told in the preceding article, namely, those who have no spiritual life, or no life through Divine truth. The breathing in of this life by the Lord is signified by “Prophesy about the spirit, and say to the spirit, Come from the four winds, O spirit, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live.” Here “spirit” evidently means the breath of respiration, for there were sinews, flesh, and skin, but as yet no breathing; therefore it is said, “Say to the spirit, Breathe upon them.” From this it can be seen that this “spirit” or “wind” signifies spiritual life. That common breathing was not meant is evident from its being said that “these dry bones were the house of Israel,” meaning that the house of Israel was without spiritual life; and from its being said of them afterwards, “I will put My spirit in you, that ye may live, and I will place you in your own land that ye may live” (5:14); which signifies that they are to be regenerated that a church may be made of them. Regeneration is effected by a life according to Divine truth, from which is spiritual life; and “to bring them back to the land” signifies that they may become a church, the land of Canaan signifying the church. [4] In Moses: Jehovah God breathed into his nostrils2 the soul of lives, and man became a living soul (Gen. 2:7). Here, too, in the sense of the letter, the wind of breathing is meant, as it is said He “breathed into his nostrils”; but spiritual life, which is the life of intelligence and wisdom through Divine truth, is evidently meant, since it is said that He breathed into him “the soul of lives,” and that thus man became “a living soul”; “the soul of"

This, too, makes evident that “soul,” “spirit,” and “wind” in the Word mean spiritual life. [5] In John: Jesus said to the disciples, Peace be unto you; as the Father hath sent Me, even so send I you. And when He had said this He breathed on them, and said unto them, Receive ye the Holy Spirit (20:21, 22). The Lord “breathed on them, and said to them, Receive ye the Holy Spirit,” signifies the like, as Jehovah “breathed into Adam’s nostrils the soul of lives” namely, spiritual life; for the Holy Spirit signifies Divine truth proceeding from the Lord, from which is spiritual life. That they should teach Divine truth from the Lord is signified by “as the Father hath sent Me, even so send I you”; for the Lord when He was in the world was Divine truth itself, which He taught from His Divine good which was in Him from conception. This Divine is what the Lord here and in other places calls “the Father”; and because when He went out of the world He united Divine truth to Divine good that in Him they might be one, and because thenceforth Divine truth proceeds from Him He said, “as the Father hath sent Me, even so send I you.” 419c. That the wind of respiration signifies spiritual life comes from correspondence (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 3883–3896). The quality of all in the spiritual world is known from their respiration merely. Those who are in the life of the respiration of heaven are among the angels; but those who are not in that respiration, if they come into heaven, are unable to breathe there, and are therefore in anguish like that of suffocation (respecting which see also Arcana Coelestia, n. 1119, 3887, 3889, 3892, 3893). From this correspondence the term “inspiration” is derived, and the prophets are called “inspired,” and the Word is said to be “Divinely inspired.” [6] From all this it can be seen what is signified by the Lord’s words in John:"

The wind bloweth where it willeth, and thou hearest the voice thereof, but knowest not whence it cometh and whither it goeth; so is everyone that is born of the spirit (3:5, 7, 8). “To be born again” means to be regenerated; and as man is regenerated by a life according to Divine truth, and all Divine truth through which man is regenerated proceeds from the Lord, and flows into him he knows not when, so it is said, “The wind bloweth where it willeth, and thou hearest the voice thereof, but knowest not whence it cometh and whither it goeth,” thus is described the life of man’s spirit, which he has by regeneration, “wind” meaning the Divine truth through which he has that life. So long as he is in the world man is utterly ignorant of how Divine truth flows in from the Lord, for he then thinks from the natural man, and merely perceives a something that flows in from the spiritual man into the natural; this therefore is what is meant by “thou hearest the voice thereof, but knowest not whence it cometh and whither it goeth.” The “water” of which man is born signifies truth from the Word, and the “spirit” a life according to it. (That “water” signifies truth, see above, n. 71.) [7] In Lamentations: The breath [spiritus] of our nostrils, the anointed of Jehovah, was taken in their pits; of whom we had said, Under his shadow we shall live among the nations (Lam. 4:20). “The anointed of Jehovah” here means the Lord in respect to Divine truth, for “the anointed of Jehovah” has a similar signification as a king. (That a “king” signifies in the highest sense the Lord in respect to Divine truth, see above, n. 31; and “the anointed of Jehovah” the same, n. 375.) This is why it is said “the breath of our nostrils, of whom we had said, Under his shadow we shall live”; for “the spirit and breath of the nostrils” signifies in the highest sense Divine truth, as has been said above. That Divine truth perished through falsities of evil is signified by “was taken in their pits”; “pits” meaning the falsities of evil. [8] Again in Lamentations:"

[9] In Moses: Everything that had in its nostrils the breath of the spirit of lives, of all that was on the dry land, died (Gen. 7:22). What these words signify in the sense of the letter everyone can see, namely, that all things upon the earth were destroyed by the flood, thus all men then living, except Noah and his sons; but what these words signify in the spiritual sense may be seen in Arcana Coelestia (n. 805, 806, where they are explained), namely, that “the breath of the spirit of lives in the nostrils” means spiritual life, which those had who were of the most ancient church; for “the flood” signifies the end of that church and the last judgment, which took place when everything of the church was extinct. In David: They have ears but they hear not; neither is there any breath (ventus) in their mouth (Ps. 135:17); “no breath in their mouth” signifying that there was no truth in the thought, for “mouth” signifies thought. [10] In Jeremiah: The wild asses pant for breath like whales; their eyes were consumed because there was no herb (14:6). “To pant for breath like whales” signifies that there is no truth to be imbibed; “because there was no herb” means because there is no"

As the evil are cast down by a more powerful influx of Divine truth and good proceeding from the Lord as a sun, as has been said above, so the casting down of those who are in the falsities of evil is described also by “the breath of the nostrils of Jehovah.” As in Isaiah: Topheth is prepared of old; the pile thereof is fire and much wood made ready; the breath of Jehovah like a brook of brimstone doth kindle them (30:33). In David: The channels of waters appeared, and the foundations of the world were disclosed, at the rebuke of Jehovah, at the blast of the breath of Thy nostrils (Ps. 18:15). In Moses: By the breath of Thy nostrils the waters were heaped up; Thou didst blow with Thy wind, the sea covered them (Exod. 15:8, 10). And in Job: Plotters of iniquity, by the blast of God they perish, by the breath of His nostrils are they consumed (4:8, 9). In all these passages “the blast,” “the breath,” and “the breathing of the nostrils of Jehovah” means the Divine proceeding, which disperses and casts down the evil when it flows in intensely and strongly; but respecting this influx more will be said in what follows, where “tempests,” “storms,” and “the east wind” are treated of. 419d. [11] Again, that “the wind of the earth” also signifies the Divine proceeding is also from correspondence with the winds in the spiritual world; for there exist winds in the spiritual world also, and these arise from the determining of Divine influx, and arise in the lower parts of the earth there.

As in David: Jehovah layeth the beams of His upper chambers in the waters; He maketh the clouds His chariot; He walketh upon the wings of the wind; He maketh His angels winds, His ministers a flaming fire (Ps. 104:3, 4). “Waters,” “clouds,” and “wings of the wind,” signify Divine truth in ultimates, such as is the truth of the sense of the letter of the Word; because this is in ultimates, it is said “He layeth the beams of His chambers in the waters, He maketh the clouds His chariot, He walketh upon the wings of the wind”; “waters” meaning truths in ultimates, likewise “clouds,” and “the wings of the wind” and “chariots” meaning the truth of doctrine; “He maketh His angels winds, and His ministers a flaming fire,” signifies that He makes them to be receptions of Divine truth and Divine good; “angels” mean those who are in the Lord’s spiritual kingdom, and because such are recipients of Divine truth it is said “He maketh them winds”; while “ministers” mean those who are in the Lord’s celestial kingdom, and as these are recipients of the Divine good it is said “He maketh them a flaming fire”; “a flaming fire” signifying the good of love and the truth therefrom. (That those who are in the Lord’s spiritual kingdom are recipients of Divine truth, and those who are in the celestial kingdom recipients of Divine good, see in the work Heaven and Hell, n. 20–28; that angels are called “angels” from reception of Divine truth, see above, n. 130, 412b; and that ministers are called “ministers” from the reception of Divine good, see also above, n. 155; and that “fire” signifies the good of love, n. 68.)

And in David: He maketh the vapors to go up from the ends of the earth; He maketh lightnings for the rain; and He bringeth forth the wind out of His treasuries (Ps. 135:7). This describes in the spiritual sense the reformation of man and the establishment of the church. Because of that reformation and establishment the Lord is called “the Maker of the earth,” and elsewhere “the Former” and “Creator”; “earth” meaning the church. The Divine good, by which reformation is effected, is signified by “He prepareth the world by His wisdom”; “world” means the church, and is predicated of good. The Divine truth, which is also a means, is signified by “at the voice that He uttereth there is a multitude of waters in the heavens”; “the voice that He uttereth” signifying the influx of Divine truth, and “the multitude of waters in the heavens” reception; “waters” meaning truths. Ultimate truths, which are the knowledges from the sense of the letter of the Word, are signified by “the vapors from the ends of the earth”; spiritual truths therefrom are signified by “lightnings for the rain,” “lightnings” called from the light of heaven, and “rain” from influx; thus reformation through Divine truth from the Lord is signified by “He bringeth forth the wind out of His treasuries.” This is the meaning of all these things in the heavens.

Here knowledges and cognitions which are in man before reformation are signified by “hail like morsels; who can stand before His cold?”—for man before reformation is utterly frigid, and that coldness is also plainly felt when the Divine flows in out of heaven; and as such coldnesses are dissipated by the reception of Divine good and Divine truth, thus by reformation, it is said, “He sendeth His word, He melteth them; He maketh His wind to blow, the waters flow”; “word” signifying Divine good united to Divine truth, “wind” Divine truth, and “the waters flow,” the reception of truth; and this being the signification of these words it is added, “He declareth His word unto Jacob, His statutes and judgments unto Israel”; “Jacob” and “Israel” signifying the church, “Jacob” the church that is in good, and “Israel” the church that is in truths; “statutes and judgments” mean external and internal truths which are from good. [15] In the same: Praise Jehovah, fire and hail, snow and vapor; stormy wind doing His word (Ps. 148:7, 8). “Fire and hail, snow and vapor, and wind,” evidently signify something different from these, for why should it be said of such things in the Divine Word that “they praised Jehovah”? But “fire and hail, and snow and vapors” signify the delights of the loves of the natural man, and its knowledges and cognitions; for these are “fire and hail, and snow and vapor” before man is reformed and made spiritual, the sphere of life of such when it flows out from them, presenting in the spiritual world appearances like these; and the worship of the Lord from these things is signified by their “praising Jehovah,” “to praise” meaning to worship; “stormy wind” signifies Divine truth in respect to reception; it is therefore said “stormy wind doing His word”; “doing His word” signifying to receive into life the things of doctrine."

[18] In Hosea: Ephraim feedeth on wind, and pursueth the east wind; every day he multiplieth lying and devastation, and they make a covenant with Assyria, and oil is carried down into Egypt (12:1). “Ephraim” signifies the intellectual of the church; “Assyria” reasoning, and “Egypt” the knowing faculty (scientificum); therefore “Ephraim feedeth on wind, and pursueth the east wind,” signifies that the intelligent in the church imbue themselves with falsities which altogether disperse truths; “wind” meaning falsity, and “east wind” falsity drying up and dispersing truths. Because of this signification of “wind” and “east wind” it is added, “every day he multiplieth lying and devastation”; “lying” meaning falsity, and “devastation” the dispersion of truth; “they make a covenant with Assyria, and oil is carried down into Egypt,” signifies that by reasonings from knowledges (scientifica) falsely applied they pervert the truths and goods of the church; “to make a covenant with Assyria” signifying to reason from falsities and to destroy truths, and “to carry down oil into Egypt” signifying to destroy the good of the church by knowledges; for he who is in principles of falsity applies to them the knowledges he has imbibed from childhood, since his understanding sees nothing else. For the understanding is formed either of truths or of falsities; if of truths, man sees truths, if of falsities he sees falsities; he sees them in the natural man, in the memory of which knowledges have their seat; and from these he selects such as favor his principles, and those that do not favor them he either perverts or rejects.

The wind hath bound her up in its wings, and they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices (Hos. 4:17–19). “Ephraim” signifies the church in respect to the understanding of truth; here that it has no understanding of truth but of falsity; the falsities of the church are signified by “idols”; which makes clear what is signified by “Ephraim is joined to idols”; “the wind in its wings” signifies reasoning from fallacies, from which are falsities. (What the rest signifies see above, n. 283e, and 376g, where it is explained.) Wind in the wings (Zech. 5:9); has a similar meaning. In Jeremiah: Their camels shall be for prey, and the multitude of their cattle for a spoil; and I will disperse them to every wind, them that are the cut off of the corner (49:32). “To disperse them to every wind” signifies into every falsity and evil when truths and goods are destroyed. (The rest may be seen explained above, n. 417b.) [20] In Ezekiel: A third part thou shalt disperse to the wind, and I will draw out a sword after them (5:2, 12). This is said of the hairs of the head and of the beard, which the prophet, by command, shaved off with a razor; and those hairs signify the ultimate of truth in the church, for the whole heaven and the whole church are before the Lord as one man; whence all things of heaven and of the church correspond to all things of man, both to those without man and to those within him (on which correspondence, see in the work Heaven and Hell, n. 87–102); therefore the hairs of the head and of the beard, as they are the ultimate things of man, correspond to the ultimates of truth and good. The ultimates of truth and good are such as are the ultimate truths of the sense of the letter of the Word.

Unless this signification of “hairs” is known, who could understand what is involved in the command to the prophet that “he should shave off the hairs of his head and of his beard, and a third part he should burn in the midst of the city, a third part he should smite with a sword round about it, and a third part he should disperse unto every wind, and that a sword should be drawn out after them”? [21] That this signifies the falsification of truth by the Jews is clearly evident from what follows in the same chapter, where among other things it is said: This is Jerusalem; she hath altered My judgments into wickedness more than the nations, and My statutes more than the lands that are round about her (Ezek. 5:5, 6). All his bands I will disperse unto every wind; and I will draw out the sword after them (12:14). This has a similar signification. In Matthew: The rain descended and the winds blew and beat upon that house, yet it fell not; for it was founded upon a rock (7:24, 25, 27). “The rain descended and the winds blew” signifies temptations, and consequently falsities rushing in; for spiritual temptations are nothing else than infestations of the mind by falsities and evils, so here, too, “winds” signify falsities.

When from the Lord as a sun the Divine is sent forth powerfully and flows into these dense and dark clouds, a tempest arises which is perceived by spirits there in like manner as tempests on the earth are perceived by men. It has at different times been granted me to perceive these tempests and also the east wind by which the evil were dispersed and cast into the hells, when the last judgment was in progress. From this it can be seen what “tempests,” “storms,” and “violent winds” signify in the following passages. In Isaiah: Thou shalt disperse them, that the wind may carry them away and the tempest scatter them (41:16). In Jeremiah: Behold,3 the tempest of Jehovah has gone forth in wrath, a whirling tempest; it shall hurl itself upon the head of the wicked (23:19; 30:23). In David: I will speed my escape from the rushing wind, from the tempest (Ps. 55:8). O my God, pursue them with Thy tempest, and affright them with Thy storm (Ps. 83:13, 15). In Ezekiel: I will make a wind of tempests to break through in My wrath, and in Mine anger there shall be an overflowing rain, for a consummation (13:13).

In Nahum: Jehovah hath His way in the storm and in the tempest (1:3). In Zechariah: The Lord Jehovih shall blow with the trumpet, and shall go with tempests of the south (9:14).

But Jesus was in the stern, slumbering on a pillow; and they awake Him, and say unto Him, Carest Thou not that we perish? And He awoke, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Be still, be dumb. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm (4:37–39). And in Luke: As they sailed Jesus fell asleep; and there came down a storm of wind on the lake, and they were filling4 [with water], and were in danger; and coming to Him they awoke Him, saying, Master, Master, we perish. And having awakened, He rebuked the wind and the raging of the sea; and they ceased, and there was a calm (8:23, 24). This miracle of the Lord, like all the rest, involves arcana of heaven and interior things of the church. The difference between Divine miracles and those not Divine is that Divine miracles also signify Divine things, because the Divine is in them, while miracles not Divine signify nothing, because there is nothing of the Divine within them; and moreover, in the description of the Divine miracles in the Word, and in every particular thereof, there is a spiritual sense. This miracle involves spiritual temptations; “a great storm of wind, so that the waves beat into the boat, and it was filling,” signifies such temptations; and that when they were in extreme fear, “Jesus awoke, and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, Be still, be dumb; and the wind ceased, and there was a great calm,” signifies deliverance from temptations.

This, too, is plain from the rebuke of the wind and the waves, and from the words of the Lord to the sea, “Be still, be dumb,” as if He were speaking to those things or those persons that induce temptations. [25] Furthermore, the winds that spring up in the spiritual world appear to arise there from different quarters, some from the south, some from the north, and some from the east; those from the south disperse truths with such as are in falsities, and those from the east disperse goods with such as are in evils. The winds disperse these because the winds spring from a powerful and strong influx of the Divine through the heavens into the parts below, and where the influx enters it fills truths and goods, that is, it fills the minds and spirits of those who are in truths and goods with the Divine; therefore those, the interiors of whose mind and spirit consist merely of falsities and evils, while exteriorly truths are mixed with falsities and goods are mixed with evils, cannot endure such influx from the Divine, consequently they withdraw into their falsities and evils which they love, and reject the truths and goods, which they do not love except for the sake of self and appearance. [26] This makes clear what effect is there produced by the wind coming from the east, which is called “the east wind,” namely, that with the evil it disperses all the goods and truths which they presented in external form before the world, and all the truths which they talked about for the sake of appearances. This is why withering and drying up are ascribed to that wind, “withered” signifying where there is no good, and “dried up” where there is no truth, as can be seen from passages in the Word where that wind is mentioned. As in Ezekiel: Behold the vine planted, when the east wind shall touch it, in drying up shall it not dry up? (17:10). The vine was plucked up in Mine anger, she was cast down to the earth, and the east wind withered her fruit; and the rods of her strength were broken and withered (19:12). In Hosea:"

In Jonah: And it came to pass when the sun arose that God prepared a scorching east wind (4:8). [27] Moreover, the east wind also destroys all things where the evil are, their lands, their habitations, and their treasures (as may be seen in the little work on the Last Judgment, n. 61); it destroys because the lands, habitations, and treasures in the spiritual world are correspondences; therefore when these perish the things that correspond also perish; on this account, when a land in that world on which the evil dwell is destroyed there rises up the aspect of a new land for the good. Because there is such a force in the east wind in the spiritual world, so for the sake of the correspondence: An east wind was brought by which the waters of the Red Sea were dried up (Exod. 14:21); And that brought on the locusts (10:13); It is called a hard wind (Isa. 27:8); A wind that broke the ships of Tarshish (Ps. 48:7); A wind that broke Tyre in the heart of the seas (Ezek. 27:26); And that scattered enemies (Jer. 18:17). 420.

This is evident from the signification of “the earth,” as being the whole spiritual world, consequently all angels and spirits there. This is the signification of “the earth” in the general and nearest sense, because in the spiritual world, the same as on our globe, there are lands, mountains, hills, plains, valleys, and also seas (respecting which see above, n. 304a, 342b,"

It is evident also from the signification of the “sea,” as being the ultimates of the earth in the spiritual world, because the last boundaries or limits there are seas (respecting which see above, n. 342b, c); also from the signification of “tree,” as being perception and also knowledge (of which presently). This being the signification of “earth,” “sea,” and “tree,” the three joined together in one idea signify all things in the spiritual world even to its ultimates in those who have any perception. A “tree” in general signifies perception and knowledge, because a “garden” signifies intelligence, and all intelligence is according to knowledges and a perception of them; this is why each kind of tree signifies something pertaining to knowledge (scientia) and intelligence. Because a “tree” signifies in general perception and knowledge, it also signifies the interiors of the mind with man, and also the whole man; for a man is such as are the interiors that belong to his mind, and these are such as is the perception from knowledges. (That a “tree” signifies the interiors that belong to the mind, and also man himself, see above, n. 109, 110; that a “tree” signifies perception and knowledge, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 103, 2163, 2682, 2722, 2972, 7692; that the ancients had Divine worship in groves under trees, according to their significations, n. 2722, 4552; that this was prohibited with the Jewish nation, and why, n. 2722; that “paradises” and “gardens” signify intelligence, n. 100, 108, 3220; also in the work Heaven and Hell, n. 176; and above, n. 110.) 421.

Verse 2. And I saw another angel ascending from the rising of the sun, signifies the Divine love going forth from the Lord. This is evident from the signification of “angel,” as being something Divine proceeding from the Lord; for “angel” in the Word means, in the nearest sense, an entire angelic society, but in a general sense “angel” signifies everyone who receives Divine truth in doctrine and life; while in the highest sense “angel” signifies something Divine proceeding from the Lord, and in particular Divine truth (respecting these significations of an angel see above, n. 90, 130, 200, 302, 307); here, therefore, “the angel ascending from the rising of the sun” signifies the Divine proceeding from the Lord’s love; “the rising of the sun” or the “east” signifying the Lord’s Divine love, and “to ascend therefrom” signifying to go forth and proceed; so here “the angel ascending from the rising of the sun” signifies the Divine love going forth from the Lord. The things that follow are also of the Divine love, namely, that the good be not harmed. “The rising of the sun” signifies the Lord’s Divine love, because the Lord is the sun in the angelic heaven, and the Lord appears as a sun from His Divine love; where the Lord appears as a sun, there in heaven is the east, and as the sun is constantly there it is also constantly in its rising. [2] In the spiritual world there are four quarters, namely, east, west, south, and north; and these quarters are all determined by the sun, which is the Lord; where this sun is, there is the east, opposite to it is the west, to the right the south, and to the left the north. In the eastern quarter angels who are in love to the Lord dwell, because they are under the nearest auspices of the Lord, for the Lord most nearly and directly flows into them from Divine love, and this is why “the rising of the sun” and the “east” signify in the Word the Lord’s Divine love. (That the Lord appears in the angelic heaven as a sun, and that it is the Lord’s Divine love that thus appears, see in the work Heaven and Hell, n. 116–125; consequently that the “sun” signifies in the Word the Divine love, see above, n. 401; that all the quarters in the spiritual world are"

[3] The quarters, namely, the east, west, south, and north, are frequently mentioned in the Word, and he who knows nothing about the spiritual sense of the Word believes that this means the quarters of our solar world, and thus supposes that no arcana of heaven and the church are involved therein; and yet the quarters mentioned in the Word mean the quarters in the spiritual world; which are altogether different from the quarters in our world; for there all angels and spirits have their dwelling places in the quarters according to the quality of their good and truth; those who are in the good of love to the Lord dwelling there in the east and the west, and those who are in truths from that good dwelling in the south and north. They dwell in this manner because the Lord there is the sun, and from Him as the sun are all heat and light, or all good and truth. The heat there, which is spiritual heat or the good of love, inflows directly from the east into the west, and decreases according to reception by the angels, consequently according to the distances, for in the spiritual world all distance from the Lord is in the measure of the reception of good and truth from Him. This is why those who are in interior and thence in clear good of love dwell there in the east, and those who are in exterior and thence obscure good of love dwell in the west. The light, too, which is spiritual light, or Divine truth, flows directly from the east into the west; it also flows into either side, but with the difference, that the Divine truth that flows from the east into the west is in its essence the good of love, while that which flows into either side is in its essence truth from that good; consequently those who dwell in the south and in the north, which are the quarters at the sides, are in the light of truth; those in the south in the clear light of truth, and those in the north in an obscure light of truth; the light of truth is intelligence and wisdom. (But respecting these quarters more may be seen in the work Heaven and Hell, n. 141–153.) These, therefore, are the quarters meant in the Word where quarters are mentioned, and they also signify such Divine things as exist in those quarters; namely, the “east” the good of love in clearness, the “west” the good of love in obscurity, the “south” truth from that"

[4] Furthermore, there are quarters in the spiritual world which differ from those just mentioned, and are removed from them about thirty degrees; these are under the auspices of the Lord as a moon; for the Lord appears as a sun to those who are in love to Him, but as a moon to those who are in charity towards the neighbor and in faith therefrom (respecting this appearance, see also in the work Heaven and Hell, n. 118, 119, 122). In the eastern and western quarters there dwell those who are in the good of charity towards the neighbor; and in the southern and northern quarters those who are in truths from that good, which are called the truths of faith. These quarters are also sometimes meant in the Word, where these truths and this good are treated of. 422b. [5] From this it can be seen that one who knows nothing about the quarters of heaven, which have here been mentioned, cannot know the spiritual things of the Word in the passages where the quarters are mentioned, as in the following. In Isaiah: I will bring in thy seed from the sunrise and bring thee together from the west; I will say to the north, Give up, and to the south, Hold not back; bring in My sons from far, and My daughters from the end of the earth (43:5, 6). This treats of Jacob and Israel, and one who does not know that these quarters mean the spiritual things mentioned above, may believe the meaning to be that the sons of Israel and Jacob are to be gathered from every side; but “Jacob” and “Israel” mean the church, which consists of those who are in the good of love and in truths from that good, and their “seed” means all who are of that church. “I will bring in thy seed from the sunrise, and will bring thee together from the west,” means that those who are in the good of love are to be brought in and gathered together; and “I will say to the north, Give up, and to the south, Hold not back,” means that those who are in truths from that good are to be brought in and gathered together. That all who are in these truths and goods, even to those who are in ultimates shall be brought together, is signified by “bring My sons from far, and My daughters from the"

These quarters have a like signification in the following passages. In David: Jehovah will gather the redeemed out of the lands, from the sunrise and from the west, from the north and from the sea (Ps. 107:3). In Moses: Jehovah said to Jacob in a dream, Thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and shall spread itself towards the west and towards the east, and towards the north and towards the south (Gen. 28:14). In Luke: They shall come from the sunrise and from the west, and from the north and from the south, and shall recline in the kingdom of God (13:29). [6] In many passages the words “from east to west,” and not at the same time “from north and south,” are mentioned, by which all who are in the good of love to the Lord and in the good of charity towards the neighbor are meant. Moreover, these quarters involve the two others, because all who are in good are also in truths, for good and truth everywhere act as one; these, therefore, are meant where “from east to west” is mentioned. In Matthew: Many shall come from the east and even from the west, and shall recline at meat with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of the heavens (8:11). In the passage above cited from Luke (13:29), it is said of those reclining at meat in the kingdom of the heavens that “they shall come from the east and the west, from the north and from the south”; here it is said only “from the east and from the west,” because by these two quarters are meant the other two at the same time as has been said. The same is true of the following passages. In Malachi:"

In general, all angels and spirits have their dwelling places in accordance with the states of good and truth with them in corresponding quarters, as was said above; the same is true in particular; for in all assemblies, those who are present are allotted places in quarters that correspond to the states of their life; in like manner they are seated in their temples there, and in like manner also dwell in their houses: in a word, each and every thing there is arranged in accordance with the quarters of heaven; for the form of heaven is the same in every particular as it is in general.

Then the spirit took me up, and brought me into the inner court; and behold, the glory of Jehovah filled the house (43:1, 2, 4, 5).

That there was seen “the glory of Jehovah entering into the house by the way of the gate whose face is towards the east,” and that “the glory of Jehovah filled the house,” have a like signification; “house” or “temple” signifying heaven and the church. “Glory” in the Word signifies Divine truth proceeding from the Lord; “the glory of the God of Israel” Divine truth illustrating those who are in the Lord’s spiritual kingdom, and “the glory of Jehovah” Divine truth illustrating those who are in the Lord’s celestial kingdom. Divine truth is called “glory” because it is the light of heaven, and from that light come all the splendor, magnificence, and glory there, for in the heavens whatever appears before the eyes is from that light; it is therefore added, “the earth was enlightened by His glory,” “the earth” meaning the church.

And because Divine truth, which is light, proceeds from the Lord as a sun in the angelic heaven, “the glory of Jehovah was seen to go up over the midst of the city, and to stand over the mountain on the east of the city,” for Jerusalem is the city that is meant, and it signifies the church in respect to doctrine; and because the doctrine of the church is from Divine truth, the glory of Jehovah was seen “to go up over the midst of the city,” and because all Divine truth proceeds from the Lord as a sun, and there the east is, the glory was seen “to stand over the mountain on the east of the city”; the mountain on the east of the city was the Mount of Olives.

So, too, the ancients in their adorations turned their faces to the rising of the sun; and so built their temples that the front parts, where the adytum was, should look towards the east, which from the old custom is still done at the present day. Moreover, the whole angelic heaven is turned to the Lord as a sun, thus constantly to the east; furthermore, all the interiors of the angels in the heavens are turned in that direction, and for this reason the angels of heaven turn their faces to the Lord.

[20] In ancient times there was a church in many kingdoms of Asia, as in the land of Canaan, in Syria and Assyria, in Arabia, Ethiopia, Egypt, Chaldea, in Tyre and Sidon, and elsewhere; but the church with them was a representative church, for in all the particulars of their worship, and in every one of their statutes, spiritual and celestial things, which are the internals of the church, were represented, and in the highest sense the Lord Himself was represented. These representatives in worship and statutes remained with many even to the Lord’s coming, and thence there was a knowledge of His coming; as can be seen from the predictions of Balaam, who was from Syria, and who prophesied of the Lord in these words: I see Him, but not now; I behold Him, but not nigh; there shall arise a Star out of Jacob, and a Scepter shall rise out of Israel (Num. 24:17). That this knowledge was afterwards preserved is evident from this, that certain wise men from the east, when the Lord was born saw a star from the east, which they followed, which is thus described in Matthew: In the days of Herod the king wise men from the east came to Jerusalem, saying, where is He that is born King of the Jews? for we saw His star in the east, and have come to worship Him; and lo, the star"

The star appeared to those from the east because the Lord is the east; and because they had knowledge respecting the Lord’s coming from representatives that were with them, the star appeared and went before them, first to Jerusalem, which represented the church itself in respect to doctrine and in respect to the word, and from there to the place where the infant Lord lay. Moreover, a “star” signifies the knowledges of good and truth, and in the highest sense the knowledge respecting the Lord. (That “stars” signify in the Word the knowledges of good and truth, see above, n. 72, 179, 402.) And because the Orientals had such knowledges they were called “sons of the east.” That those from Arabia were so called is evident in Jeremiah (49:28). Also “sons of the east” signify in the Word the knowledges of good and truth; “Kedar,” that is, Arabia, has a similar signification. That Job was one of the sons of the east is evident from Job (1:3). [21] As most things in the Word have also a contrary sense, so does “the east,” and in that sense it signifies the love of self, because this love is the opposite of love to the Lord. In this sense the east is mentioned in Ezekiel (8:16), and in Isaiah (2:6). That “the east” signifies the Lord in respect to Divine love, and thus the good of love to Him, can be more fully seen from what was shown above respecting the sun and the morning (respecting the sun, n. 401; and the morning, n. 176); for where the sun is in the angelic heaven there is the east; and as the morning is where the sun rises, and there the sun is always in its rising and never setting, so “morning” has a like signification. 423. Having the seal of the living God, signifies the Divine will. This is evident from the signification of “having the seal” of anyone, as meaning to have command, for a command is confirmed by a seal; therefore “to have the seal of the living God” means to have Divine command. Here Divine command means the Divine will, because “the angel ascending from the rising of the sun, having the seal,” signifies Divine love proceeding from the Lord; and whatever goes forth from Divine love is the Divine will.

And he cried with a great voice, signifies Divine command. This is evident from the signification of “a great voice,” when from the Lord, as meaning Divine command. The command itself, uttered by the voice, also follows, namely, that “the four angels hurt not the earth, nor the sea, nor the trees, till the servants of God were sealed on their foreheads.” It is said “a great voice” and “he cried,” because “great” and also “crying” are predicated in the Word of the good of love (that “great” is predicated of the good of love, and “many” of truths from good, see above, n. 336a, 337; and “crying” of the affections that are of love, see above, n. 393); here, therefore, as this command was from the Divine love and from the Divine will, it is said, “he cried with a great voice.” 425. To the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea, signifies preventing as yet the influx from becoming intense. This is evident from what was said above, where the separation of the good from the evil by a moderate or gentle influx was treated of (respecting which influx see above, n. 413a, 418a, 419a, c, d), namely, that by a moderate and gentle influx the good are separated from the evil, and by an intense and powerful influx the evil are cast down; and as what now follows treats first of the separation of the good from the evil, and this separation is effected by a moderate influx, these words signify preventing the influx as yet from becoming intense; for “the four angels upon the four corners of the earth holding back the four winds of the earth” signify the Divine proceeding from the Lord, and its influx into the whole spiritual world (see above, n. 417a, 418a); and “the earth and the sea” signify everywhere, even to its ultimates (n. 420)."

That this is the meaning of these words is evident from the series of things in the spiritual sense; for what now follows treats of the separation of the good from the evil, and this separation is signified by “the sealing of the servants of God on their foreheads,” and by the “twelve thousand out of every tribe,” and by those who were seen “clothed in white robes,” for this chapter treats of all these. By both the latter and the former the good are meant who are to be separated from the evil before the evil are cast down into hell. And as the separation of the good from the evil and the casting out of the evil into hell is effected by Divine influx from the Lord as a sun, the separation of the good from the evil by a gentle and moderate influx, and the casting down of the evil into hell by a strong and intense influx (as may be seen above, n. 413a, 418a, 419a, c, d), so these three verses treat of the former influx by which the good are separated from the evil, while the good who are separated are treated of in the rest of the chapter even to the end.

For the good who are not yet raised up into heaven, but are to be raised up after the evil have been cast out, have a very close communication with the evil through the external worship of the evil. For (as was said above, and also in the small work on the Last Judgment, n. 59, 70) the evil, who were allowed to remain till the last judgment, were in external worship but in no internal worship, for they made a show and simulation of the holy things of the church with the mouth and gestures, but not from the soul and heart; and by means of this external worship they maintained communication also with those who were inwardly good.

But when the blade sprang up and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also. But the servants of the householder coming said unto him, Lord, didst thou not sow good seed in thy field? whence then hath it tares? He said unto them, A foe hath done this. But the servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we going gather them up? But he said, Nay, lest haply while ye gather up the tares ye root up at the same time the wheat with them. Let both grow together until the harvest; and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them; but gather the wheat into my barn (13:24–30). “The man that sowed” means the Lord; the “field” means the spiritual world and the church, in which there are both good and evil; the “good seed” and the “wheat” mean the good, and the “tares” mean the evil; that they could not be separated until the time of the last judgment, because of the conjunction described above, is meant by the answer to the servants who wished to gather up the tares before, meaning to separate the evil from the good, namely, “lest haply while ye gather up the tares ye root up at the same time the wheat with them; let both grow together until the harvest,” the “harvest” meaning the last judgment. That this is the signification the Lord Himself teaches in the same chapter where He says: He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man; the field is the world; the [good] seed are the sons of the kingdom; the tares are the sons of the evil one; the harvest is the consummation of the age. As then the tares are gathered up and burned with fire, so shall it be in the consummation of the age (13:37–40).

This latter passage makes evident also that the “good seed” and the “wheat” mean the good, who are here called “the sons of the kingdom”; and that the “tares” mean the evil, who arecalled “the sons of the evil one”; also that the “harvest,” when theseparation is to be effected, means the time of the last judgment, for it is said “the harvest is the consummation of the age.” (“The consummation of the age” means the time of the last judgment, asmay be seen above, n. 397.) That “then the tares shall be gatheredinto bundles to be burned, and the wheat be gathered into thebarn,” signifies that the evil, according to the genera and species ofthe evil that is with them, are to be gathered up and cast into hell;this takes place with the evil when they are cast out, and is meantby “gathering into bundles”; that the good are to be preserved ismeant by “gathering the wheat into the barn,” the “barn” meaning where the good are collected.

When the good are separated from the evil, which is done by the Lord by means of a moderate influx of His Divine, and by a looking into those things that are of spiritual affection with angels and spirits, then the Lord causes those who are interiorly and thence also exteriorly good, to turn themselves to Him, and thus to turn themselves away from the evil, and when they so turn themselves they become invisible to the evil; for this is a common thing in the spiritual world, that when anyone turns himself away from another he becomes invisible to him. When this is done the evil are separated from the good, and at the same time from the sanctity that they had simulated in externals; and thus they look towards hell, into which they are presently cast. (Concerning this turning about more may be seen in the work Heaven and Hell, n. 17, 123, 142, 144, 145, 151, 153, 251, 255, 272, 510, 548, 561; that the evil who were able to continue in external worship, or in external piety and sanctity, although not in any internal, were allowed to remain till the last judgment, and no longer, and why, may be seen in the small work on the Last Judgment, n. 59 and 70.) 427a.

This is evident from the signification of “to seal,” as being to distinguish and separate (of which presently); also from the signification of “the servants of God,” as being those who are in truths from good (of which see above, n. 6); also from the signification of “forehead,” as being the good of love. It is from correspondence that “forehead” means the good of love; for all things pertaining to man in the whole body, whether within or without, correspond to heaven, for the universal heaven in the sight of the Lord is as one Man, so arranged as to correspond to each and all the things in man. The whole face, where the organs of sight, smell, hearing, and taste, are situated, corresponds to the affections and the thoughts therefrom in general, the eyes corresponding to the understanding, the nose to perception, the ears to hearkening and obedience, and the taste to the desire to know and be wise; but the forehead corresponds to the good of love, from which all these are, for it forms the highest part of the face, and directly encloses the front and primary part of the brain, which is the seat of man’s"

(Respecting this see in the work Heaven and Hell, n. 145, 151; and that the universal heaven in its whole complex answers to one man, n. 68–86; and that there is thence a correspondence of all things of heaven with all things of man, n. 87–102.) This makes clear the signification of “being sealed on the forehead,” namely, to be in the good of love to the Lord from the Lord, and thereby to be distinguished and separated from those who are not in that love; for the Lord looks upon such in the forehead, and fills them with the good of love, from which they look to the Lord by thought from affection. The rest cannot be looked upon by the Lord in the forehead, for they turn away from Him and turn themselves to the opposite love, by which they are filled and attracted. (That everyone in the spiritual world, and man as well in respect to his spirit, turns the face to the ruling love, see in the work Heaven and Hell, n. 17, 123, 142–144, 153, 552.) [2] “To be sealed” means not to be sealed, but to be reduced to such a state that their quality may be recognized, and that they may thus be conjoined with those who are in a like state and separated from those who are in a dissimilar state. This is signified by “to be sealed,” and by a “sign” in the following passages. In Ezekiel: Jehovah said to the man clothed in linen, Pass through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and mark a sign upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and groan over all the abominations done in the midst thereof. And pass ye through the city after him and smite; let not your eye spare, neither have ye pity; but come not near against any man upon whom is the sign (9:4, 6). This also treats of the separation of the good from the evil; and “to mark on the forehead” has a similar signification as in this passage in Revelation, namely, to be distinguished and separated from the evil and to be conjoined to the good; the casting out and"

Those who are in good are described by those “that sigh and groan over all the abominations done in the midst of the city Jerusalem”; “those that sigh and groan over abominations” mean those who are not in evils and in falsities therefrom, “sighing and groaning over them” signifying aversion and grief because of them, “Jerusalem” meaning the church, and “city” the doctrine. Afterwards that they should “pass through the city after him and smite, and the eye should not spare,” describes the casting out and damnation of the evil; “to smite and kill” signifying damnation, for spiritual death, which is damnation, is signified in the Word by natural death. [3] In Isaiah: He shall come for bringing together all nations and tongues, that they may come and see My glory. And I will set a sign upon them (66:18, 19). This is said of the Lord, and of a new church to be established by Him, and thus of a new heaven and a new earth (as is evident from verse 22 of that chapter). “Bringing together all nations and tongues” has a similar signification, as: Gathering together the elect from the four winds (Matt. 24:31); “to gather together” signifies to receive to Himself those who are His own; “nations” signify those who are in good, and “tongues” those who are in a life according to doctrine; “to come and see the glory of the Lord” signifies to be illustrated by Divine truth, and thus to enjoy heavenly joy; for “the glory of the Lord” signifies Divine truth, and illustration and joy from it; “to set a sign upon them” signifies to distinguish and separate them from the evil and conjoin them to the good. [4] It is written of Cain: That Jehovah set a sign upon him that no one might slay him (Gen. 4:15)."

The spiritual arcanum in the history of Cain and Abel is this: “Abel” represents the good of charity, and “Cain” the truth of faith, and that good and that truth are called in the Word “brethren”; and the truth of faith is called “the firstborn” because the truths that are afterwards to become truths of faith are first acquired and stored up in the memory, that from it, as from a storehouse, good may draw what it may conjoin to itself and make the truths to be truths of faith. For truth does not become of faith until man wills it and does it; but so far as man does this the Lord conjoins him to Himself and to heaven, and from love flows in with good, and through good into the truths that the man has acquired from childhood, and conjoins them to good and makes them to be truths of faith; before this they are nothing but the cognitions and knowledges, in which as yet man has no other faith than such as he has in things heard from another, from which he can withdraw if he afterwards thinks differently; therefore this faith is not his own but that of another in him; and yet if a man’s faith is to remain with him after death it must be his own faith; and it becomes his own when he sees, wills, and does what he believes, for it then enters into the man and forms his spirit, and comes to be of his affection and thought; for man’s spirit in its essence is nothing but his affection and thought. [5] That which is of the affection is called good, and that which is of the thought therefrom is called truth; and man believes nothing to be true except what is of his affection, but of the interior affection that pertains to his spirit; consequently that which a man thinks from interior affection is his faith, and whatever other things he holds in his memory, whether he has drawn them from the Word or from the doctrine of the church, by reading or from preachings, or from his own understanding, are not faith, however"

This first-begotten and primary thing is what “Cain” represents and signifies in this history, for Cain was the first- begotten. When this, and not willing and doing the truth, that is, living according to it, is believed to be the faith that saves man, then there springs up a pernicious heresy that faith alone saves, whatever the life may be, and that there may be faith apart from the life; and yet this is not faith, but mere knowledge residing outside of man in his memory, and not within him in the life. If this is called faith it is historical faith, which is having in oneself another’s faith, and such a faith does not receive life until the man sees that what he has thus imbibed is true, and this he first sees when he wills and does it. When that heresy prevails, charity, which is the good of life, is destroyed, and at length rejected as not essential to salvation. This was represented by Cain’s slaying his brother Abel; for faith and charity, or the truth of faith and the good of charity, are called in the Word “brethren,” as was said above. [6] That “Jehovah set a sign upon Cain lest he should be slain” signifies that He distinguished him from others and preserved him, because saving faith cannot be given unless historical faith precedes, and this is knowing from others the things of the church and heaven; in a word, it is a knowledge of such things as faith afterwards consists of; for unless man from infancy imbibed truths from the Word, or from the doctrine of the church, or from preachings, he would be empty, and into an empty man no operation could fall, and no influx out of heaven from the Lord could come, for the Lord operates and flows in through good into truths with man, and conjoins these, and thus makes charity and faith to be one. From this can be seen the signification of “Jehovah set a sign upon Cain that no one might slay him, and that whosoever should slay him vengeance should be taken on him sevenfold.” Moreover, those who are in mere historical faith, that is, in a knowledge of such things as constitute faith, who are the persons or which is the faith meant by “Cain,” these are preserved also because they can teach truths from the Word to others, which they do from memory."

And thou shalt put it on a thread of blue; over against the faces of the miter it shall be, that it may be upon Aaron’s forehead, and may be constantly on his forehead, that they6 may have acceptance before Jehovah (Exod. 28:36–38). For Aaron as high priest represented the Lord in relation to the good of Divine love, therefore his garments represented such things as proceed from that love; the miter represented intelligence and wisdom; and the front part of it love, from which are intelligence and wisdom; therefore the plate of pure gold, upon which was engraved “Holiness to Jehovah,” was placed upon a thread of blue; “pure gold” of which the plate was made signifies the good of celestial love; the “blue” of which the thread was made, on which was the plate, signifies the good of spiritual love (spiritual love is the love of truth); “the engraving of a signet” signifies endurance to eternity; “Holiness to Jehovah” signifies the Lord in respect to the Divine Human from which proceeds all the holiness of heaven and the church; these were upon the front of the miter which was upon Aaron’s head, because the “miter” signifies the like as the head, namely Divine wisdom, and the “forehead” the Divine good of love. (That Aaron represented the Lord in relation to the good of love, see Arcana Coelestia, 9806, 9946, 10017; that “blue” signifies the love of truth, n. 9466, 9687, 9833; and the “miter” signifies intelligence and wisdom, n. 9827.) [8] Because the “forehead” signifies the good of love, the sons of Israel were commanded to bind the commandment respecting love to Jehovah upon their foreheads, as is taught in Moses: Thou shalt love Jehovah thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might. And thou shalt bind these words for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall be for frontlets before thine eyes (Deut. 6:5, 8; 11:18; Exod. 13:9, 16)."

That they bound these words upon the hand also represented ultimate things, because the hands are the ultimates of the powers of man’s soul; therefore “upon the forehead and upon the hand” signifies in things first and last, and “first and last” signifies all things (as may be seen above, n. 417). This commandment was so bound because “on it hang the law and the prophets,” that is, the whole Word, consequently all things of heaven and the church: That on this commandment hang the law and the prophets the Lord teaches (Matt. 22:35–38, 40). This also makes clear why kings, in former times and also at present, when crowned, were anointed with oil upon the forehead and upon the hand, and what this signifies; for kings formerly represented the Lord in relation to Divine truth, and because this is received in the good of love that flows in from the Lord, therefore they were anointed upon the forehead and upon the hand, the “oil” also with which they were anointed signifying the good of love. This is why kings in the Word signify those who are in truths from good, and in an abstract sense truths from good (see above, n. 31). From this it can be seen what “a seal upon the forehead” means, as also elsewhere in Revelation (9:4; 14:1; 22:3, 4). [9] But on the contrary, the “forehead” signifies that which is opposite to the good of love, namely, the evil of love, and thus what is hard, obstinate, shameless, and infernal.

The quality itself is determined by the numbers expressed, as here by the “hundred and forty-four thousand,” and afterwards the “twelve thousand” out of every tribe. What is signified by these numbers will be told in the following article. Number signifies the quality of the thing treated of for the reason that the Word is spiritual, and therefore each and every thing that it contains is spiritual, and spiritual things are not numbered or measured, but still they fall into numbers and measures when they come down out of the spiritual world or out of heaven where the angels are into the natural world or upon the"

That the spiritual things of heaven, such as the angels think and speak about, also fall into numbers, has often been shown to me. When they spoke with each other, what they said was determined into pure numbers, which were seen upon paper; and they afterwards said that this was what they had said determined into numbers, and that these numbers in series contained everything they had said; I was also taught what they signified and how they were to be understood; this will be spoken of frequently in what follows.

That this is the signification of “the tribe of Israel” will be seen in the following article. “A hundred and forty-four thousand” signifies all things and all persons, and is predicated of truths from good, because that number arises out of the number twelve, and “twelve” signifies all things and all persons, and is predicated of truths from good; for greater numbers, and those made up of smaller numbers, have a similar signification as the smaller and simple numbers from which they arise by multiplication (on which see Arcana Coelestia, n. 5291, 5335, 5708, 7973).

And yet it is said that they are to be sealed, that they may be introduced by the Lord into heaven and be with Him (as appears in Rev. 14:1, 3, 4). Furthermore, it is known that eleven of the tribes here mentioned were banished from the land of Canaan on account of their idolatries and other abominations; and so too has the whole Jewish nation, the quality of which may be seen in the New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine (n. 248). From this it can be seen that “twelve thousand” does not mean twelve thousand, nor do “tribes” mean the tribes of Israel, but they mean all who are in truths from good, thus all who are of the Lord’s church. This will become still clearer from the significations of each tribe in the spiritual sense; for each tribe signifies some universal or essential of the church, in which those are who are of the church. Moreover, the universal of each has relation to truths from good, and truths are manifold; for all who are in the heavens differ from each other in respect to good, and thence also in respect to truth, since every truth that has life in man or angel is from good and in accordance with good. Furthermore, all who are of the Lord’s church are in truths from good, while those who are in truths and not in good are not of the church; for, as was just said, every truth that has life in man or angel is from good.

Of the measure of its wall it is said: He measured the wall thereof, a hundred and forty-four cubits, which is the measure of a man, that is, of an angel (Rev. 21:17). “The city Jerusalem” here signifies a new church to be established by the Lord, and its doctrine; therefore all things that are mentioned, as the “wall,” the “gates,” and the “foundations,” mean such things as belong to the church, consequently spiritual things; and as the church and its doctrine are here described in the sense of the letter by “the city Jerusalem,” and a city can be measured, therefore the spiritual things of that church are designated by measures expressed in numbers, and its wall by the number “one hundred and forty-four,” or by twelve multiplied into twelve, which number signifies truths from good in the whole complex; for a “wall” signifies truths defending against falsities and evils. That such is the signification of this number is clearly evident from its being said that the measure of a “hundred and forty-four cubits” is “the measure of a man, that is, of an angel.” What this involves cannot be known unless it is known that measure, in the spiritual sense, has a similar signifi cation as number, namely, the quality of the thing treated of; and that “man” signifies the reception of truth from spiritual affection, that is, from good, and intelligence therefrom; “angel” having a similar signification, since a man is an angel when he is in truths from good, and also becomes an angel after death.

And the wall had twelve foundations, and on them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb. And the foundations consisted of twelve kinds of precious stones (Rev. 21:12, 14, 19–21). When it is known that “the New Jerusalem” means a new church, who will not perceive that the number “twelve” so often employed, means the chief and primary constituent of the church?

But the signification of “gates” and of “foundations” will be told when that chapter is explained.

And also twelve stones were set up in the midst of Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests that bare the ark stood (Josh. 4:1–9, 20); “Jordan” in the Word signifying the introduction into the church, and “stones” therefrom and in its midst, the truths of the church through which introduction is effected. So again: Elijah took twelve stones, and built an altar (1 Kings 18:31, 32); “altar” signifying the good of the church, and “stones” its truths. [11] Again: Moses sent twelve thousand of the sons of Israel, with Phinehas as commander, against Midian, and they returned with great spoil, with not a man missing (Num. 31:5, 6, 49)."

The “great spoil” taken from them, has a similar signification as the “raiment, silver, and gold,” which the sons of Israel took from the Egyptians (Exod. 3:22; 12:35, 36), and a similar signification as the “unrighteous mammon” of which they should make to themselves friends (Luke 16:9), namely, the knowledges of truth therefrom, which they hold as doctrine and not in the life. [12] So again: Solomon placed upon twelve oxen the brazen sea that he made (1 Kings 7:25, 44); “the brazen sea” signifying truth from good, the “water” in it, truth, and the “brass” out of which it was made, good; and “twelve oxen” signify all goods and all truths therefrom which serve as a foundation. Therefore also: Solomon made a throne of ivory with six steps to it, and twelve lions standing upon the steps on the one side and on the other (1 Kings 10:18–20). “The throne of Solomon” signified judgment, which is effected by truths from good, and it represented Divine truth from Divine good; “lions” signifying the truths of heaven and of the church in their power, and “twelve” all (see above, n. 253b). [13] Of Ishmael it is said: That he should be blessed and multiplied, and that twelve princes should be born from him (Gen. 17:20; 25:16); for the reason that “Ishmael” signified the external church with all its truths from good. Of Elisha it is said: That Elijah found him plowing with twelve yoke of oxen, and he among the twelve; and that he cast his mantle upon him (1 Kings 19:19)."

It is said below that: There was seen a woman encompassed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars (Rev. 12:1). This was seen because a “woman” signifies the church and “stars” the knowledges of truth: a “crown” the good of these knowledges, and the “head” intelligence. [14] The Lord’s twelve apostles had a similar representation as the twelve tribes of Israel; namely, they collectively represented the church, and each one of them some essential of the church, and for this reason there were twelve of them. 430c. From this it can be seen why it is and what it signifies that the New Jerusalem (which signifies the church and its doctrine) is said: To have twelve gates, and upon the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon which are the names of the twelve tribes of Israel; and that the wall had twelve foundations, and on these the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb (Rev. 21:12, 14); the “twelve angels,” the “twelve tribes,” and the “twelve apostles” here meaning not angels, tribes, and apostles, but all the things of the church. Likewise it is said that: The apostles are to sit upon twelve thrones, and judge the twelve tribes of Israel (Matt. 19:28; Luke 22:30); which does not mean that the apostles are to sit on twelve thrones and judge the twelve tribes of Israel, but that the Lord alone is to"

Each particular here, with the numbers themselves, is significative; “the five thousand men besides women and children,” signify all who are of the church that are in truths from good; the “men” signifying those who are in truths, and the “women and children” those who are in good; “loaves” the goods and “fishes” the truths of the natural man; “eating” spiritual nourishment from the Lord; the “twelve baskets of fragments” the knowledges of truth and good therefrom in all abundance and fullness.

Because “twelve” signifies all things, the Lord said: Thinkest thou that I cannot now beseech My Father and He will cause to stand by Me more than twelve legions of angels? (Matt. 26:53). “Twelve legions of angels” meaning the whole heaven, and “more than these” signifying Divine omnipotence. [17] From this it can now be seen what is signified by “a hundred and forty-four thousand out of every tribe,” namely, all who are in truths from good; and “twelve thousand out of each tribe” all who are in that kind of truth from good which is signified by the tribe named; consequently, that twelve thousand are not meant, nor those who are of the tribes of Judah, Reuben, Gad, Asher, Naphtali, Manasseh, Simeon, Levi, Issachar, Zebulun, Joseph, and Benjamin. Furthermore, it is to be known that all these, or “the hundred and forty-four thousand,” mean those who were taken up into heaven before the last judgment; but those afterward mentioned, from verse 9 to the end of this chapter, mean those that were preserved by the Lord until the last judgment, and were then first taken up into heaven (respecting whom see above, n. 391a, 392a, 394, 397); for those who were in truths from good were all received into heaven before the judgment; but those who were in good, and not as yet in truths, were preserved, and in the meantime instructed and prepared for heaven. These are to be further treated of hereafter. Those who were taken up into heaven before the judgment are meant by those of whom it is said in chapter 14 of Revelation: A Lamb was standing on the Mount Zion, and with Him a hundred and forty-four thousand, having the Father’s name written on their foreheads (verse 1).

It has been shown thus far that “twelve” signifies all things, and that it is predicated of truths from good; it shall now be shown that “the twelve tribes” signify all things of the church, and each tribe some universal and essential of the church. Because a representative church was to be instituted with the sons of Jacob it was provided by the Lord that his sons should be twelve in number, and that significative names should be given to them, and the twelve tribes from these, known by the same names, should signify all things of the church which they represented, and each tribe some universal essential of it. What, then, each tribe signified and represented will be told in what follows. As all things of the church have relation to truths from good, so “the twelve tribes” signify truths from good in the whole complex. They were called “tribes” because the two words in the original or Hebrew tongue rendered “tribe” mean a scepter and a rod; and a “scepter” signifies Divine truth in relation to government, and a “rod” Divine truth in relation to power. [2] Because of this derivation and signification, when the people murmured against Moses and Aaron on account of the government and power exercised over them, it was also commanded that: The princes of all the tribes should lay up their rods in the Tent of meeting, and in the midst of them the rod of Levi with the name of Aaron written upon it, and this blossomed with almonds (Num. 17:3–8). For “rods,” as has been said, have a similar meaning as “tribes,” and ”the rod of Levi, on which was written the name of Aaron,” has a similar signification as “the tribe of Levi” and as “Aaron” as high priest, namely, the good of charity towards the neighbor and the good of love to the Lord; “tribe of Levi” signifying the good of"

[3] Because “the twelve tribes” signified all things of the church, or truths from good in the whole complex: A breastplate was made for Aaron, which was called the Urim and Thummim, composed of twelve precious stones, on which were the names of the twelve tribes, or of the twelve sons of Israel (Exod. 28:15–30; 39:8–21, 29). It is known that through this answers were given from heaven, but from what origin has not heretofore been revealed; it shall therefore be told. All light in the angelic heaven proceeds from the Lord as a sun; therefore that light in its essence is Divine truth, from which the angels have all their intelligence and wisdom, and men also in spiritual things. This light in heaven is modified into various colors, in accordance with the truths from good that are received; for this reason colors, from correspondence, signify in the Word truths from good; and consequently answers were given by means of a resplendence from the colors of the stones in the Urim and Thummim, and then at the same time either by a living voice or by a silent perception corresponding to the resplendence. This makes clear that “the twelve tribes,” whose names were engraved on the stones, have a like signification. (But on this see what is said and shown in Arcana Coelestia, namely, that colors in heaven are from the light there, and that they are modifications and variegations of light in accordance with reception, n. 1042, 1043, 1053, 1624, 3993, 4530, 4742, 4922; thus that they are the appearances of truth from good, and signify such things as belong to intelligence and wisdom, n. 4530, 4677, 4922, 9466; that so far as colors are derived from red they signify good, and so far as they are from white they signify truth, n. 9467; that “stones” in general signify truths, n. 643, 1298, 3720, 6426, 8609, 10376; that “precious stones” signify truths from good; thus “the twelve precious stones” all truths from good in the church and in heaven, n. 9863, 9865, 9868, 9873, 9905; that “the breastplate of judgment” which was upon the ephod, and was called the Urim and Thummim, signifies"

[4] Because truths from good, or good through truths, has all power, so: The names of the twelve tribes were engraved upon the two onyx stones, six names upon each, and they were placed on the two shoulders of the ephod which Aaron wore (Exod. 28:9–14; 39:6, 7). This signified the power of Divine truth from Divine good, and thus the power that those have who receive Divine truth in the good of love; for the “onyx stones” signified truths from the good of love, the “shoulders” power, and “the twelve tribes” all who are in truths from good. (That Divine truth from Divine good, has all power, and that from it those who receive it have power, may be seen above, n. 209, 333, and in the work Heaven and Hell, n. 228–233; that “shoulders” signify power of every kind, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 4931–4937, 9836.) 431b.

[6] In Matthew: Jesus said to the disciples, Verily I say unto you, that ye who have followed Me in the regeneration, when the Son of man shall sit on the throne of His glory ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel (19:28).

This no one can understand unless he knows from the spiritual sense what is meant by “apostles,” by “thrones,” and by “the tribes of Israel.” Who cannot see that the apostles are not to judge, but the Lord alone? For every man is judged according to his life, and no one except the Lord knows the lives of all, the apostles not knowing even the life of a single person. But in the spiritual sense, “the twelve apostles” signify all truths from good; “to sit upon thrones” signifies judgment, and “the twelve tribes of Israel” signify all who are of the church; these words signify, therefore, that the Lord is to judge all from Divine truth, and according to the reception of it in good.

Something wholly different is signified by each one of these things, as is evident merely from this, that “the New Jerusalem” means a new church in respect to doctrine; therefore “angels,” “tribes,” and “apostles” signify such things as belong to that new church, all of which have relation to truth and to good and to their conjunction, consequently to truths from good. (But these things will be seen explained in what follows, but they are briefly explained in the New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine, n. 1.) [8] In David: Jerusalem is builded as a city that is conjoined together; thither the tribes go up, the tribes of Jah, a testimony to Israel, to make confession to the name of Jehovah (Ps. 122:3, 4).

It is said to be “builded as a city,” because a “city” signifies doctrine; the truths of doctrine which thus look to the Lord are signified by “the tribes, the tribes of Jah”; “tribes” signifying truths, and “tribes of Jah” truths from good that are from the Lord; worship therefrom is signified by “making confession to the name of Jehovah.” [9] Because “Israel” signifies the church that is in truths from good, Israel is called in the Word: The tribes of inheritance (Isa. 63:17; Jer. 10:16; 51:19; Ps. 74:2)."

And as “the land of Canaan” signifies the church, and “the twelve tribes” all things of the church, and each tribe some universal and essential of the church, that land was divided among the tribes (Num. 26:5–56; 34:17–28; Josh. 15, et seq.). This, too, is clearly evident in Ezekiel, where a new land is treated of, which signifies a new church to be established by the Lord; and it is foretold and described how it is to be distributed for an inheritance according to the twelve tribes of Israel (47:13, 20); and these tribes are enumerated by name (48:1 to end). Evidently it is not there meant that the twelve tribes of Israel are to inherit the land, or any one tribe there named; for eleven of the tribes were scattered, and mingled with the nations everywhere, and yet it is told what portion of the land the tribe of Dan was to inherit, what Asher, Naphtali, Manasseh, Ephraim, Reuben, Judah, Benjamin, Simeon, Issachar, Zebulun, and Gad; from which it is plain that the “land” there means the church, and “the twelve tribes” all things of the church, and each tribe some universal essential of the church. It is similar with the twelve tribes enumerated in this chapter of Revelation, that “twelve thousand were sealed out of each tribe,” and were saved. That “twelve thousand” here signifies all persons and all things may be seen in the preceding article; but what universal essential of the church is signified by each tribe will be told in what follows.

For the sake of illustration, only the encampment on the east, of the tribes of Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun will now be explained. “The tribe of Judah” signifies the good of love to the Lord, “the tribe of Issachar” the truth of that good, and “the tribe of Zebulun” the marriage of good and truth, which is also called the celestial marriage; so, too, those who dwell in the eastern quarter of heaven are all in the good of love to the Lord and in truths from that good, and thence in the celestial marriage. The other tribes must be viewed in a similar way.

And he took up his prophetic enunciation, and said, How good are thy tents, O Jacob, thy habitations, O Israel! As valleys are they planted, as gardens by the river (Num. 24:1–4, et seq.).

Moreover, the colors of these stones corresponded to the universals signified by the tribes inscribed on them. When anyone knows this, and knows also what the universal is that each tribe signifies, if he is in spiritual illustration he can in some measure perceive what the tribes signify in their sequence, as they are named in the Word; as what they signify in the sequence in which the sons of Jacob were born, in which the order is as follows: Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Dan, Naphtali, Gad, Asher, Issachar, Zebulun, Joseph, Benjamin (Gen. 29; 30; 35:18); what they signify in the sequence given in their journeying into Egypt, in which they are named in the following order: Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Zebulun, Gad, Asher, Joseph, Benjamin, Dan, Naphtali (Gen. 46:9–21); what they signify in the sequence in which they received the blessing of Israel their father, where they are named in the following order: Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Zebulun, Issachar, Dan, Gad, Asher, Naphtali, Joseph, Benjamin (Gen. 49);"

It shall be told in what follows what they signify in the sequence in which they are named in this chapter of Revelation, where they are named in the following order: Judah, Reuben, Gad, Asher, Naphtali, Manasseh, Simeon, Levi, Issachar, Zebulun, Joseph, Benjamin; and Dan and Ephraim are left out or not named. 432. Verse 5. Of the tribe of Judah twelve thousand sealed; of the tribe of Reuben twelve thousand sealed; of the tribe of Gad twelve thousand sealed. 5. “Of the tribe of Judah twelve thousand sealed,” signifies love to the Lord, and that all who are in that love are in heaven, and come into heaven (n. 433); “of the tribe of Reuben twelve thousand sealed,” signifies the light of truth from that good, and that all who are in that light are in heaven and come into heaven (n. 434); “of the tribe of Gad twelve thousand sealed,” signifies the consequent good of life (n. 435, 436). 433a. Verse 5. Of the tribe of Judah twelve thousand sealed, signifies love to the Lord, and that all who are in that love are in heaven, and come into heaven. This is evident from the representation and consequent signification of “Judah” and his tribe, as being love to the Lord (of which presently); also from the signification of “twelve thousand,” as being all persons and all things (of which see above, n. 430), here all who are in that love; also from the signification of the “sealed,” as being those who are"

It follows that those who are in heaven and who come into heaven are meant, for these “were sealed in their foreheads,” that is, separated from the evil; for these are the ones of whom it is said: A Lamb was standing on the Mount Zion, and with Him a hundred and forty-four thousand, having the Father’s name written on their foreheads. These are they who were not defiled with women; for they are virgins, bought from among men, the firstfruits unto God and to the Lamb (Rev. 14:1, 3, 4). “The Mount Zion” signifies the heaven in which there is love to the Lord; for all those signified by “the twelve thousand out of each tribe,” or by “the hundred and forty-four thousand sealed on their foreheads,” are such as acknowledge the Lord and love Him; and for this reason the first tribe named is the tribe of Judah, which tribe signifies love to the Lord; for (as was said above, n. 431c) the representation of heaven is determined by the order in which the tribes are named, and the first name, or the tribe first named, is that from which are derived the determinations and significations of those that follow, with variations. [2] Furthermore, no one is admitted into heaven except by the Lord, for the universal heaven is His, consequently no one is in heaven, or comes to it, unless he acknowledges the Lord and loves Him. To love the Lord is not to love Him in respect to person but to live according to His commandments, as the Lord also teaches in plain words in John: In that day ye shall know that I am in My Father, and ye in Me, and I in you. He that hath My commandments and doeth them, he it is that loveth Me. If anyone loveth Me he will keep My words; and My Father will love him, and We will come unto him and make Our abode with him. He that loveth Me not keepeth not My words (14:20, 21, 23, 24). Those love the Lord who do and keep His commandments and His words, because His commandments and words signify Divine truths, and all Divine truth proceeds from Him, and that which proceeds from Him is Himself; when, therefore, a man is in that"

To love means also to be conjoined, for love is spiritual conjunction, and conjunction is effected by the reception of Divine truth in doctrine and in life. [3] Before showing from the Word that “Judah,” or the tribe named from Judah, signifies love to the Lord, it shall be told what “Judah” signifies in each sense in the Word. In the highest sense “Judah” signifies the Lord in respect to celestial love; in the internal sense the Lord’s celestial kingdom, and the Word; and in the external sense doctrine from the Word belonging to the celestial kingdom. Because in the highest sense the Lord in respect to celestial love is signified, and in the internal sense the celestial kingdom, love to the Lord also is signified, for that is the reciprocal love in man, and reigns in the Lord’s celestial kingdom. There are two kingdoms into which the universal heaven is divided, the celestial kingdom and the spiritual kingdom; the celestial kingdom consists of those who are in love to the Lord, and the spiritual kingdom of those who are in love towards the neighbor; from this can be seen what is meant by celestial love and by spiritual love (on these kingdoms, see in the work Heaven and Hell, n. 20–28). These two kingdoms the Jews and Israelites represented, the Jews the celestial kingdom and the Israelites the spiritual kingdom. Again, “Judah” signifies the Word because the Lord is the Word, and He took on the Human in that tribe that He might be the Word in respect even to the Human, as it is said in John: In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and God was the Word. And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us (1:1, 14). “The Word” signifies the Lord in respect to Divine truth proceeding from His Divine love; consequently those who love the Divine truth that is in the Word by doing it are in the Lord’s love. [4] That “Judah” signifies the Lord in respect to celestial love, and thus love to the Lord, and also the Word, can be seen from the following passages. In Moses:"

The scepter shall not be removed from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and the obedience of the peoples shall be to him.

Here by “Judah” in the spiritual sense the Lord’s celestial kingdom and the Lord Himself in respect to celestial love are described. Celestial love is the Lord’s love received in the celestial kingdom, and spiritual love is the Lord’s love received in the spiritual kingdom. The signification of these words is as follows: “Thy brethren shall praise thee” signifies that the celestial church is eminent above all others; for “the brethren,” or the tribes named from Jacob’s sons, who were Judah’s brethren, signify the church; “thy hand shall be on the neck of thine enemies” signifies that the infernal and devilish crew shall be thrust out and held back, “enemies” meaning those who are from hell; “thy father’s sons shall bow down to thee” signifies the submission of all truths of the church, “to bow down” meaning to submit themselves, and “his father’s sons” all truths of the church; for in those who are in love to the Lord, and thence in the celestial kingdom, all truths of the church are implanted; “Judah is a lion’s whelp” signifies innocence with innate powers; for love to the Lord, viewed in itself, is innocence, and this is signified by “whelp,” and its innate powers are signified by a “lion”; “from the prey, my son, thou art gone up,” signifies the deliverance of many from hell; “he stooped down, he crouched as a lion, and as an old lion,” signifies the good of love and truth therefrom in its power; for “to stoop down,” in reference to a lion, means to put himself into power; “who shall rouse him up?” signifies that this good is safe wherever it is, and that it cannot be moved by the hells. “The scepter shall not be removed from Judah” signifies that power shall not depart from the good of celestial love; “nor a lawgiver from between his feet” signifies, nor shall the truths of the Word disappear from its ultimate sense; “until Shiloh come”"

Thus from each particular in this description it can be seen that “Judah” does not mean Judah, but that it is some preeminently heavenly thing that is thus described. (But the particulars may be seen explained in Arcana Coelestia, n. 6363–6381.) 433b.

Evidently Judah and Israel are not meant, nor Joseph and Ephraim; for it is said that the tribes of Israel scattered among the nations should be gathered together and brought into the land of Canaan, and that David should be their king and prince, and that they were to dwell with him forever. Who does not know that the tribes of Israel could not be gathered, and that David could no more be king over them? Let it be known, then, what is signified in the spiritual sense by “Judah,” by “the sons of Israel,” by “Joseph” and “Ephraim,” and further what by “David,” and by “the land of Canaan.” “Judah,” in the spiritual sense, signifies the Lord’s celestial kingdom; “the sons of Israel” the Lord’s spiritual kingdom; “Joseph” and “Ephraim,” and “the scattered tribes of Israel that are to be gathered together,” mean those who are below these kingdoms, being neither celestial nor spiritual but natural, and yet are in the good of life according to their religious principle. [6] These are meant also by the Lord in John: Other sheep also I have, which are not of this fold; them also must I bring, and they shall hear My voice; and there shall be one flock and one Shepherd (10:16); for these were not in heaven before the Lord’s coming, but were introduced by Him after He had glorified His Human, and for the reason that until then the Divine proceeding could not extend to them. When this is known, and when it is known that “David” means the Lord in respect to Divine truth proceeding from His Divine Human, it can be known what the particulars here mean in series. These things were written upon two sticks, and the two sticks were joined into one stick, because a “stick” (or wood) signifies the good of life, and all conjunction in heaven is effected by means of good and according to it. (That “wood” signifies the good of life see Arcana Coelestia, n. 643, 2784, 3720, 8354.)

Then the envy of Ephraim shall depart, and the adversaries of Judah shall be cut off; Ephraim shall not envy Judah, and Judah shall not distress Ephraim; but they shall fly on the shoulder of the Philistines towards the sea (11:12–14). This is said of the salvation of the Gentiles, which are also signified by “the outcasts of Israel” and “the scattered of Judah,” for it is said that “the Lord shall lift up an ensign for the nations”; “the outcasts of Israel” mean those who are not in truths, but still are in the desire to learn them; and “the scattered of Judah” mean those who are in the good of life, and thereby in love to the Lord; for those who love to do good love the Lord; for the Lord is in such good, since it is from Him. “Ephraim” means the intellectual, here in agreement with the good of love; and that these shall not be at variance with each other is meant by “the envy of Ephraim shall depart”; “Ephraim shall not envy Judah, and Judah shall not distress Ephraim.” That they shall be separated from those who are in faith separate from charity is signified by “they shall fly on the shoulder of the Philistines towards the sea”; “the philistines towards the sea” meaning those who separate faith from charity, that is from the good of life; “the sea” meaning the ultimate of heaven where it comes to an end; and “to fly on the shoulder” meaning to reject, and thus to separate themselves.

This treats of the Lord’s coming and the establishment of the church by Him with those who are in the good of love and in the truths of doctrine therefrom. “The daughter of Zion” and “the daughter of Jerusalem” signify the church with such; “thy King who cometh, just and faithful,” is the Lord, from whom are the good of love and the truth of doctrine; “I will bend Judah for Me, I will fill the bow with Ephraim,” signifies that the church is to be established with such as are in the good of love to the Lord, and in the truths of doctrine therefrom; “Judah” here meaning those who"

Very evidently “Judah” here does not mean the Jewish nation, nor does “Jerusalem” mean Jerusalem; for the Lord’s coming is here treated of, at which time that nation had wholly receded, and afterwards Jerusalem was destroyed; and yet it is said that “Jehovah shall make Judah an heritage for Himself, and His part in the land of holiness, and shall again choose Jerusalem”; therefore “Judah”"

This, too, is said of the Lord; His coming is meant by “Behold upon the mountains the feet of him that proclaimeth good tidings, that publisheth peace!” “To celebrate feasts” and “to render vows” signify to rejoice in His coming and then to worship Him; “Belial shall never more pass through Judah, he is utterly cut off,” signifies that evil shall be no more with them because they are in the Lord. This could not be said of the Jewish nation, but may be said of those who are in love to the Lord; which makes clear that such are meant by “Judah.” [12] In Malachi: Behold I send My messenger, and he shall prepare the way before Me; and the Lord shall suddenly come to His temple.

One who does not know the spiritual sense of the Word might believe that those who were in Tyre and Zidon and in Philistia sold the sons of Judah and Jerusalem to the Grecians; but this is a prophecy in which the nations which are named signify the things of the church.

This treats of the devastation of the former church and of the establishment of a new church by the Lord; the devastation of the former church is described by “In that day I will smite every horse with astonishment, and his rider with madness,” for “horse” signifies the understanding of truth with man, and “the rider” intelligence (see above, n. 355); “the house of Judah” signifies the church with those who are in the good of love to the Lord; of this it is said that the Lord “will open His eye upon it.” That evils from hell and also falsities will be dispersed by such and with such, is signified by “In that day will I make the leaders of Judah like a furnace of fire among wood, and like a torch of fire in a sheaf, that they may devour all the peoples round about, on the right and on the left.” That that church will be safe from the infestation of evils and falsities is signified by “Jerusalem shall dwell in her own place, even in Jerusalem”; and that the Lord will wholly save those who are in love to Him is signified by “Jehovah shall save the tents of Judah first.” [19] In Isaiah: The word of Jehovah respecting Judah and Jerusalem: It shall come to pass in the latter end of days that the mountain of Jehovah shall be firm on the top of the mountains, and shall be lifted up above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it, and many peoples shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah, to the house of the God of Jacob; and He will instruct us of His ways, and we will walk in His paths (2:1–3). This, too, is said of a new church to be established by the Lord; “the mountain of Jehovah that will then be firm on the top of the mountains” means Zion, and signifies the celestial church, and love to the Lord, which those have who are of that church. That this is the primary thing of the church, and that it is to increase and gain strength, is signified by “it shall be on the top of the mountains,"

[20] In the same: Jehovah thy Redeemer, and thy Former from the womb, that establisheth the word of His servant, and performeth the counsel of His messengers, saying to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be inhabited, and to the cities of Judah, Ye shall be built, and I will raise up the waste places thereof (Isa. 44:24, 26). This, too, treats of the Lord’s coming, who is “Jehovah thy Redeemer, and thy Former from the womb”; He is called “Redeemer” because He delivered from hell; and “the Former from the womb” because He regenerates man. A prediction by the prophets respecting Him and respecting the salvation of man is meant by “that establisheth the word of His servant, and performeth the counsel of His messengers”; that those who are of His church will be saved, and will be instructed in the truths of celestial doctrine is meant by “saying to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be inhabited, and to the cities of Judah, Ye shall be built”; “Jerusalem” meaning the church, and “the cities of Judah” the truths of celestial doctrine. That the falsities that destroy the church shall be shaken off is meant by “I will raise up the waste places thereof.” It is not said by the Lord that Jerusalem would be inhabited and the cities of Judah built, but that Jerusalem would be destroyed, which was done as is well known. [21] In the same: And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an Inheri-tor of My mountains; that My chosen may possess it, and My servants dwell there (Isa. 65:9)."

Those who are in charity are called “chosen,” and those who are in truths from the good of love are called “servants,” therefore it is said “that My chosen may possess it, and My servants dwell there.” [22] In Ezekiel: Judah and the land of Israel were thy traders; they traded in thy market with wheats of Minnith and Pannag, and with honey and oil, and balsam (27:17). This was said of Tyre, which signifies the church in respect to the knowledges of truth and good, and thus “Tyre” signifies the knowledges of truth and good belonging to the church; its merchandise and tradings are here treated of, which describe how these knowledges are acquired, here such of them as are acquired from Judah and the land of Israel; and as “Judah” signifies the good of love, and “Israel” the truths from that good, its tradings are said to be with “wheats of Minnith and Pannag, and in honey, and oil, and balsam,” because “wheats of Minnith and Pannag” signify truths and goods of the church of all kinds, “honey” signifies the good of love in the natural man, “oil” the good of love in the spiritual man, and “balsam” truths that are grateful from good (see above, n. 375, where this is more fully explained). From the merchandise mentioned in this chapter, when understood in the spiritual sense, what is signified by the different nations there mentioned becomes very evident, thus what is meant by “Judah” and by “Israel,” for the merchandise indicates the spiritual meaning. 433d. [23] That “Judah” does not mean the Jewish nation can be seen in Ezekiel 48, which treats of a new land that was to be distributed among the twelve tribes of Israel, and these tribes are there named, and what part of the land each one was to possess; and much is there said about the tribe of Judah, and that “the"

It is evident also that the land there mentioned does not mean a land, but a church, and consequently the tribes there mentioned mean such things as pertain to the church, and “Judah” there means the celestial church, or the church that is in love to the Lord, in which therefore, is the sanctuary. [24] The like is meant by “Judah” and “Israel” in David: Judah became His sanctuary, and Israel His domain (Ps. 114:2). “Sanctuary” signifies in the highest sense the Lord Himself, and in a relative sense the worship of Him from the good of love; “Israel” signifies the truth of the church from that good; and because truths from good, that is, good by means of truths, have all power, therefore it is said “Israel became His domain.” Because “Judah” signifies the Lord’s celestial kingdom, and “Israel” the Lord’s spiritual kingdom (as was said above), and the celestial kingdom is what constitutes the priesthood of the Lord in heaven, and the spiritual kingdom the royalty of the Lord (see in the work Heaven and Hell, n. 24, 226), so in the Word the Lord is called a “King,” and in the Gospels: King of the Jews (Matt. 2:2; John 18:33, 37; 19:19); and the Lord as “King of the Jews” means the Lord in respect to Divine truth proceeding from the Divine good of His Divine love; therefore “kings” in the Word signify truths that are from good (see above, n. 31). [25] In Jeremiah: Behold the days are coming that I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man and with the seed of the beast; and in which I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah.

Here, too, “the coming days” mean the Lord’s coming; therefore it is not meant that a new covenant would then be made with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah, but with a new church to be established by the Lord, which is meant by “the house of Israel and the house of Judah,” in the midst of whom the law should be given, and should be written on the heart. Everyone knows that this was not done with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah, for they utterly rejected the covenant with the Lord and likewise do so to this day. “Covenant” signifies conjunction with the Lord through love to Him, from which conjunction there is given the law or Divine truth in them, both in their doctrine and in their life, and this is the law in the midst and written16 on the heart. “To sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man and with the seed of beast” signifies to reform those who are of the new church through truths and goods that are of intelligence and affection, “seed” meaning truth, “man” intelligence, and “beast” the good of affection. That this is the signification of “beast” will be shown in what follows. [26] In Zechariah: Many peoples and numerous nations shall come to seek Jehovah of Hosts in Jerusalem, and to entreat the faces of Jehovah. In those days,17 ten men out of all the tongues of the nations shall take hold of the skirt of a man that is a Jew, saying, We will go with you; for we have heard that God is with you (8:22, 23). One who does not know that a “Jew” means such as are in love to the Lord and in the truths of doctrine therefrom can easily be led to believe that these things are said of the Jews, and of bringing them into the land of Canaan, and that all others who desire to be saved will then take hold of the skirt of their raiment, praying to be allowed to go with them. But when it is known that this is not said of any introduction into the land of Canaan, to Jerusalem there, and that a “Jew” does not mean those who are of that nation, but that “Jerusalem” means a new church to be established by the Lord, and a “Jew” everyone who is in the good of love to the Lord, and"

[27] From this it can be seen how far from the truth those have wandered, who believe that at the end of time the Jews will be converted to the Lord and brought back into the land of Canaan. These believe that “land,” “Jerusalem,” “Israel,” and “Judah” mean in the Word the land of Canaan, the city of Jerusalem, the Israelitish people, and the Jewish nation. Those who have hitherto so believed are excusable, because they have known nothing of the spiritual sense of the Word, and therefore have not known that the “land” signifies the church, “Jerusalem” the church in respect to doctrine, “Israel” those who are of the spiritual church, and “Judah” those who are of the celestial church; also that where bringing them into the land of Canaan is treated of in the prophets, bringing the faithful into heaven and into the church is meant. This also took place when the Lord came into the world, for then all those who had lived in the good of charity and had worshiped God under a human form were brought into heaven; these had been preserved under heaven until the Lord came, and when He had glorified His Human they were brought in. These are the ones meant in many passages in the prophetic Word that treat of the captivity of the sons of Israel and Judah, and their being brought back into their land. In these passages those also are meant who were to be brought into the church, and thence into heaven from the earth after the Lord came, not only where the Christian religion is received but everywhere else. Both of these classes are meant in many passages where Israel, Judah and Jerusalem are mentioned, and their being brought into the land is treated of (as in the following: Isa. 10:21, 22; 11:11, 12; 43:5, 6; 49:10–26; 56:8; 60:4; 61:1–5, 9; Jer. 3:12–20; 16:15, 16; 23:7, 8; 30:2–11; 31:1–14, 23–40; 33:6–18; Ezek. 16:60–62; 20:40–42; 34:11–16; 37:21–28;"

[28] The two following may be taken as examples of passages whereby the Jews have persuaded themselves, and also Christians have come to believe, that the Jewish nation is to return into the land of Canaan, and be saved before others. In Isaiah: Then shall they bring all your brethren out of all nations, an offering unto Jehovah, upon horses, and upon the chariot, and upon covered wagons, and upon mules, and upon swift beasts, to the mountain of My holiness, Jerusalem. As the new heavens and the new earth which I am about to make shall stand before Me, so shall your seed and your name stand (66:20, 22). (What this signifies see above, n. 355c, 405e, where they are explained.) “The new heaven and the new earth” mean the heaven and the church formed of those who were to be saved by the Lord, when He had glorified His Human, as was said above. [29] In the same: I will lift up My hand towards the nations, and elevate My ensign to the peoples, that they may bring thy sons in the bosom, and carry thy daughters upon the shoulder. Kings shall be thy nourishers, and princesses thy sucklers; with the face to the earth shall they bow down to thee, and lick the dust of thy feet (Isa. 49:22, 23). This whole chapter treats of the coming of the Lord and the salvation of those who receive Him, as is clearly evident from verses 6–9 in that chapter; consequently it does not treat of the salvation of the Jews, much less of their restoration to the land of Canaan. That the Jewish nation is not meant in the above passages can be seen from the fact that it was the worst nation and at heart idolatrous, and that it was brought back into the land of Canaan not because of any goodness or righteousness of heart, but because of the promise made to their fathers; also that they had no truths and goods of the church, but only falsities and evils, and that for this reason they were rejected and driven out of the land of Canaan; as can be seen from all those passages in the Word in which that nation is described."

I have said, I will hurl them into the extreme corners, I will make the remembrance of them to cease from man. For they are a nation lost of counsel, neither is there any intelligence in them. Their vine is of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of Gomorrah; their grapes are grapes of gall, their clusters are of bitternesses. Their wine is the poison of dragons, and the cruel gall of asps. Is this not19 laid up in store with Me, sealed up among My treasures? Mine is vengeance and requital (Deut. 32:20–35). This describes what the nature of the church is with the Jews, namely that it is in dire falsities from evil. What the church is with them is meant by “their vine is of the vine of Sodom and of the fields of Gomorrah,” “vine” signifying the church. The falsities from evil that they possess are meant by “their grapes are grapes of gall, their clusters are of bitternesses, their wine is the poison of dragons and the cruel gall of asps”; “grapes” signify the goods of the church, but “grapes of gall” and “clusters of bitternesses” signify evils from dire falsities; their falsities themselves are meant by “their wine is the poison of dragons and the cruel gall of asps”; “wine” signifies truth from the Word, but “the poison of dragons” and “the gall of asps” signify the monstrous falsity that springs from the falsified truths of the Word. In like manner is that nation described in other parts of the Word (as in Deuteronomy, in the book of Judges, and in the prophets, as in Jer. 5:20–31; 7:8–34; 9:2–26; 11:6–17; 13:9–27; 19:1–15; 32:30–35; 44:2–24).

[32] That they had no truths and goods of the church, but only falsities and evils is evident from the Word, where their whoredoms and adulteries are treated of (in Jer. 3:1 to the end; Ezek. 23:1 to the end). “Whoredoms and adulteries” mean in the Word falsifications of truth and adulterations of good (see above, n. 141, 161); consequently the Lord says that they are: An adulterous generation (Matt. 12:39; Mark 8:38); Also that they are full of hypocrisy, iniquity, and uncleanness (Matt. 23:27, 28); Also that they have falsified the Word by their traditions (Matt. 15:1–6; Mark 7:1–14). And in plain words in John: Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and stood not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie he speaketh from his own, for he is a liar and the father thereof (8:44). “A lie” means falsity from evil; “the devil” the extinction of all good; “a murderer” the extinction of all truth; “father” means both those who are from hell and those who lived from that generation back to the earliest times; “to speak from his own” means to speak from what is innate. [33] That thus everything of the church with them was destroyed, and they were therefore rejected, is evident from Isaiah: The Lord Jehovih of Hosts doth take away from Jerusalem and from Judah the stay and the staff, the whole stay of bread and the whole stay21 of water, the mighty one and the man of war, the judge and the prophet, and the diviner and the old man.

The “vineyard” here means the church with that nation; “I expected that it would bring forth grapes, but it brought forth wild grapes,” signifies that with that nation in place of the goods of truth of the church there were the evils of falsity; “to take away its hedge that it may be eaten up, to break down the wall that it may be trampled down,” signifies the destruction of the church in respect to goods and truths, so that evils and falsities rush in, which are “the brier and the bramble” that should come up; “I will command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it” signifies that with them there is no more any reception of truth and good through the Word out of heaven."

[35] The destruction of the church with that nation is also treated of in Isaiah (7:17–19, and following verses), in Jeremiah (1:15), and in many other passages. For this reason that nation was driven out of the land of Canaan, first the Israelitish nation and afterwards the Jewish nation; and this because the land of Canaan signifies the heavenly Canaan, which is heaven and the church. The quality of each of these nations is fully described in the internal sense in Exodus 32 and 33, where the golden calf that they made for themselves is treated of, on account of which Jehovah wished to consume them, and to raise up from Moses another generation (all of which may be seen explained in Arcana Coelestia, n. 10393– 10512, and n. 10523–10557). [36] What the quality of the Jewish nation was is described also in the internal sense of Genesis 38, which treats of their origin, which was from a Canaanitish woman, and from whoredom with a daughter-in-law; for there were three stocks of that nation, one from the Canaanitish woman whom Judah took to himself for a wife, and two from Tamar his daughter-in- law, with whom he lay as with a harlot (for the explanation of which see Arcana Coelestia, n. 4813–4930). [37] What the quality of that nation was is also described by what is said of Judas Iscariot, for he represented the Jewish nation in respect to the church. For the Lord’s twelve disciples represented the church of the Lord in general, and each one of them some universal essential of it, and Judas Iscariot represented it such as it was with the Jews. (Besides the above, see what has been written respecting that nation in Arcana Coelestia, as follows: a representative church was instituted with the Jewish nation, but in that nation itself there was no church, n. 4899, 4912, 6304.)

Their worship viewed in regard to the nation itself, was also idolatrous, being external, without any internal, n. 4281, 4825, 8871, 8882. They worshipped Jehovah only in name, n. 6877, 10559–10561, 10566; and solely because of miracles, n. 4299. Those are mistaken who believe that the Jews are to be converted at the end of the church, and brought back into the land of Canaan, n. 4847, 7051, 8301. Many passages cited from the Word concerning this, which must however be understood according to the internal sense, thus not according to the letter, n. 7051. The Word in respect to the external sense was changed because of that nation, but not in respect to the internal sense, n. 10453, 10461, 10603, 10604. Jehovah appeared to them from Mount Sinai according to their quality, in a consuming fire, in a dense cloud, and in smoke as of a furnace, n. 1861, 6832, 8814, 8819, 9434. The Lord appears to everyone according to his quality, as a vivifying and recreating fire to those who are in good, and as a consuming fire to those who are in evil, n. 934, 1861, 6832, 8814, 8819, 9434, 10551. One origin of this nation was from a Canaanite woman, and the other two from whoredom with a daughter-in-law, n. 1167, 4818, 4820, 4825, 4874, 4899, 4913. These origins signified what their conjunction with the church was, namely, that it was like that with a Canaanite woman and by whoredom with a daughter-in-law, n. 4868, 4874, 4899, 4911, 4913. Of their state in another life, n. 939, 940, 5057. Because that nation, although it was such, represented the church, and the Word was written with that nation and respecting it, therefore Divine celestial things were signified by their names, as by Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Ephraim, Joseph, and the rest; “Judah” in the internal sense signifying the Lord in respect to celestial love, and His celestial kingdom, n. 3654, 3881, 5583, 5603, 5782, 6363. The prophesy of Israel respecting Judah (Gen. 49:8–12), in which the Lord is treated of, explained, n. 6362–6381. The tribe of Judah, and Judea, signify the celestial church, n. 3654, 6364.

The twelve tribes were divided into two kingdoms, that the Jews might represent the celestial kingdom, and the Israelites the spiritual kingdom, n. 8770, 9320. “The seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,” signifies the goods and truths of the church, n. 3373, 10445. 434a. Of the tribe of Reuben twelve thousand sealed, signifies the light of truth from that love, and that all who are in that light are in heaven and come into heaven. This is evident from the signification of “the tribe of Reuben,” as being those who are in the light of truth (of which presently); from the signification of “twelve thousand,” as being all things and all persons (of which above, n. 430), here all who are in the light of truth from the good of love to the Lord, which love is signified by “the tribe of Judah” (as was just shown above, n. 433); also from the signification of “the sealed,” as being those who are in heaven and who come into heaven (of which also above, n. 427a, 433a). It has been said before, that the twelve tribes of Israel represented and thence signify in the Word all things of the church, that each tribe signifies some universal essential of the church, and that “Judah” signifies love to the Lord; but that “Reuben” signifies light from that love will be seen in what follows. [2] “Reuben,” and thence the tribe named from him, signifies in the highest sense the Lord in respect to foresight or foreknowledge; in the internal sense spiritual faith and the understanding of truth; and in the external sense, sight; and as “Reuben” in the internal sense signifies faith and understanding he also signifies the light of truth, for faith exists from the light of truth, and the understanding is illustrated by it; for where there is the light of truth there is understanding and there is faith. [3] “Reuben,” or the tribe of Reuben, has the same signification as “Peter” the apostle; for the twelve apostles in a similar manner as the twelve tribes of Israel, represented all things of the church, and each apostle some universal essential of the church; and as Peter had a similar representation with Reuben, therefore was he the first"

[4] Reuben was the first of the sons of Jacob, and thence the tribe called from him is named in the first place in most passages of the Word, because he was the firstborn; and “firstborn” in the Word signifies truth from good, or what is the same thing, truth in light, and thus faith from charity. For truth and what is of faith appears to man to be first, for it enters by the hearing into the memory and is called forth therefrom into the thought; and that which a man thinks he sees and perceives by interior sight, and that which is first in sight and perception is first, but merely in appearance, not actually. Actually, good is the firstborn, or the first constituent of the church, since truth exists from good, for good forms itself in truths, and by means of truths presents itself to be seen, therefore truth is good in form. This is why truth is said to be from good and faith from charity, for that which is from anything is that thing imaged forth; and [truth] viewed in itself is good formed and born; such therefore is the meaning of “firstborn” in the spiritual sense of the Word. Moreover, with infants the good of innocence is what is first imparted by the Lord, and it is from this that man first becomes a man; and because good is of love, and man does not reflect about his love but about his thought from the memory, and because good has no quality until it is formed into truths, and without quality nothing is perceived, so it is not known that good is first, and is the firstborn; for it is good that is first conceived from the Lord with man, and it is brought forth through truths, in which good is in its own form and effigy. [5] It is to be noted, furthermore, that the truths that man in his infancy and childhood imbibes from the Word and from doctrine therefrom, and from preaching, although they appear as truths, still they are not truths with him, they are only like shells without kernels, or like the form of the body or of the face without soul and life. These do not become truths until they are received in the will, for thus they are first received by the man and begin to live with him; for the will is the man himself, and all good is of the will, and all truth of the understanding therefrom.

[6] It should be known that all light in which truth is seen is from the light of heaven which is from the Lord; the light of heaven is from the Divine good of the Lord’s Divine love; the light of heaven is Divine good in form. In heaven these two are one, and are received by the angels as one, and should be received by man as one that he may have communion with the angels. (But these things may be seen more fully explained in Arcana Coelestia, as follows: When man is regenerating, truth is in the first place and good in the second, not actually but apparently, but when he is regenerated, good is in the first place and truth in the second actually and perceptibly, n. 3324, 3325, 3330, 3336, 3494, 3539, 3548, 3556, 3563, 3570, 3576, 3603, 3701, 4243, 4245, 4247, 4337, 4925, 4926, 4928, 4930, 4977, 5351, 6256, 6269, 6273, 8516, 10110; thus good is the first and the last of regeneration, n. 9337. Since truth appears to be in the first place and good in the second when man is regenerating, or what is the same, when he is becoming a church, because of this appearance it was a matter of controversy among the ancients whether the truth of faith or the good of charity is the firstborn of the church, n. 367, 2435. The good of charity is the firstborn of the church actually, and the truth of faith only apparently, n. 3325, 3494, 4925, 4926, 4928, 4930, 8042, 8080. And the “firstborn” in the Word signifies the first constituent of the church, which has priority and superiority, n. 3325. For this reason the Lord is called “the Firstborn,” because in Him and from Him is all the good of love, of charity, and of faith, n. 3325.) [7] As truth is apparently in the first place, so Reuben was the firstborn, and was named from sight, as is evident in Moses: Leah conceived and bare a son, and she called his name Reuben; for she said, Jehovah hath seen my affliction; for now my man will love me (Gen. 29:32). Although these are historical facts, they nevertheless contain a spiritual sense; for every and each thing that is in the Word is from the spiritual world, because it is from the Lord; when these"

This is why spiritual conception and birth are signified by “Leah conceived and bare a son”; “she called his name Reuben” signifies its quality; “she said, because Jehovah hath seen” signifies in the highest sense foresight, in the internal sense faith, in the interior sense the understanding, and in the external sense sight, here faith from the Lord; “mine affliction” signifies the state of attaining to good; “for now my man will love me” signifies that the good of truth is therefrom. (But this may be seen explained in Arcana Coelestia, n. 3860–3866.) 434b. In the original language Reuben signifies sight, and in the spiritual sense “sight” signifies the understanding of truth and faith, in the highest sense Divine foresight (as can be seen from what is shown respecting the signification of seeing and sight in Arcana Coelestia, as follows: “sight” in the highest sense, which has reference to the Lord, signifies foresight, n. 2807, 2837, 2839, 3686, 3854, 3863, 10428; “sight” in the internal sense signifies faith, because spiritual sight is sight from faith, and the things that pertain to faith are the objects of sight in the spiritual world, n. 897, 2325, 2807, 3863, 3869, 5400, 10705; also “to see” signifies to understand and perceive truth, n. 2150, 2325, 2807, 3764, 3863, 3869, 10705; the internal sight is the understanding, and this sees through the eyes of the body; and the sight of the understanding is from the light of heaven, n. 1524, 3138, 3167, 4408, 5114, 6608, 8707, 9128, 9399, 10569). [8] That “Reuben” signifies truth from good, or faith from charity, is evident also from the “mandrakes” that he found in the field and gave to his mother, respecting which it is thus written in Moses: Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them unto Leah his mother. And Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray, of thy son’s mandrakes. And she said unto her, Is it a small matter that thou hast taken away my man? and wilt thou"

And Jacob came from the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, Thou shalt come in unto me; because hiring I have hired thee with my son’s mandrakes. And he lay with her that night. And she conceived, and bare Jacob a son, Issachar (Gen. 30:14–18). One who does not know what is signified by “mandrakes,” also what was represented by “Reuben,” “Jacob,” “Leah,” and “Rachel,” must be wholly ignorant of why such things occurred, and why they have been recorded in the Word; but it can be seen that there is something Divine in them that is not apparent in the sense of the letter, because they are in the Word, and in it each and every thing is Divine. The spiritual sense of these things makes evident the Divine that is contained in them; in that sense “mandrakes” signify the marriage of good and truth; “Reuben” represents truth from good; “Jacob” the church in respect to truth; “Leah” and “Rachel” the church in respect to good, but “Leah” the external church, and “Rachel” the internal church; therefore the “mandrakes” found by Reuben signify the conjugial (conjugiale) of truth with good; and as that conjugial is between truth and good in the internal or spiritual man, which constitutes the internal church, and yet that truth is first given in the external or natural man, which constitutes the external church, therefore the mandrakes were found by Reuben, who represented truth from good, and were first given to Leah his mother, who represented the external church, but still Leah afterwards gave them to Rachel, who represented the internal church, that Leah might be permitted to lie with Jacob. (But this may be seen more fully explained in Arcana Coelestia, n. 3940–3952.) 434c.

Why inheritances beyond Jordan were given also to the tribe of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh will be told in what follows. [12] The conjunction of these two churches, namely, the external and the internal, which is like the conjunction of the natural and the spiritual man, was represented, and in the spiritual sense is described by: The altar that the sons of Reuben, of Gad, and of Manasseh built beside the Jordan, about which there was a strife between these tribes and the other tribes; but it was said that the altar should be for a witness that although they dwelt beyond Jordan, they nevertheless served Jehovah in common with the rest; therefore they called that altar a witness between us that Jehovah is God (Josh. 22:9 to end)."

[13] That “Reuben” signifies truth in the natural man is evident also from the prophecy of Deborah and Barak in the book of Judges: In the districts of Reuben there was much searching of the heart. Why did you stay among the campfires to hear the whistling for the flocks? In the districts of Reuben there was much searching of heart. Gilead dwelt22 beyond the Jordan (5:15–17). This no one can understand unless he knows what the prophecy treats of, and what is signified by the “districts,” “Reuben,” “the campfires,” “the whistling for the flocks,” and “Gilead.” This treats of the church among the sons of Israel in a state of vastation; and “the districts of Reuben” signify both all truths and all goods that are in the natural man; “the campfires” signify cognitions and knowledges there; “the whistling for the flocks” signify the perceptions and thoughts thereof; and “Gilead” signifies the natural man. When this is known, what these things mean in the spiritual sense becomes evident, namely, that when the church is destroyed the natural man with the things in it is separated from the spiritual man, whereas it ought to be conjoined to it; and when it is conjoined, there are truths there from good, by which truths there is a combat against the falsities from evil, for the natural man must combat against them from the spiritual man. The “searching of the heart” signifies the truths from good, which are in the natural man from the spiritual man, “heart” signifying the good of love, and “the searching of the heart” all things that are determined and arranged in the natural man from good in the spiritual man.

Here “Reuben” means the understanding of the Word illustrated by light from heaven; and because there are a few who receive such illustration it is said of Reuben, “Yet his men shall be a number,” “number” signifying fewness and a few. 434d. [15] That “Reuben” signifies truth from good, or faith from charity, is evident also from the contrary sense, in which he is also mentioned. In that sense “Reuben” signifies truth separate from good, or faith separate from charity; and truth without good is not truth except merely in respect to expression and sound, for it is merely a matter of knowledge, having its seat in the memory of the natural man, thus only in the entrance to man, and not within him in his life. The memory of the natural man is merely an entrance to him, and what is in it does not become truth in him until he wills it and does it; then it first enters and receives life; not till then does the light from heaven flow in and illustrate. It is similar with faith separate from charity, for truth is of faith, and good is of charity. [16] That “Reuben” in the contrary sense signifies faith separate from charity can be seen from his adultery with Bilhah his father’s concubine, which is thus described in Moses: It came to pass while Israel dwelt in the land Ephrath Bethlehem, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father’s concubine; and Israel heard (Gen. 35:22). “Ephrath Bethlehem” signifies the spiritual church, which is in truths from good, or in faith from charity; Reuben’s adultery signifies the rejection of the good of charity from the truths of faith, for truth is profaned when it is not conjoined with its own"

That the adultery committed by Reuben corresponds to faith separate from charity has been made known and testified to me by things heard and seen in the spiritual world, where such a sphere of adultery is perceived to go forth from those who have separated charity from faith in doctrine and life. [17] Because this too was signified by “Reuben,” the birthright was taken away from him by his father and given to Joseph and his sons. That it was taken from Reuben is evident from these words of his father: Reuben my firstborn, thou art my power and the beginning of my might, excelling in eminence and excelling in strength. Light as water, thou shalt not excel, because thou wentest up to thy father’s bed, then profanedst thou it; he went up to my couch (Gen. 49:3, 4). “Reuben my firstborn” signifies faith, which is apparently in the first place, or truth born of good; “thou art my power and the beginning of my might” signifies that thereby good has its potency and truth has its first potency; “excelling in eminence and excelling in strength” signifies that from this is glory and power; “light as water” signifies that it is not so with faith separate from charity; “thou shalt not excel” signifies that such faith has neither glory nor power, “because thou wentest up to thy father’s bed” signifies because the truth of faith separated from the good of charity has a filthy conjunction; “then profanedst thou it” signifies conjunction with the love of self and the world and with evil therefrom, which is a profane conjunction; “he went up to my couch” signifies the contamination of spiritual good in the natural. (This is fully explained in Arcana Coelestia, n. 6341–6350.)

For “Ephraim” in the Word has a similar signification with “Reuben,” namely, the understanding of truth, and truth in the light. It is said “Ephraim and Manasseh shall be the sons of Israel, even as Reuben and Simeon,” because “Reuben” signifies the understanding of truth, and “Simeon” the will of truth, similar with “Ephraim” and “Manasseh.” From this it can now be seen what universal essential of the church is signified in the Word by “Reuben.” 435a.

The good of life from a celestial origin is the good of life that comes from the good of love to the Lord through truths from that good; the good of life is an effect of these. Such good of life is what is here signified by “the tribe of Gad”; therefore it is called “the good of life therefrom,” namely, from the good of love to the Lord, which is signified by “the tribe of Judah,” through truths from that good, which are signified by “the tribe of Reuben.” The good of life from a spiritual origin is the good of life that comes from good of charity towards the neighbor through truths from that good; this good of life is meant by “Manasseh.”"

The three tribes first named, that is, the tribes of Judah, Reuben, and Gad, signify those things that fully constitute celestial good; but the three following tribes, namely, the tribes of Asher, Naphtali, and Manasseh, signify those that fully constitute spiritual good. So it is with the tribes that follow. [3] Moreover, there are three things which fully constitute and form each universal essential, namely, the good of love, the truth from that good, and the good of life therefrom. The good of life is the effect of the other two; for unless there is a third that is brought forth, the two former can have no existence, that is, unless there is the good of life, the good of love and truth from that good can have no existence. These three are like the final cause, the effecting cause, and the effect. The good of love is the final cause, truth from that good is the effecting cause or that through which good is brought into effect, and the good of life is the effect in which the prior causes have existence; and these have no existence unless there is an effect in which they may exist and subsist. Again, these three are like the pulse of the heart, the respiration of the lungs, and the action of the body; these make a one: for if the body does not act, or does not let itself be put in action, as is the case when man dies, the other two cease. It is the same with the good of love, the truth from that good, and the good of life. The good of love is like the heart, and is also meant by “heart” in the Word; truth from that good is like the lungs, and is also meant by “breath” and “soul” in the Word; and the good of life is like the body in which the others act and live. Three like things are in everything that has existence, and when the three exist together there is full formation.

[5] In this passage of Revelation, where the twelve tribes are mentioned, “the tribe of Gad” signifies the good of life, because it follows in order after Judah and Reuben, and “Judah” signifies the good of love, “Reuben” the truth from that good, consequently “Gad” signifies the good of life; for the good of life has existence from the good of love, through truths from that good, the good of life following as the third in order, being the effect of the two former as was said above. 435b. Because the good of life is the good of the natural man, therefore an inheritance was given to the tribe of Gad23 beyond Jordan, together with the tribe of Reuben and the half tribe of Manasseh; for the land that was beyond Jordan signified the external church (as was shown in the article above), and the things that go forth from the natural man belong to the external church. The church itself regarded in itself is in the internal or spiritual man; but the external church is in the external or natural man, yet these must act as a one, like cause and effect. [6] That an inheritance beyond Jordan was given to the tribe of Gad is evident in Moses: To Reuben, Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh an inheritance was given beyond Jordan, which was a place for cattle; and it was given with the condition that they should cross over, armed, with the rest, to take possession of the land of Canaan (Num. 32:1 to the end; 34:14)."

And in Joshua: Moses gave to the sons of Gad that Jazer should be their border, and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the sons of Ammon, even unto Aroer that is before the faces of Rabbah; and from Heshbon unto Ramath of Mispeh, and Betonim (13:24–28). The signification of “Gad” can be seen not only from the passages in the Word where Gad is mentioned, but also from the lands given to that tribe for an inheritance, where these also are mentioned in the Word, as Heshbon, Jazer, Rabbah, Ramath of Mispeh, the brook of Arnon, Chinnereth, the springs of Pisgah, and many other places. What these lands signify in the spiritual sense no one can know unless he knows the signification of “the tribe of Reuben, of Gad, and of the half tribe of Manasseh,” to whom these lands were given for a possession; for they signify such things as are signified by those tribes in a wide and in a restricted sense. [7] As in Jeremiah: Against the sons of Ammon: Hath Israel no sons? Hath he no heir? Why then hath their king inherited Gad, and his people dwelt in the cities thereof? Therefore behold, the days come in which I will cause an alarm of war to be heard against Rabbah of the sons of Ammon; and it shall become a heap of desolation, and her daughters shall be burned with fire, and Israel shall be heir unto them that were his heirs. Howl, O Heshbon, for Ai is devastated; cry out, ye daughters of Rabbah, gird ye with sackcloth; lament, and wander about among the walls, for their king shall go into exile, and his priests and his princes together (49:1–3). Unless one knows what is signified by “Gad” and by “Israel,” he cannot know what is here signified by “the sons of Ammon,” by “Heshbon,” and by “Rabbah”; for Rabbah, Heshbon, and half of the land of Ammon were given to the tribe of Gad for an"

When these things are known, the spiritual sense of these words follows in this series: “Against the sons of Ammon” signifies against the falsifications of truth; “hath Israel no sons? hath he no heir?” signifies, are there in the church no knowledges of truth and good? “Israel” meaning the church, “his sons” truths, and “heir” the good of truth; “why then hath their king inherited Gad, and his people dwelt in the cities thereof?” signifies, why hath truth falsified destroyed the good of life, and also perverted the doctrinals according to which is life? “Behold, the days come, in which I will cause an alarm of war to be heard against Rabbah of the sons of Ammon, and it shall become a heap of desolation,” signifies the destruction of that doctrine, that is, of truth falsified, and the destruction of those who are in it; “and her daughters shall be burned with fire,” signifies that the affections of that doctrine shall become lusts of evil; “and Israel shall be heir unto them that were his heirs,” signifies that the church in respect to goods is to perish; “howl, O Heshbon, for Ai is devastated,” signifies that there is no longer any fructification of truth from good, because the doctrine of truth is destroyed; “cry out, ye daughters of Rabbah, gird ye with sackcloth, lament,” signifies that there are no longer any affections of truth; “and wander about among the walls,” signifies thought and life from falsities; “for their king hath gone into exile,” signifies because truth is no more; “and his priests and his princes together,” signifies that both goods and the truths of good are no more.

The lands that it is said would be given for an inheritance to the tribe of Gad, in Ezekiel (48:27), mean something else; evidently the tribe of Gad is not meant, but such a constituent of the church as is signified by “Gad,” for there was then no tribe of Gad, nor will there be. [8] That “Gad” signifies the good of life from the truths of doctrine is evident from the blessing of that tribe by Moses: To Gad he said, Blessed is he who hath given breadth to Gad; as a lion he dwelleth, and he teareth the arm, yea, the crown of the head, and he seeth the firstfruits for himself; for there is the portion of the hidden lawgiver; whence came the heads of the people; he hath executed the righteousness of Jehovah, and judgments24 with Israel (Deut. 33:20, 21). Here the good of life according to truths from the Word, and the influx of heaven into that good are described by “Gad”; the influx of truth from the Lord into that good is signified by “Blessed is he who hath given breadth to Gad”; “breadth” signifying truth, “Gad” the good of life, and “Blessed” the Lord. To be safe from falsities is signified by “as a lion he dwelleth”; to be nourished by truths external and internal is signified by “he teareth the arm, yea, the crown of the head,” for “the arm” and “the crown of the head” in sacrifices have this signification; that these truths are from things primary is signified by “he seeth the firstfruits for himself”; truths Divine that lie hidden therein are signified by “for there is the portion of the hidden lawgiver”; intelligence therefrom is signified by “whence came the heads of the people”; good works therefrom are signified by “he hath executed the righteousness of Jehovah”; and truths of the church therefrom are signified by “His judgments with Israel.” [9] “Gad” signifies the good of life because he was named from the Hebrew word for “troop” (Gen. 30:10, 11), “gad” in the Hebrew meaning troop, and “troop” in the spiritual sense signifies works; and the good of life consists in doing the goods which are works (respecting which see Arcana Coelestia, n. 3934). In the blessing given by Israel his father it is thus said in Moses:"

What “Gad” here signifies may be seen explained in Arcana Coelestia (n. 6403–6406); also (in n. 6405) what is signified by these words in Isaiah: Ye are they that forsake Jehovah, that forget the mountain of My holiness, that arrange a table for Gad, and fill a drink offering for Meni (65:11). 436. From this it can now be seen what the three tribes first named, “Judah, Reuben, and Gad,” signify in particular, as also what the three signify in the complex; for the names of persons and places in the Word signify things, not only each by itself signifying its own thing, but in the complex they signify the thing in series. The thing in series that is signified by these three names, “Judah, Reuben, and Gad,” is that all who are in love to the Lord, and from that in truths, and through truths in the good of life, are in the inmost or third heaven; for such have the three degrees of life opened; the inmost degree is where love to the Lord has its seat, the middle degree is where truths from that good have their seat, and the ultimate degree is where the good of life has its seat. In every man there are three degrees of life; in those who are in the third heaven the inmost degree is open, for this is opened immediately from the Lord with those who are in love to Him, for through love there is conjunction and thus reception; because of this they are in all truths, which they see in themselves, and by means of these they are in the good of life. (That there are three degrees of life in every angel may be seen in the work Heaven and Hell, n. 33, 34; that the third degree is opened with those who are in the third heaven, n. 208, 209; what the quality of the angels of the third heaven is, n. 24–26, 267, 270, 271.) 437.

And that all these are in the second heaven, and come into that heaven (n. 441). 438. Verse 6. Of the tribe of Asher twelve thousand sealed, signifies charity towards the neighbor, and that all who are in it are in heaven and come into heaven. This is evident from the signification of “the tribe of Asher,” as being the spiritual affection which is charity (of which presently); and from the signification of “twelve thousand sealed,” as being those who are in heaven and who come into heaven (as above, n. 433a). That “the tribe of Asher” signifies love towards the neighbor, which is called charity, will be made clear from what follows, and is also clear from this, that the twelve tribes taken together represented heaven and the church, and therefore signify these in the Word, and that each tribe represented, and thence signifies, some universal essential that is a constituent of heaven and the church. Heaven and the church are constituted, in general, of three universal essentials, namely, love to the Lord, charity towards the neighbor, and the obedience of faith; love to the Lord is signified by the first three tribes, Judah, Reuben, and Gad (as was shown above); charity towards the neighbor is signified by these three tribes, Asher, Naphtali, and Manasseh; while the obedience of faith is signified by the three tribes next named, Simeon, Levi, and Issachar; the conjunction of all of these with the Lord is signified by the last three tribes, Zebulun, Joseph, and Benjamin. This, in brief, is the signification of all these tribes named in this order, for their signification is determined by the order in which they are named (as has been said and shown above, n. 431c, 435a, 436). [2] Furthermore, the “sealed” mean those who have been separated from the evil and received into heaven; and the first three tribes mean those who have been received into the highest or third heaven, in which all are in love to the Lord; the three tribes next named, which are now under consideration, mean those who have been received into the middle or second heaven, in which all are in charity towards the neighbor; while the three tribes that next follow mean those who have been received into the lowest or first heaven, where those are who are in the obedience that is called the"

From all this it can first be seen that this second class of tribes, that is, the three tribes, Asher, Naphtali, and Manasseh, mean those who are in charity towards the neighbor; “the tribe of Asher” meaning charity towards the neighbor; “Naphtali” the regeneration of those who are in that charity, and “Manasseh” their good of life. [3] But what “Asher” signifies in the Lord’s kingdom, that is, in the church, shall first be told. “Asher” signifies the blessedness of spiritual affections, and thence spiritual affection itself; and as spiritual affection is what is called love towards the neighbor or charity, so “Asher” here signifies charity; consequently the “twelve thousand” of that tribe here signify all who are in charity, and are thus in the second or middle heaven. That Asher was so called from what is blessed or from blessedness is evident both from the meaning of the word in Hebrew and also from what was said of him by Leah the wife of Jacob, when he was born, which is the following: Zilpah, Leah’s maidservant, bare Jacob a second son. And Leah said, In my blessedness, for the daughters will call me blessed; and she called his name Asher (Gen. 30:12, 13). “The daughters who should call her blessed” signify the spiritual affections of truth, which constitute the church, from which is every internal blessedness that is heavenly, in which blessedness those are who are in charity towards the neighbor, for charity towards the neighbor is the spiritual affection of truth (as was just said above); and the spiritual affection of truth is to love truth in its essence, that is, to love truth because it is truth; moreover, the neighbor, in the spiritual sense, is nothing else than good and truth, and charity is love for this (as can be seen from what is said and shown in the New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine, on Love towards the Neighbor, which is called Charity, n. 84–107. The rest of the passage may be seen explained in Arcana Coelestia, n. 3936–3939)."

(This is further explained in Arcana Coelestia, n. 6408–6410.) [5] “Asher” has a similar significance in Moses’ blessing, namely, the delight of the affection of truth from the Word; the blessing is this: Of Asher he said, Blessed above sons be Asher; let him be acceptable unto his brethren, and let him dip his foot in oil; thy shoe is iron and brass; and as the days so thy fame (Deut. 33:24, 25). Moses’ blessing of the sons of Israel contains arcana respecting the Word; and “Asher,” who is the one last mentioned there signifies the spiritual affection of truth from the Word; therefore it is said, “Blessed above sons be Asher, let him be acceptable to his brethren,” “sons” signifying truths, and “brethren” the church from truths; and “blessed” and “acceptable” are predicated of the affection of truths. The good of love, from which are the truths of the Word in the sense of the letter, is signified by “dipping his foot in oil”; “foot” signifies truth in ultimates, which is the truth of the sense of the letter of the Word, and “oil” signifies the good of love. That the ultimate of the Word is natural truth and good is signified by “thy shoe is iron and brass”; natural truth is signified by “iron,” and natural good by “brass,” and the ultimate by “shoe.” That the Word is to endure to eternity is signified by “as the days so thy fame.” (That “iron” signifies natural truth, see above, n. 176; that “brass” signifies natural good, n. 70; and that “shoe” signifies the ultimate of the natural, which is the sensual, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 1748, 2162, 6844.)"

The encampments of the sons of Israel in the wilderness represented the arrangements of the angelic societies in the heavens (see above, n. 431c), and there to the north are the dwelling places of those who, from the good of charity, are in the affection of spiritual knowledges. [7] That “Asher” signifies spiritual blessedness, which is blessedness from love and charity, can be seen in Ezekiel, where the new land and the new city are treated of, and that land is distributed as an inheritance among all the tribes of Israel; and to the city twelve gates are assigned, one for each tribe. The inheritance of Asher is there described in chapter 48:1–3, and the gates in these words: The corner towards the sea four thousand and five hundred;25 the gates of the city three; one gate of Gad, one gate of Asher, one gate of Naphtali. Round about eighteen thousand; and the name of the city from that day, Jehovah-is-there (verses 34, 35). The “land” that was to be distributed for an inheritance signifies the church; the “sons of Israel” among whom it was to be distributed, signify all truths from good in the complex that belong to the church; the “city” signifies the doctrine of truth from good of love, therefore it is called Jehovah shammah, or “Jehovah-is- there”; the “gates” signify introductory truths, which are doctrinals; the number “four thousand and five hundred” signifies all truths from good, and “eighteen thousand” all the truths of doctrine encompassing and defending. This makes clear not only that each and all things there mentioned, even to the numbers, signify the things of the church, but also that no tribe of Israel is there meant, each tribe named standing for some universal essential of the church. It is evident, moreover, that “Asher” here signifies the spiritual affection of truth, which makes one with charity towards the neighbor. (That “Asher” signifies eternity in the highest sense,"

Of the tribe Naphtali twelve thousand sealed, signifies regeneration and temptation. This is evident from what is represented and thence signified by “Naphtali” and his tribe, as meaning temptation and the state after it; and as temptations occur for the sake of regeneration, regeneration too is signified by “Naphtali.” (That those who are regenerated undergo temptations see in the New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine, n. 187–201.) That “Naphtali” and thence the tribe named from him, signify temptation and the state after it, and accordingly regeneration, can be seen from the words of Rachel, when Bilhah her handmaid bare him, which are these: And Bilhah, Rachel’s handmaid, conceived again, and bare Jacob a second son. And Rachel said, With wrestlings of God have I wrestled with my sister, and I have prevailed; and she called his name Naphtali (Gen. 30:7, 8). “Wrestlings of God” signify spiritual temptations; and as Rachel represented the internal church, which is spiritual, and Leah the external church, which is natural, Rachel’s wrestling with her sister and prevailing signifies evidently the combat between the spiritual and the natural, since every temptation is a combat between the spiritual man and the natural; for the spiritual man loves and wills the things that are of heaven, since it is in heaven, while the natural man loves and wills the things that are of the world, since it is in the world; consequently the desires of the two are opposite, which gives rise to collision and combat, and this is called temptation. [2] That “Naphtali” signifies temptation and the state after it, and thence regeneration, is further evident from the following passages. From the blessing he received from his father Israel: Naphtali is a hind let loose; giving sayings of elegance (Gen. 49:21)."

(This is more fully explained in Arcana Coelestia, n. 6412–6414.) [3] Again, from the blessing he received from Moses: And of Naphtali he said, O Naphtali, satisfied with the good pleasure and full of the blessing of Jehovah; possess thou the west and the south (Deut. 33:23). This, too, describes the state after temptation, in which man is filled with every good of love and with truths therefrom; for after temptations he is filled with joy, and good bears fruit, and truth is multiplied with him; to be filled with the good of love is meant by “satisfied with the good pleasure of Jehovah”; and to be filled with truths therefrom is signified by “full of the blessing of Jehovah”; the consequent affection of truth and illustration are signified by “possess thou the west and the south,” the affection of truth is signified by “the west,” and illustration by “the south.” It is said “possess thou the west and the south,” because those who are raised up into heaven after having been instructed are carried through the west to the south, that is, through the affection of truth into the light of truth. [4] “Naphtali” has a similar signification in the song of Deborah and Barak, in the book of Judges: Zebulun, a people that devoted their soul to death, and Naphtali upon the heights of the field (5:18). These were the two tribes that fought against Sisera, the captain of the host of Jabin, king of Canaan, and conquered him, the other ten tribes remaining quiet; and this represented the spiritual combat against the evils that infest the church; as is evident also from the prophetic song of Deborah and Barak, of which this is the subject.

Again “Zebulun and Naphtali” together also signify reformation and regeneration by means of temptations (in Isaiah 8:22; 9:1, 2; also in Matthew 4:12–16). [5] In the highest sense however “Zebulun and Naphtali” signify the uniting of the Divine and the Human in the Lord, for the highest sense treats solely of the Lord, in general of the glorification of His Human, and the subjugation of the hells, and the arranging of the heavens by Him. In this sense Zebulun and Naphtali are mentioned in David: They have seen Thy goings, O God; the goings of my God, my King in the midst of the sanctuary. The singers went before, the minstrels after, in the midst of the maidens playing on timbrels. Bless ye God in the assemblies, the Lord from the fountain of Israel. There little Benjamin is set over them, the princes of Judah their company, the princes of Zebulun, the princes of Naphtali.

Those that are fat shall come out of Egypt. Ethiopia shall hasten her hands unto God (Ps. 68:24–31). This treats in the spiritual sense of the coming of the Lord, of the glorification of His Human, of the subjugation of the hells, and the consequent salvation. Celebration of the Lord because of His coming is described in these words: “They have seen Thy goings, O God, the goings of my God, my King, in the sanctuary. The singers went before, the minstrels after, in the midst of the maidens playing on timbrels. Bless ye God in the assemblies, the Lord from the fountain of Israel.” (What the particulars here signify see explained above, n. 340a.)

The subjugation of the hells is signified by “rebuke the wild beast of the reed, the congregation of the mighty, among the calves of the peoples; trampling upon the plates of silver, He hath scattered the peoples, they desire combats”; “the wild beast of the reed and the congregation of the mighty” mean the knowing faculty of the natural man perverting the truths and goods of the church; “the calves of the people” mean the goods of the church; “the plates of silver” mean the truths of the church; “He hath scattered the people, they desire combats,” signifies to pervert truths and reason against them. [6] The subjugation of the hells means the subjugation of the natural man; for evils from hell are in the natural man, for in it, too, are the delights of the love of self and of the world and the knowledges (scientifica) that confirm these delights; and when these delights are regarded as ends and become dominant they are against the goods and truths of the church. That when the natural man has been subjugated it supplies accordant knowledges, and also cognitions of truth and good, is signified by “those that are fat shall come out of Egypt, Ethiopia shall hasten her hands unto God.” “Egypt” meaning the natural man in respect to knowledges, and “Ethiopia” the natural man in respect to cognitions of good and truth. From these few instances the signification of “Naphtali” and his tribe in the Word can be seen, namely, that it signifies in the highest sense the Lord’s own power, by which He subjugated the hells and glorified His Human, in the internal sense temptation and the states after temptation, and in the external sense resistance by the natural man; therefore “Naphtali” signifies also reformation and regeneration, because these are results of temptations. 440a.

It means the good of life because the good of life makes one with the voluntary of the church or of the man of the church, since that which a man wills he does when he can, for doing is nothing but the will acting, as can be seen from the fact that doing stops when the will stops, and doing goes on as long as there is a will; that which the will of a regenerated man does is called the good of life. For this reason, as the voluntary of the church is signified by “Manasseh” and his tribe, so the good of life is also signified. Moreover, the good of life is the outcome of charity towards the neighbor after regeneration, which is signified by “Asher and Naphtali,” like an effect from its cause; for they who are in charity towards the neighbor are regenerated by the Lord, and those who are regenerated are in the good of life, since they act from charity, and all action from charity is good of life. [2] There are two things that constitute the church, namely, the truth of doctrine and the good of life; both of these must be in a man that he may be a man of the church. “Ephraim and Manasseh” represented and thence signify in the Word these two, “Ephraim” the truth of doctrine, and “Manasseh” the good of life. The truth of doctrine is also called the intellectual of the church, and the good of life is called its voluntary; for truth is of the understanding, and good is of the will; for this reason also “Ephraim and Manasseh” signify the intellectual and the voluntary of the church, “Ephraim” its intellectual, and “Manasseh” its voluntary. That these might be represented and thence signified by “Ephraim and Manasseh” they were born to Joseph in the land of Egypt; for “Joseph” signifies the celestial-spiritual, or the spiritual kingdom itself that is adjoined to the celestial kingdom, and “the land of Egypt” signifies the natural; consequently “Manasseh” signifies the good of the will in the natural born of the celestial- spiritual, and “Ephraim” signifies truth of the understanding in the natural, also born from the same. The nativity of these is thus described in Moses: And unto Joseph were born two sons before the year of famine came, whom Asenath the daughter of Potiphera priest of On bare unto him. And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh, For God"

And the name of the second called he Ephraim, For God hath made me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction (Gen. 41:50–52). The meaning of these words in the spiritual sense can be seen in Arcana Coelestia (n. 5347–5356), namely, that the name of the firstborn, “Manasseh,” means the new voluntary in the natural and what is its quality; and the name of the second, “Ephraim,” means the new intellectual in the natural, and what is its quality; or what is the same, “Manasseh” means the good of the new natural man, and “Ephraim” its truth (see n. 5351, 5354). [3] That this is the signification of “Manasseh and Ephraim” can be seen from the fact that they were adopted by Jacob as “Reuben and Simeon,” which is thus described in Moses: And Jacob said unto Joseph, Now thy two sons, born unto thee in the land of Egypt, before I came unto thee into Egypt, they are mine; Ephraim and Manasseh, even as Reuben and Simeon, shall be mine. They shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance (Gen. 48:3, 5, 6). As “Reuben” signifies truth in the understanding, which is the truth of doctrine, and “Simeon” truth in the will, which is the good of life, therefore Jacob says that “Ephraim and Manasseh should be to him as Reuben and Simeon”; consequently “Ephraim” signifies intellectual truth, and “Manasseh” voluntary good. (But this may be seen more fully explained in Arcana Coelestia, n. 6234–6241.) [4] The same can be seen from the blessing of Ephraim and Manasseh by Jacob, then Israel, as follows: Israel blessed Joseph, and said, The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me from then unto this day, the Angel that hath redeemed me from all evil, bless the boys; and in them shall my name be called, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth (Gen. 48:15–16). That here, too, “Ephraim” means intellectual truth, and “Manasseh” voluntary good, both in the natural, may be seen in"

And again, in the blessing of Ephraim and Manasseh by Moses, as follows: Respecting Joseph, In the firstborn of his ox he hath honor, and his horns are the horns of a unicorn; with them he shall push the peoples together to the ends of the earth; and these are the myriads of Ephraim and these the thousands of Manasseh (Deut. 33:17). This may be seen explained above (n. 316d and 336b). 440b. That “Ephraim” signifies the understanding of truth, and “Manasseh” the will of good, both in the natural, can be seen also from the following passages. In Isaiah: In the fury of Jehovah of Hosts is the land darkened, and the people are become as fuel of the fire; a man shall not pity his brother; and if he shall cut down on the right hand he shall still be hungry, and if he shall eat on the left hand they shall not be satisfied; they shall eat every man the flesh of his own arm, Manasseh Ephraim, and Ephraim Manasseh, they together against Judah26 (9:19–21). “Manasseh shall eat Ephraim, and Ephraim Manasseh,” here signifies that every good and truth of the church is to perish, the good through falsity, and the truth through evil, as may be seen above (n. 386b, where the particulars are explained). [5] In David: Gilead is Mine, and Manasseh is Mine, and Ephraim is the strength of My head; Judah is My lawgiver (Ps. 60:7; 108:8). “Manasseh” here signifies the good of the church, “Ephraim” its truth, and “Gilead” the natural; and since truth from good in the natural has Divine power it is said, “Ephraim is the strength of My head.” Divine power is through truth from good in the natural, because the natural is the ultimate into which things interior flow, which are spiritual and celestial, and where they are together and subsist; consequently where they are in fullness, and in this and from this is all Divine operation. For this reason the sense of the letter of the Word, because it is natural, has in it Divine power (respecting which see above, n. 346, and Arcana Coelestia, n. 9836);"

      "text": "APOCALYPSE EXPLAINED 1445 from this it can be seen why Ephraim is said to be “the strength of Jehovah’s head”; Judah is said to be “His lawgiver” because “Judah” signifies internal Divine truth, or the Word in the spiritual sense, and “lawgiver” and “law” have a similar signification. [6] In the same: Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, Thou that leadest Joseph like a flock; Thou that sittest upon the cherubim, shine forth. Before Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh stir up Thy might and come for salvation to us (Ps. 80:1, 2). From the spiritual sense it is clear that these words contain a supplication to the Lord to instruct those who are of the church, and to lead them by truths to good, thus to heaven. The Lord is called “the Shepherd of Israel” because He instructs and leads; it is therefore said, “Thou that leadest Joseph like a flock,” “Joseph” meaning those of the church who are in truths from good; “Thou that sittest upon the cherubim” signifies the Lord above the heavens, whence He sends forth the light that illustrates minds, therefore it is said “shine forth.” That the light of truth may penetrate even to those who are in natural truth and good, thus to the lowest in the church, is signified by “before Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh stir up Thy might”; “Ephraim” meaning those who are in natural truth; natural truth is such truth as the truth of the Word is in the sense of the letter; “Manasseh” means those who are in natural good, which is the delight of doing good and learning truth; “Benjamin” means the conjunctive of truth and good, or the conjoining medium in the natural; “to stir up might” means the penetration of light even to that; “come for salvation to us” means that such may be saved. [7] Because all the good that the natural man has flows in from the Lord through the spiritual, and without that influx there can be no good in the natural, and because “Manasseh” represented and thus signified good in the natural man from a spiritual origin, therefore to that tribe an inheritance was given both beyond or without Jordan and on this side or within Jordan, that is, to half the tribe beyond or without Jordan, and to the other half on this side or within Jordan (see Num. 32:33, 39, 40; Deut. 3:13; Josh."

The land beyond or without Jordan represented and signified the external church, which is with men in the natural man; but the land on this side or within Jordan represented and signified the internal church, which is with men in the spiritual man (on which see above, n. 434c). Again, it is good that constitutes the church, and this good flows in immediately out of the spiritual man into the natural, and without this influx the church is not with man; and this is the reason that to the tribe of Manasseh, by which the good of the church was signified, was given an inheritance both within and without Jordan. That spiritual good flows into natural good immediately, but into natural truth mediately, may be seen in Arcana Coelestia (n. 3314, 3573, 3576, 3616, 3969, 3995, 4563); thus that there is a parallelism between spiritual good and natural good, but not between spiritual truth and natural truth (n. 1831, 1832, 3514, 3564). That “Manasseh” signifies the good of the church, or the good of life, which is the same as the good of the will, can be seen from the representation and consequent signification of “Ephraim,” as being the truth of the church, or the truth of doctrine, which is the same as the truth of the understanding; for these were brethren, and good and truth are called brethren in the Word. (That “Ephraim” signifies the truth of doctrine, and thus the intellectual of the church, may be seen in Arcana Coelestia, n. 5354, where many passages from the Word in which Ephraim is mentioned are cited and explained; see also n. 3969, 6222, 6234, 6238, 6267, 6296.) 441. It has been shown that “the tribe of Asher” signifies charity towards the neighbor, which is the spiritual internal itself of those who are in the second or middle heaven, and that “the tribe of Manasseh” signifies the good of life, which is the spiritual external that flows from their spiritual internal; while temptation, which is signified by “the tribe of Naphtali,” is the uniting medium, for the internal and external are united by means of temptations. This makes clear what these three tribes involve in their order. It is to be known, that there must be with man and with angel, that they may be in heaven, both an internal and an external in accord with each other. It is impossible for anyone to be in only one of these and be in heaven; that is, in the internal only or in the external only; for"

This has been said to make known that “Asher” signifies the internal, and “Manasseh” the corresponding external; as also above, “Judah” signifies the internal, and “Gad” the corresponding external.28 It is similar in everything; therefore in man there is an internal and an external, an internal called his spiritual, and an external called his natural, one conjoining itself with the other by correspondences; therefore of what quality the one is such is the other, and everything that does not make one with the other by correspondences is dissipated and perishes. 442.

Those who are in the third or inmost heaven and who come into that heaven are signified by “Judah, Reuben, and Gad,” these constituting the first class of those sealed; those who are in the second or middle heaven and who come into that heaven are signified by “Asher, Naphtali, and Manasseh,” these, therefore, constituting the second class of those sealed; but those who are in the first or lowest heaven and who come into that heaven are signified by “Simeon, Levi, and Issachar,” these constituting the third class of those sealed. [2] Those belonging to this first or lowest heaven are all obedient in doing the truths and goods that are commanded in the Word or in the doctrine of the church in which they were born, or that they have heard from some master or religious teacher, from whom they have heard that this or that is true and good, and ought to be done. Most of these are not in truths themselves, but in falsities from ignorance, nevertheless these falsities are accepted by the Lord as truths because they have the good of life for their end, and by this the evils that usually cling to falsities are removed (respecting these falsities, and those who are in them, see in the New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine, n. 21). Such, then, are in the lowest or first heaven. But in the second or middle heaven are all such as are in the spiritual affection of knowing and understanding truth and good, and in the affection of doing it; while in the third or inmost heaven are all such as are in love; but these two classes have already been spoken of above. [3] “Simeon” and his tribe signify those who are in obedience, because Simeon, the father of the tribe, was named from the word that means “to hear,” and “to hear” signifies to obey. This can be seen from the words of Leah his mother when she bare him, which are these: And Leah conceived again and bare a son, and said, Because Jehovah hath heard that I was hated He hath therefore given me this one also; and she called his name Simeon (Gen. 29:33)."

Because “Simeon” signifies obedience he also signifies faith, for faith becomes faith in man when he obeys and does the commandments; before this is done the knowledge of such things as man has drawn from the Word, from the doctrine of the church and from preaching, appears as faith, but this is not faith until man does these things; until then it is merely a matter of thought from the memory, in which there is nothing of the will, consequently nothing of the man, for the will is the man himself; it is therefore when a man does this, that is, obeys, that it enters the will, thus the man himself and becomes faith. [4] This faith, which is obedience, is signified also by Peter, when he is called “Simon”; and the faith that is the affection of truth is signified by Peter when he is called “Simon son of Jonah” (as in Matt. 16:17–19, et seq.; Mark 1:16–18, 36; 14:37, 38; Luke 5:3–11; 7:40–43; 22:31–33, et seq.; 24:34; John 1:40–42; 21:15–21). Because “Simeon” in the Hebrew signifies hearing and hearkening, and thence obedience, as was said above, and “the son of Jonah” signifies truth from good, but “Peter” truth itself, Peter is called by the Lord sometimes “Peter,” sometimes “Simon Peter,” and sometimes “Simon son of Jonah.” That these names have such a signification anyone can see from Peter’s having been called by the Lord now “Peter,” now “Simon,” now “son of Jonah,” which was not done without cause or meaning. What was said to him at the time makes clear what is meant; thus when he confessed that the Lord was the Son of God, and in consequence the keys of the kingdom of the heavens were given to him, he is called “Simon son of Jonah” (Matt. 16:17, et seq.) and is also called a rock (petra) , as the Lord Himself often is in the prophets. Again, he is called “Simon son of Jonah” when the Lord said to him, “Lovest thou Me,” and he answered, “I love Thee”; but when he presently turned himself away from the Lord and was indignant because John, who signifies the good of charity, was following Jesus, he is called “Peter” (John 21:15–21), “Peter” here signifying truth without good, or faith separate from charity."

[6] That “Simeon” the son of Jacob, with the tribe named from him, signifies obedience, and truth in the will, and thence faith, can also be seen from the contrary sense, in which he signifies nonobedience, and falsity in the will, and thus faith separate from the will, which is no faith; for most things in the Word have also a contrary sense, in which they signify the opposite things. It is in this sense that Simeon is mentioned by Israel his father in the prophecy respecting his sons, where it is said: Simeon and Levi are brethren; instruments of violence are their swords; into their secret let not my soul come; in their assembly let not my glory be united. For in their anger they slew a man, and in their good pleasure29 they houghed an ox. Accursed be their anger, for it is fierce, and their fury, for it is hard. I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel (Gen. 49:5–7). “Simeon and Levi are brethren” signifies faith separate from charity; “instruments of violence are their swords” signifies that their doctrinals serve to destroy the works of charity, thus charity itself; “into their secret let not my soul come” signifies that spiritual good does not wish to know the evils of their will; “in their assembly let not my glory be united” signifies that spiritual truth does not wish to know the falsities of their thoughts; “for in their anger they slew a man” signifies that they have wholly turned themselves away from truths, and in their aversion have extinguished faith; “and in their good pleasure they houghed an ox” signifies that from their depraved will they have wholly disabled external good which is of charity; “accursed be their anger, for it is fierce” signifies a grievous aversion from good, and"

(For fuller explanation of this see Arcana Coelestia, n. 6351–6361.) [7] The first three sons, Reuben, Simeon, and Levi, were rejected and condemned by their father Israel because that prophecy describes the establishment of the church, and the church is not established by faith separate from charity, but by truth and good from the Lord; for the church, even at that time, had fallen into the error that merely knowing the Word, and saying that it is holy, is the essential of the church, and not life or charity, and that the God of heaven and earth is some other than the Lord. For this reason in that prophecy the three sons born first, Reuben, Simeon, and Levi, were rejected, because “Reuben” there signifies faith alone, “Simeon” faith without charity, and “Levi” the absence of the good of charity; consequently these three in the series signify no church; for when faith alone is assumed as the essential of salvation, charity is immediately rejected and regarded as nonessential and of no value in respect to salvation; and because these three things were signified by these three sons, therefore they were rejected by Israel their father, who signified the church. Moreover, each of these three destroyed the representative of the church, Reuben: By lying with Bilhah, the maidservant and concubine of his father (Gen. 35:22). and Simeon and Levi: By slaying Hamor, his son Shechem, and the whole city, which was the nation descended from Hamor, for no other reason than that Shechem loved their sister Dinah (Gen. 34:1 to the end). This deed signifies in the spiritual sense that these two sons of Jacob, in other words, that constituent of the church which they represented, extinguished the truth and good of the ancient church, which church yet survived in the nation of Hamor; for this deed signifies in the spiritual sense that every truth and good of the"

This, therefore, is what is meant in particular by the words of Israel, “into their secret let not my soul come; in their assembly let not my glory be united; for in their anger they slew a man, and in their good pleasure they houghed an ox”; for “man” (vir) signifies in the Word truth and intelligence, and “ox” moral and natural good. (For fuller explanation of this see Arcana Coelestia, n. 4426–4522.) [8] And for this reason Simeon was passed by in the blessing of Moses (Deut. 33), and instead of him Ephraim and Manasseh are mentioned, by whom the truth and good of the church are signified. But although Simeon and Levi were such, yet elsewhere they signify the faith of charity and charity, “Simeon” the faith of charity, and “Levi” charity. Yea, the tribe of Levi was appointed to the priesthood; for it matters not of what quality the person is who represents, provided he is in external worship according to the laws and statutes; for representation does not regard the person, but only the thing, and nothing is required in the person except the external of worship. (On this see Arcana Coelestia, n. 665, 1097, 1361, 3147, 3670, 3881, 4208, 4281, 4288, 4292, 4309, 4444, 4500, 6304, 7048, 7439, 8588, 8788, 8806, 9229.) For this reason “the tribe of Simeon” in this passage of Revelation and elsewhere in the Word signifies obedience, the faith of charity, the affection of truth, and in general, truth from good, as has been said above. (That “Simeon” and his tribe, when mentioned in a good sense, signify in the highest sense providence, in the internal sense faith in the will, in the interior sense obedience, and in the external sense hearing, may be seen in Arcana Coelestia, n. 3869.) 444a. Of the tribe of Levi twelve thousand sealed, signifies good works. This is evident from the representation and consequent signification of “Levi” and his tribe, as being spiritual love, which is called charity towards the neighbor. “The tribe of Levi” here signifies good works because spiritual love or charity consists in doing things that are good, and these are good works. Charity itself, viewed in itself, is the affection of truth and good, and where that affection is, there is a life according to truths and goods, for there is no affection without a life according to the truths and goods for which there is affection.

These two kinds of affection differ in this, that natural affection has self and the world for an end; thus the truths and goods by which it is affected are loved30 for the sake of reputation, that honors and wealth may be acquired, and then a life according to the doctrinals that have been learned is put on merely from self for the sake of appearance, which is thus a feigned life and inwardly hypocritical; while spiritual affection has the Lord, heaven, and eternal life for an end, and has regard to these in truths and goods; thus it loves truths and goods spiritually. When this affection is with man he loves to think and to will these truths and goods, and consequently to live according to them. To live according to truths and goods is what is meant in the Word by “doing,” and the life itself is meant by “deeds” and “works” which are so often mentioned in the Word; these, therefore, are what were represented and signified by “Levi” and his tribe in the church with the Jews. [2] Because this affection is the very essential of the church, the tribe of Levi was assigned to the priesthood; this, too, is why Levi’s staff in the tent of meeting blossomed with almonds; and this is why no inheritance was given to that tribe as to the other tribes, but among them all. It is known that the tribe of Levi was appointed to the priesthood; for not only was Aaron made high priest, but also his sons after him, and all the Levites were made ministers to them. That Moses and Aaron were of the tribe of Levi may be seen in Exod. 6:20; Num. 18:2; and that the Levites were made ministers to Aaron and his sons, in Moses: The tribe of Levi was taken for the priesthood, to keep the charge of the whole congregation before the tent of meeting, to serve the service of the tabernacle. And the Levites were given to Aaron, and accepted in place of all the firstborn; and further respecting their ministries and functions (Num. 3:1 to the end). [3] The priesthood was given to this tribe because it represented and thence signified love and charity. Love and charity are the spiritual affection of good and truth; since affection is predicated of love in its continuity, for affection is the continuation of love. This, too, is what the priesthood and its ministry signify in the Word, for this affection is the essential of the church, for where it is there the"

This is why the tribe of Levi was appointed to the priesthood. The like is said of the Levites in Ezekiel, where a new land, a new city, and a new temple are treated of (40:46; 43:19; 44:15; 48:11, 12). [4] Because the tribe of Levi represented and thence signified charity in act, thus the goods of charity, which are good works, therefore: The rod of Levi, upon which was written the name of Aaron, when placed in the tent of meeting before the testimony, blossomed with almonds (Num. 17:2–11); “almonds” signifying the goods of charity, since by these all things of the church flourish in man, for when the goods of charity are with man there are also intelligence and faith, for man is then in the affection of understanding what he knows from the Word, and in the will to do according to what he knows. Because the good of charity must be in all things of the church that the church may be in them, and because the affection itself of good and truth, which is charity, is what gives understanding and instruction to all, so not only was the tribe of Levi appointed to the priesthood, but there was no lot and inheritance granted to that tribe like that granted to the other tribes, but was among them all (as is evident in Moses, Num. 35:1 to the end; and in Josh. 21:1 to the end). So it is said in Moses: Therefore no part or inheritance with his brethren fell to Levi; Jehovah Himself is his inheritance (Deut. 10:9).

From this it can be seen that the tribe of Levi was chosen for the priesthood, and an inheritance was given to it among all the tribes, not because that tribe was better than the others, but because it represented charity in act, and good works, which are the effects of all good and truth in man. 444b. [6] That “the tribe of Levi” signifies in the Word the goods of charity, which are good works, can be seen also from the following passages. In Jeremiah: In those days and at that time I will cause a righteous shoot to sprout up unto David; and He shall do judgment and righteousness in the land. In those days shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem31 shall dwell safely; and this is the name whereby He shall be called, Jehovah our righteousness. There shall not be cut off from David a man to sit on the throne of the house of Israel, and from the priests the Levites there shall not be cut off a man from before My faces to offer up the burnt offering and to burn the meal offering, and to do sacrifice all the days. If ye shall have rendered void My covenant of the day and My covenant of the night, My covenant also with David My servant shall become void that he shall not have a son to reign, and with the Levites, the priests My ministers. As the host of the heavens is not numbered, neither the sand of the sea measured,32 so will I multiply the seed of David My servant and the Levites My ministers (33:15–18, 20–22). This treats of the coming of the Lord, who is “the shoot of David,” and who shall be called “Jehovah our Righteousness.” “Judah shall then be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely,” signifies that then those who are in love to the Lord shall be saved; “Israel shall dwell safely” signifying that those who are in charity towards the neighbor shall not be infested by evils and falsities; “there shall not be cut off from David a man to sit upon the throne of the house of Israel” signifies that Divine truth proceeding from the Lord is then to reign"

[7] “If ye shall have rendered void My covenant of the day and My covenant of the night,” signifies if they did not observe the two things, love and faith, that effect conjunction with the Lord; “covenant” meaning conjunction; “covenant of the day” conjunction by love, and “covenant of the night” conjunction by faith; “My covenant also with David My servant shall become void, that he shall not have a son to reign, and with the Levites the priests, My ministers,” signifies that they shall then have neither Divine truth nor Divine good; “Levites, priests, ministers,” are such as are in the good of love to the Lord and in worship therefrom; “as the host of the heavens is not numbered, neither the sand of the sea measured,” signifies the knowledges of truth and good in the spiritual and in the natural man; “host of the heavens” meaning such knowledges in the spiritual man, and “sand of the sea” meaning such knowledges in the natural man; “so will I multiply the seed of David My servant, and the Levites My ministers,” signifies the multiplication of Divine truth, and the fructification of Divine good in those who have conjunction with the Lord; here as elsewhere “the Levites, the priests,” signify those who are in the good of love and charity, and in an abstract sense, that good itself.

What this signifies in the spiritual sense may be seen explained above (n. 242d and33 433b); and that “the sons of Levi” here mean all who are in the good of charity, and thence in the good of faith. This treats of the Lord who was to come; His Divine Human is what is meant by “His temple” to which Jehovah the Lord was to come; that He will purify those who are in the good of charity, and thence in the good of faith, is meant by “He shall purify and purge the sons of Levi.” Evidently the sons of Levi are not meant, for it is said that “He shall then purify and purge them,” and that “the offering of Judah and Jerusalem shall then be sweet unto Jehovah,” and it is known that the Lord did not purify and purge the Levites, and that the offering of Judah and Jerusalem was not sweet to the Lord, for they were utterly opposed to the Lord, and worship by sacrifices and offerings was then abrogated. For “Judah” here means all who are in the good of love to the Lord, and “Jerusalem” the church that is in the truths of doctrine (see above, n. 433). [9] In Moses: Moses said of Levi, Thy Thummim and Thy Urim for Thy holy man, whom thou didst tempt in Massah, with whom thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah; who said to his father and to his mother, I have not seen him;34 and his brethren he did not recognize, and his sons he did not know; they shall keep Thy word and they shall observe Thy covenant. They shall teach Jacob Thy judgments, and Israel Thy law; they shall put incense in Thy nostrils, and whole burnt offering upon Thine altar, and accept the work of his hands; smite through the loins of them that rise against him and of them that hate him, that they rise not again (Deut. 33:8–11). This is in the blessing of the sons of Israel by Moses, which treats of the Word, because this is signified in the representative sense by “Moses”; and “Urim and Thummin” signify the Divine truth shining forth from Divine good, thus the Word; and “Levi” here means the spiritual affection of truth; the “holy man whom they tempted in Massah and at the waters of Meribah” means the Lord in respect to Divine truth, for the “rock” at which that temptation took place signifies the Lord, and the “waters” from it signify"

[10] But as “the sons of Levi” signify the goods and truths of the church, and in general the spiritual affection of truth and good, it is said of them “they shall keep Thy Word, they shall observe Thy covenant; they shall teach Jacob Thy judgments, and Israel Thy law,” which signifies that those who are in the spiritual affection of truth do the Word and teach the goods and truths of the church, for the spiritual affection of truth is what does and teaches, since it is into that affection that the Lord flows, doing the good with man and teaching the truth with him; “the Word” here means Divine truth, and “to keep it” means to do it; “covenant” means conjunction thereby with the Lord; “judgments” mean the truths of doctrine from the Word; the “law” means the good of truth; “Jacob and Israel” mean the church; “to put incense in the nostrils” signifies worship from the truths of doctrine, and “to put whole burnt offering upon the altar” signifies worship from the good of love. The dispersion of falsities by truth is signified by “smiting through the loins of them that rise against him”; and the dispersion of evils by “smiting through the loins of them that hate him, that they rise not again.” This is said of Levi, because Divine truth, which is the Word, can only be with those who are in the spiritual affection of truth. The spiritual affection of truth consists in loving the truth itself, and esteeming it above every good of the world, because through it man has eternal life, and the only means by which eternal life is implanted in man are truths, consequently the Word, for through the Word the Lord teaches truths. The spiritual affection of truth, which is to love truths above every good of the world, is thus described by the Lord in Matthew: The kingdom of the heavens is like unto a man that is a merchant seeking beautiful pearls; who, when he had found one pearl of great price, going away, sold all that he had and bought it (13:45–46);"

[11] That “Levi” signifies love and charity is evident from the words of his mother Leah when she bare him, which are these: Leah conceived again and bare a son, and said, Now this time will my husband (vir) cleave unto me, because I have borne him three sons; therefore she called his name Levi (Gen. 29:34). “She conceived again and bare a son” signifies spiritual conception and birth; “and said, Now this time will my husband (vir) cleave unto me,” signifies spiritual love, that is charity, by which conjunction is effected; “because I have borne him three sons” signifies what is successive; “therefore she called his name Levi” signifies conjunction by love, and its quality. (For a further explanation of this see Arcana Coelestia, n. 3873–3877.) “Levi” means a cleaving, and “to cleave” signifies conjunction by spiritual love. The three sons of Leah born in succession, “Reuben, Simeon, and Levi” signify in series the first and chief essentials of the church, namely, truth in the understanding, truth in the will, and truth in act; the same as the three disciples of the Lord, “Peter, James, and John,” “Peter” signifying truth in the understanding, “James” truth in the will, and “John” truth in act, which is the good of life or the good of charity. In the original tongue Levi means a cleaving, which signifies conjunction through love and charity. (That this is the signification of “cleaving,” see Arcana Coelestia, n. 3875.) [12] That “Levi” in the highest sense signifies the Lord in relation to love and mercy, is evident in Malachi: That ye may know that I have sent this commandment unto you, that My covenant may be with Levi. My covenant with him was of life and peace; which I gave to him in fear, that he might fear Me, therefore because of My name he was dismayed. The law of truth was in his mouth, and perversity was not found in his lips; he walked with Me in peace and uprightness, and did turn many away from iniquity.

Here “Levi” in the highest sense means the Lord in respect to His Divine Human, for it is said of Levi, that “the law of truth was in his mouth, and perversity was not found in his lips,” and that “the priest’s lips they shall seek the law from his mouth, for he is the messenger of Jehovah of Hosts”; therefore “the covenant of Levi” means conjunction with the Lord through love and charity; “the covenant of life and peace” signifies that conjunction; “fear,” which is also predicated of Him, signifies love. “The priest’s lips they shall seek the law from his mouth” signifies that all truth of doctrine is from the Lord, and is with such as are in love to Him. He is called “the messenger of Jehovah” because of the Divine truth that the Lord teaches in the Word and through the Word; “they turned aside out of the way and caused many to stumble in the law, they corrupted the covenant of Levi,” signifies that the church that was among the Israelites perverted the truths of the Word and the goods of life therefrom, and thus destroyed conjunction with the Lord; “way” signifying the truths of doctrine, “law” its goods, and the “covenant of Levi” conjunction with the Lord. From this what is signified in the representative sense by Levi and his tribe can be seen, namely, the good of charity, which is the good of life, also the spiritual affection of good and truth, and in the highest sense, the Lord in relation to spiritual love. 444c. [13] As most things in the Word have also a contrary sense, so has “Levi” and his tribe; and in this sense “Levi” signifies the evil of falsity, which is the opposite of the good of charity; also life apart from charity, consequently no charity towards the neighbor. This is signified by “Levi” in the prophecy of Israel the father respecting his sons: Simeon and Levi are brethren; instruments of violence are their swords; into their secret let not my soul come; unto their assembly let not my glory be united; for in their anger they slew a man, and in their good pleasure they houghed an ox.

[14] Again, the “Levite” in the Lord’s parable of the man wounded by robbers has this contrary signification; and that parable shall here be explained, because it treats of charity towards the neighbor, and because the Lord there spoke from beginning to end by correspondences, which have heretofore been unknown. In Luke: The lawyer wishing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbor? And Jesus continuing said, A certain man was going down from Jerusalem into Jericho, and he fell among robbers, who both stripped him and smote him, and departed leaving him half dead. And by chance a certain priest was going down that way; and seeing him he passed by. And in like manner a Levite, when he was at the place, came and saw and passed by. But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came to him; and when he saw him he was moved with compassion, and coming near he bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and then setting him on his own beast he led him to an inn and took care of him. And on the morrow when he departed he took out two denaries and gave them to the host, and said to him, Take care of him, and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come back again I will repay thee. Which now of these three seems to thee to have been a neighbor unto him that fell among the robbers? He said, He that showed mercy unto him. And Jesus said unto him, Go, and do thou likewise (Luke 10:29–37). This treats of charity towards the neighbor, and of good works by which charity is in its effect and in its fullness. “Jerusalem” here signifies the church where there is true doctrine, and “Jericho” the church where there are knowledges of truth and good; so the “priest” signifies those who have no love to the Lord, and the “Levite” those who have no charity towards the neighbor, such as those were who were in Jerusalem at that time; but the ”Samaritan” signifies the nations that were in the good of charity; the “man going down from Jerusalem to Jericho” signifies those who wished to be instructed in the truths and knowledges of the church; the “robbers among whom he fell” signify those in the perverted church, such as the Jewish church was at that time; “they stripped him and smote him, and left him half dead,” signifies that"

From this it can now be seen what “Levi,” “his tribe,” and “the Levites” signify in each sense. (More respecting what is represented and thence signified by “Levi,” and the tribe named from him, may be seen in Arcana Coelestia, n. 3875–3877, 4497, 4502, 4503, 6352, 10017.) 445.

Because of this, “reward” signifies in the Word that in which heaven and salvation are, that is, in general, love and faith, and thence intelligence and wisdom, for in these are salvation and heaven, and consequently heavenly joy, so far as man does not think about reward. From this the signification of “Issachar” and his tribe can be seen. [2] Here faith is signified, because “the tribe of Simeon” signifies obedience, and “the tribe of Levi” signifies good works, and they who are in good works from obedience are in faith; while such as are in the goods of life from the spiritual affection of truth and good are in charity, and they who are in the goods of life from celestial affection are in love to the Lord. This, too, is the way in which angels are distinguished in the heavens: those who are in the goods of life from a celestial affection are in the inmost or third heaven; those who are in the goods of life from a spiritual affection are in the middle or second heaven; and those who are in good works from obedience are in the lowest or first heaven, and these also are said to have faith, for the things they hear from the sense of the letter of the Word and from preachers they believe according to their apprehension, but they neither see nor perceive whether they are true, therefore their thought about what is to be believed is called faith; for that is properly called faith which is believed without intellectual sight and perception as to its being so, consequently such persons can believe falsity equally with truth. But when what is believed is seen and perceived this is not called faith, but apperception and perception; for the understanding illustrated by the Lord sees, and the will is affected, and action flows from the two. [3] “Issachar” and his tribe here signify faith, because these three tribes, from each of which were twelve thousand sealed, mean all who are in the lowest or first heaven; and they who are in that heaven are said to be in good works from obedience, and in faith."

But those who separate faith from good works, and declare it to be the sole means of salvation, and that they are saved by it howsoever they live, confirming this by their life, such are not in the lowest heaven but are in hell. [4] Those who have regard to reward on account of the good works they do, and thus place merit in works, are meant by “Issachar” in the prophecy of Israel respecting his sons: Issachar is a bony ass couching down between the burdens. And he shall see rest that it is good, and the land that it is pleasant; and he shall bow his shoulder to bear burdens, [and shall be one who serves for hire] (Gen. 49:14, 15). Here “Issachar” signifies reward or recompense on account of works; “a bony ass” signifies the lowest servitude; “couching down between the burdens” signifies life among works; “and he shall see rest that it is good” signifies works of good without recompense full of felicity; “and the land that it is pleasant” signifies that those who are in the Lord’s kingdom are in such felicity; “and he shall bow his shoulder to bear burdens” signifies that they, nevertheless, labor in every work; “and shall be one who serves for hire” signifies with a view to merit.

Of the tribe of Zebulun twelve thousand sealed, signifies the conjunction with the Lord of those who are in the third heaven. This is evident from the representation and consequent signification of “Zebulun” and the tribe named from him, as meaning the conjunction with the Lord of those who are in the third heaven; because “Zebulun” in the Hebrew means cohabitation, and cohabitation signifies in the spiritual sense conjunction, such as exists with those who love each other. Here “Zebulun” signifies the conjunction with the Lord of those who are in the third heaven, because the nine preceding tribes signify all those who are in the heavens and who come into the heavens; and there are three heavens, the inmost, the middle, and the lowest, and no one comes into heaven except those whom the Lord conjoins to Himself; therefore the three tribes last mentioned signify conjunction with the Lord, “the tribe of Zebulun” the conjunction with the Lord of those who are in the third heaven, “the tribe of Joseph” the conjunction with the Lord of those who are in the second heaven, and “the tribe of Benjamin” the conjunction with the Lord of those who are in the lowest heaven. [2] “Zebulun” signifies in the highest sense the union of the Divine Itself and the Divine Human in the Lord, in the internal sense the Lord’s conjunction with heaven and the church; and in particular, the conjunction of good and truth therein, for by this conjunction the conjunction with the Lord of those who are in the three heavens and in the church is effected; for with such the Lord flows in with the good of love and charity, and conjoins that good to the truths that are with them, and thereby conjoins man and angel to Himself. This is what is signified by “cohabitation,” which is the meaning of “Zebulun.” That this is the meaning of “Zebulun” can be seen in Arcana Coelestia (n. 3960, 3961), where the words of Leah his mother when he was born are explained, which are as follows: And Leah conceived, and bare a sixth son to Jacob.

As in the prophecy of Israel respecting his sons: Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the seas; and he shall dwell at a haven of ships; and his side shall be unto Zidon (Gen. 49:13). Here “Zebulun” signifies the conjunction of good and truth, which is called the heavenly marriage; “to dwell at a haven of the sea” signifies the conjunction of things spiritual with natural truths, “seas” meaning knowledges (scientifica), which are natural truths; “to dwell at a haven of ships” signifies the spiritual conjunction with doctrinals from the Word, “ships” meaning doctrinals and knowledges of all kinds; “his side shall be unto Zidon” signifies extension to the knowledges of good and truth from the celestial kingdom. (For further explanation of this see Arcana Coelestia, n. 6382–6386.) [4] The like is meant in the prophecy of Moses respecting the sons of Israel: Of Zebulun he said, Be glad, Zebulun; in thy going out, and Issachar in thy tents. They shall call the peoples unto the mountain; there they shall sacrifice sacrifices of righteousness; for they shall suck the abundance of the seas, and the hidden things of the secret things of the sand (Deut. 33:18, 19). Here, too, “Zebulun” signifies the marriage of good and truth, as may be seen in the preceding article (n. 445), where the prophecy is explained. So again in the prophecy of Deborah and Barak in the book of Judges: Out of Machir shall come down lawgivers, and out of Zebulun they that draw the staff of the scribe. Zebulun was a people that devoted the soul to death, and Naphtali upon the heights of the field. The kings came, they fought, then fought the kings of Canaan in Taanach by the waters of Megiddo; they took no gain of silver.

So here “Out of Machir shall come down lawgivers” signifies that the truths of good shall flow forth from the good of life, for “Machir” has a like signification as “Manasseh,” because Machir was the son of Manasseh (Gen. 50:23; Josh. 13:31); and “lawgivers” signify those who are in the truths of good, and in an abstract sense the truths of good; “and out of Zebulun they that draw the staff of the scribe” signifies intelligence from the conjunction of truth and good, “Zebulun” signifying here, as above, the conjunction of truth and good, and the “staff of the scribe” intelligence. “Zebulun was a people that devoted the soul to death, and Naphtali upon the heights of the field,” signifies combat in the natural man by means of truths from the spiritual man and from its influx and conjunction, “the heights of the field” signifying the interior things that are of the spiritual man, from which the natural man combats; “the kings came, they fought, then fought the kings of Canaan” signifies the falsities of evil against which is combat; “in Taanach by the waters of Megiddo” signifies those falsities and of what quality they are; “they took no gain of silver” signifies that they took and carried away nothing of truth from good, “silver” meaning truth from good; “they fought from heaven, the stars from their courses fought with Sisera” signifies combat by means of the knowledges of truth and good, which are from the Lord through heaven, “stars” meaning such knowledges, and “courses” truths."

In Matthew: Jesus leaving Nazareth, came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the borders of Zebulun and Naphtali; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying, The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the nations; the people sitting in darkness saw a great light; and to those sitting in the region and shadow of death to them did light spring up. From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent ye, for the kingdom of the heavens hath come nigh (4:13–17; Isa. 9:1, 2). In Isaiah this was evidently said respecting the Lord, for it is said “that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet”; therefore “the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, and Galilee of the nations,” signify the establishment of the church with the Gentiles that are in the good of life and that receive truths and are thus in the conjunction of good and truth, and in combat against evils and falsities. That this means the establishment of the church and the reformation of such nations is evident also from its being said “beyond Jordan, Galilee of the nations,” and also “the people sitting in darkness saw a great light, and to those sitting in the region and shadow of death did light spring up.” [6] “Zebulun and Naphtali” signify in the highest sense the union of the Divine Itself and the Lord’s Divine Human by means of temptations admitted into Himself, and victories gained by His own power; as in David, Ps. 68:27–29 (which may be seen explained above, n. 439). Because of this signification of “Zebulun”: The tribe of Judah, together with the tribe of Issachar and the tribe of Zebulun, pitched to the east about the tent of meeting (Num. 2:3–10); for the encampments of the sons of Israel about the tent of meeting represent and thence signify the arrangements of the angelic societies in heaven; and to the east in heaven are those who are in conjunction with the Lord through love to Him; for “the tribe of"

Of the tribe of Joseph twelve thousand sealed, signifies the conjunction with the Lord of those who are in the second heaven. This is evident from the representation and consequent signification of “Joseph” and his tribe, as being the spiritual of the Lord’s kingdom and church; here “Joseph” signifies the conjunction with the Lord of those who are in the second heaven, because “Joseph” signifies the spiritual kingdom of the Lord, and this kingdom constitutes the second heaven. For there are two kingdoms of which heaven consists, the celestial kingdom and the spiritual kingdom; the celestial kingdom consisting of those who are in the third or inmost heaven, and the spiritual kingdom of those who are in the second or middle heaven. The conjunction with the Lord of those who are in this heaven is signified by “Joseph,” because “Joseph” signifies this heaven and because this fourth class of the tribes treats of the conjunction with the Lord of all who are in the heavens and who come into the heavens, and this conjunction is signified by “the tribe of Zebulun,” the first tribe of this class; for the first tribe of each class and series indicates the subject treated of in what follows, and the tribes that follow continue the same subject in general; here, therefore, conjunction. This is why “the tribe of Zebulun” signifies the conjunction with the Lord of those who are in the third heaven, “the tribe of Joseph” the conjunction with the Lord of those who are in the second heaven, and “the tribe of Benjamin” the conjunction with the Lord of those who are in the first heaven. [2] That “Joseph” in the Word represented and thence signifies the Lord in relation to the Divine spiritual, and in a relative sense the spiritual kingdom, can be seen from all that is related and told of him in the Word, both in the histories and prophecies. In the historical Word it is said of Joseph: That he dreamed a dream that eleven sheaves came round about his sheaf, and bowed themselves down to it; also that the sun and the moon and eleven stars bowed themselves down to him (Gen. 37:4–11)."

The Lord’s spiritual kingdom on earth is the spiritual church; this church is what is meant in the internal sense by Jacob and his sons when they were in Egypt. [3] Afterwards by “Joseph” the establishment of a church that was to be represented by the sons of Israel is described; and this also is why Joseph was carried down into Egypt, and obtained dominion over the whole land, and invited thither his father and brethren, and supported them; and so long as he was lord of the land, the land of Egypt represented the spiritual church in the natural, and Jacob and his sons the spiritual church; but the representation of the spiritual church in the natural by Egypt was ended when Moses was born and he began to lead the Israelites out of Egypt. (These things, as they are many and various, are explained in Arcana Coelestia.) [4] The representation of the Lord in relation to the Divine spiritual, and thence the representation of the Lord’s spiritual kingdom, is contained in these words in Moses (which may be seen explained in Arcana Coelestia, n. 5306–5329): And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Shall we find one like this man, in whom the spirit of God is? And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath made thee to know all this, there is no one so intelligent and wise as thou; thou shalt be over my house, and upon thy mouth shall all my people kiss; only in the throne will I be greater than thou. And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt. And Pharaoh took off his ring from upon his hand, and put it upon Joseph’s hand, and clothed him in garments of fine linen, and put a necklace of gold upon his neck; and he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had, and they cried out before him, Bow the knee; and he set him over all the land of Egypt. And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, besides thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt (Gen. 41:38–44)."

[5] Since it is said that “Joseph” in the highest sense represents the Lord in relation to the Divine spiritual, it shall first be told what is meant by the Lord’s Divine spiritual. Heaven is divided into two kingdoms, one of which is called the celestial kingdom, and the other the spiritual kingdom. The Divine Itself proceeding from the Lord makes heaven, and the Divine proceeding from the Lord is Divine good united to Divine truth. All those in heaven who receive more of Divine good than of Divine truth constitute the Lord’s celestial kingdom, while all who receive more of Divine truth than of Divine good constitute the Lord’s spiritual kingdom; therefore the Divine of the Lord that is received by the angels in the Lord’s celestial kingdom is called the Divine celestial, and the Divine of the Lord that is received by the angels in the Lord’s spiritual kingdom is called the Divine spiritual. But it is to be known that the Divine proceeding from the Lord is so called from its reception, and that there are not two Divines, a celestial and a spiritual proceeding; for the Divine good, which from reception is called the Divine celestial, and the Divine truth, which from reception is called the Divine spiritual, proceed so united as to be not two but one. (These things may be seen more fully explained in the work Heaven and Hell, n. 20–28, where the two kingdoms into which the three heavens are divided are treated of; also n. 13, 133, 139, which treat of the Divine proceeding, which is the Divine good united to Divine truth, and that they are two only in the recipients.) [6] That the Lord in relation to the Divine spiritual and thence the spiritual kingdom is signified by “Joseph” can be seen also from the following passages. In the blessing of the sons of Israel by their father: The son of a fruitful one is Joseph, the son of a fruitful one by a fountain; the daughters (she walketh upon a wall), and they shall embitter him and shall shoot at him, the archers shall hate him; and he shall sit in the strength of his bow, and the arms of his hands shall be strengthened by the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob; thence is he the shepherd, the stone of Israel; from the God of thy father, and He shall help thee; and with Shaddai, and He shall bless thee with blessings of heaven from above, with the blessings of the deep that lieth below, with blessings of the breasts and of the womb.

[10] In David: O God, Thou hast with Thine arm redeemed Thy people, the sons of Jacob and of Joseph (Ps. 77:15). “The sons of Jacob and of Joseph” mean those who are in the good of life according to their religious principles; for “Jacob” means in the Word the external church which is with those who are in the good of life; and “Joseph” here means Manasseh and Ephraim, for it is said “Thou hast redeemed the sons of Joseph,” by whom those are meant who are in good and truth in respect to the external man, thus in respect to life. (That Manasseh and Ephraim, the “sons of Joseph,” have this signification, see above, n. 440.) “To redeem them with His arm,” signifies to save them by omnipotence, for those who had been such were saved by the Lord through His coming into the world, and could not have been saved otherwise.

In the spiritual world this so occurs, that those who have been in pride from self-intelligence, and have confirmed themselves from the Word in such things as favor the loves of self and the world, occupy certain tracts and mountains, and make for themselves a semblance of heaven, believing that heaven belongs to them more than to others; but when the time has been fulfilled they are cast out of their places, and those succeed them who are in the good of life according to the truths of doctrine from the Lord. (See respecting this in the small work on the Last Judgment.) This makes clear what is signified in the internal sense by “the house of Jacob shall be heir to their inheritances, and shall be a fire, and the house of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau for stubble.” [12] In Amos: Who play upon the psaltery, and devise for themselves instruments of music like David; who drink out of bowls of wine, and anoint themselves with the firstfruits of the oils, but are not grieved over the breach of Joseph (6:5, 6).

Sound with the trumpet in the new moon, in the fixed time at the day of our feast. For this was a statute of Israel.

How the Lord was received when He came into the world, and how He was tempted and then became Lord of heaven and earth, and subjugated the hells, reduced the heavens to order and established the church is described by the story of Joseph; how He was received and tempted is described by “he was sold for a servant, his foot they hurt with a fetter, and his soul came into iron”; “he was sold for a servant” signifying that the Lord was held in low"

The “house over which he was set” signifies heaven and the church in respect to good, and “possession” heaven and the church in respect to truth. This has a similar signification as the words of the Lord Himself, that all things of the Father are His and all His are the Father’s; and that all power over heaven and earth was given to Him (John 17:10; Matt. 28:18). That the Lord from His Divine withholds the heavens from falsities and keeps them in truths, and thus gives them intelligence and wisdom, is described by “he bound the princes according to his will, and that he might instruct his elders,” “princes” signifying those who are in truths, and “elders” those who are in intelligence and wisdom. That the Lord then established the church on the earth is meant by “then Israel came into Egypt”; “Israel” signifying the church, for the establishment of the church by the Lord was represented by the sons of Israel coming into Egypt, as also by the Lord’s being carried into Egypt when He was an infant (Matt. 2:14, 15; Hos. 11:1). That all things of the church then perished is meant by “Jacob became a sojourner in the land of Ham”; “Jacob” signifying the church with all who are in the good of life, and “the land of Ham” signifying the church destroyed."

[18] In Ezekiel there is a description of a new spiritual church to be established by the Lord, and this church with its doctrine is meant by “the new city, the new temple, and the new earth,” therefore it is said: This is the border unto which ye shall inherit the land, according to the twelve tribes of Israel, to Joseph cords [portions] (47:13). “Joseph” signifies the spiritual church, and “cords” signify conjunction, and preaching from that tribe to the rest, and from the rest to it; and “the twelve tribes of Israel” signify all things of that church. 449a. Of the tribe of Benjamin twelve thousand sealed, signifies the conjunction with the Lord of those who are in the lowest heaven. This is evident from the representation of “Benjamin” and the tribe named from him, as being the spiritual-celestial in the natural man, as “Joseph” represents it in the spiritual. The spiritual-celestial is truth conjoined to good; for truth regarded in itself is spiritual, and good is celestial; therefore by “Benjamin” and his tribe the conjunction of truth and good in the natural is signified, and thus here the conjunction with the Lord of those who are in the lowest heaven; for in the lowest heaven are those who are in natural good"

Those who are in the lowest heaven are either spiritual-natural or celestial-natural; the spiritual-natural there belong to the Lord’s spiritual kingdom, and the celestial-natural to His celestial kingdom, therefore the spiritual-natural communicate with the second heaven where all are spiritual, while the celestial-natural communicate with the third heaven where all are celestial (as was said in the article above). [2] From all this the signification in the Word of “Joseph” and of “Benjamin,” who were brothers, can be seen. As “Benjamin” signifies truth conjoined to good in the natural man, and thus truth conjoined to good in those who are in the lowest heaven, so he was born to Jacob last, and was called by him “son of the right hand,” (Benjamin, in the original, means son of the right hand); also he was born in Bethlehem, and that city signifies truth conjoined to good in the natural. (That he was born in Bethlehem, see Gen. 35:16–19.) He was born the last because the natural, consisting of truth conjoined to good, is the ultimate of the church with man. For with man there are three degrees of life, the inmost, the middle, and the ultimate; in the inmost degree are those who are in the inmost or third heaven, in the middle degree are those who are in the middle or second heaven, and in the ultimate degree are those who are in the lowest or first heaven; so those who are in the inmost degree are called celestial, those who are in the middle are called spiritual, and those who are in the ultimate degree are called either spiritual-natural, or celestial-natural, and the conjunction of these in the ultimate degree is signified by “Benjamin.” (Respecting these three degrees of life in man and angel, see in the work Heaven and Hell, n. 33, 34, 38, 39, 208, 209, 211, 435.) This now is why Benjamin was born the last of the sons of Jacob. [3] He was called “the son of the right hand” because “son” signifies truth, and “right hand” signifies the power of truth from good, and in the spiritual world truth that is from good in the natural man has all power. All the power the spiritual man has is in this, because the effecting cause is in the spiritual man, and the effect is in the natural, and all the power of the effecting cause puts itself forth through the effect. (That all the power of the spiritual man is in the natural, and through the natural, see Arcana Coelestia,"

For this reason he was called “Benjamin,” that is, “the son of the right hand.” And as “Bethlehem” has a like signification, namely, truth conjoined to good in the natural man, David too was born there, and also anointed as king (1 Sam. 16:1–14; 17:12); for David as king represented the Lord in respect to truth from good, and this, too, is signified by “king” (as may be seen above, n. 29, 31, 205). For the same reason the Lord was born in Bethlehem (Matt. 2:1, 5, 6) because He was born a king, and truth conjoined to good was with Him from birth. For every infant is born natural, and the natural, because it is next to the external senses and the world, is first opened, and this with all men is ignorant of truth and desirous of evil; but in the Lord alone the natural had a desire for good and a longing for truth; for the ruling affection in man, which is his soul, is from the father; and with the Lord, the affection or soul from the Father was the Divine Itself, which is the Divine good of the Divine love. [4] Because “Benjamin” and his tribe signify truth conjoined to good in the natural man: His lot in the land of Canaan was between the sons of Judah and the sons of Joseph; Jerusalem also, where the Jebusites then were, fell to that tribe for an inheritance (Josh. 18:11–28); so that the sons of Benjamin dwelt there with the Jews, who afterwards occupied that city. The tribe of Benjamin had its lot among the sons of Joseph, because that tribe represented and thence signified the conjunction of good and truth; for “Judah” signifies the good of the church, and “Joseph” the truth of the church. Jerusalem fell to that tribe because “Jerusalem” signified the church in respect to doctrine and worship, and all doctrine of the church is the doctrine of truth conjoined to good, and all worship is effected according to doctrine through the natural man; for, as was said above, worship is an effect from the effecting cause which is in the spiritual man. 449b.

This was done for hallowing the sabbath because the “sabbath” signifies the union of the Divine and the Divine Human in the Lord, and in a relative sense the conjunction of His Divine Human with heaven and with the church, and in general the conjunction of good and truth (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 8495, 8510, 10356, 10367, 10370, 10374, 10668, 10730). “The cities of Judah, the circuits of Jerusalem, and the land of Benjamin,” signify truths conjoined to good in the natural man; “the cities of Judah” the truths of good; “the circuits of Jerusalem” the truths of doctrine in the natural man, and “the land of Benjamin” their conjunction; for “cities” signify truths, “Judah” the good of the church, “Jerusalem” the doctrine of truth, “circuits” such things as are round about or below, which are the truths of good in the natural man, and “the land of Benjamin” the church in respect to the conjunction of these in the natural man; “from the lowland, from the mountain, and from the south,” signifies good and truth in the natural man from a celestial origin and from a spiritual origin; “lowland” signifying good and truth in the natural man, because in lowlands, that is, below the mountains and hills, those dwell who are in the lowest heaven, and are called celestial-natural and spiritual-natural, as was said above; “mountains” signifying those who are in celestial good, and “south” those who are in spiritual good, and thence in the light of truth; “to bring burnt offering and sacrifice, and meal offering and frankincense,” signifies worship from celestial good and from spiritual good in the natural man; “burnt offering” signifying worship from celestial good; “sacrifice” worship from spiritual good; “meal offering and frankincense” good and the truth of good in the natural man. Such is the signification of these words. Why else should it be said that in hallowing the sabbath they should come “from the cities of Judah, from the circuits of Jerusalem, from the land of Benjamin, from the lowland, the mountain, and the south,” and why not from the whole land of Canaan?"

In that prophecy, Benjamin is the last one treated of, because he signifies the ultimate of the church and of heaven; the ultimate is the natural, in which truth is conjoined to good. [12] Because this is the signification of “Benjamin”: The tribes of Ephraim, Manasseh, and Benjamin pitched in the wilderness about the tent of meeting, on the west side (Num. 2:18–24); and these three tribes signify all who are in natural truth and good, and in the conjunction of these, “Ephraim” signifying truth in the natural man, “Manasseh” good there (as has been shown above), and “Benjamin” the conjunction of these. These tribes pitched on the west side, because in heaven those dwell at the west and at the north who are in the obscurity of good and in the obscurity of truth, thus who are in natural good and truth; but those dwell at the east and at the south in heaven who are in clearness of good and truth. (Respecting this see in the work Heaven and Hell, n. 141–153.) [13] From this it can now be seen what “Benjamin” signifies in the Word, namely, the conjunction of good and truth in the natural man, and its conjunction through good with the spiritual; for all good that is good in the natural man flows in from the spiritual man, that is, through the spiritual man from the Lord. Without such influx there is no good in the natural man; therefore “Benjamin” signifies also the conjunction of the spiritual man with the natural, and “Joseph” the conjunction of the celestial man with the spiritual. 450. Among these twelve tribes, out of each of which twelve thousand are said to have been sealed, the tribe of Dan is not mentioned, but in its stead the tribe of Manasseh.

After these things I saw, and behold a great multitude, signifies all those who are in the good of life according to their religion, in which there are no genuine truths, as is evident from this, that “the twelve thousand sealed” out of each tribe meant those who are of the church in which there are genuine truths; for “the twelve tribes of Israel” mean those who are in genuine goods and truths, and in an abstract sense all goods and truths of the church; therefore these now treated of mean those who are in the good of life according to their religion, in which nevertheless there are no genuine truths. That this is the meaning of “a great multitude” can be seen also from what follows in this chapter, where it is said, “These are they who come out of the great tribulation” (verse 14), which means out of temptations, for those who are in the good of life according to their religion, in which there are no genuine truths, in the other life undergo temptations, by which the falsities of their religion are scattered, and genuine truths implanted in their place (on this more will be said in what follows). From this it can be seen who are meant by “a great multitude” (which is treated of in what follows to the end of the chapter). It is to be known that no one, either within the church where the Word is or outside of that church, is damned who lives a good life according to his religion, for it is not the fault of such that they are ignorant of genuine truths. Moreover, as the good of life holds deep within it the affection of knowing truths, when such come into the other life they easily receive truths and drink them in.

It also signifies that the Lord alone knows this, as is meant by “which no one could number”; for no man and no angel knows the quality of good and truth with another in every series and connection, but only something of it that is apparent in externals; and yet every quality is of infinite extension, for it joins and associates itself with innumerable things that lie concealed within, and that abide without, and that spread out in every direction. All this no one sees but the Lord alone; therefore it is the Lord alone by whom all are arranged and disposed according to their quality, for He sees the quality of everyone, thus what his nature is and what will happen to him to eternity, since the Lord’s sight which is called omniscience, foresight, and providence, is eternal.

[2] Because of this signification of numbering a punishment was inflicted upon David for numbering the people, which is thus described in the second book of Samuel: Again the anger of Jehovah glowed against Israel, and He incited David against them saying, Go, number Israel and Judah. And the king said to Joab, Go now to and fro through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan even to Beersheba, and number ye the people, that I may know the number of the people. Joab dissuaded him, but the king’s word prevailed. And David’s heart smote him after that he had numbered the people; and David said, I have sinned exceedingly in that I have done; but now let, O Jehovah, I beseech thee, the iniquity of Thy servant pass away, for I have done very foolishly. So the prophet Gad was sent to David, announcing to him three punishments, and of these David chose the pestilence, of which seventy thousand died (24:1 to the end). Who does not know that there is no iniquity in numbering a people? Yet here the iniquity was so great that David, on account of it, was threatened with three punishments from which he was to choose one, and of the pestilence which he chose seventy thousand died. But there was a reason for this, namely, that “Israel and Judah” represented, and thence signified, the Lord’s kingdom in the heavens and on the earth, and “to number” signified to know their quality, and to arrange and dispose accordingly, and that this belongs to the Lord alone; which shows that “to number” in the Word has this signification. [3] “To number” has a like meaning in Moses: When thou takest up the sum of the sons of Israel as to the numbering of them, then shall they give every man an expiation for his soul unto Jehovah in numbering them, that there be no plague among them in numbering them (Exod. 30:12).

What “mountain,” “lowland,” “the south,” “the land of Benjamin,” “the circuits of Jerusalem,” and “the cities of Judah,” signify in the spiritual sense may be seen just above (n. 449b, where they are explained). “The flocks shall pass by the hands of him that numbereth them” signifies that there will be interior goods and truths in the church according to their order and quality, for “flocks” signify interior goods and truths; “flocks” meaning lambs, sheep, she-goats, rams, and kids, and these signify interior goods and truths, which are spiritual goods and truths, while “herds,” which consist of calves, bullocks, cows, and oxen, signify exterior"

Encompass Zion and encircle her; number her towers, set your heart to the bulwarks, mark ye well her palaces; that ye may tell the generation following (Ps. 48:11–13). “Mount Zion which shall be glad,” signifies the celestial church, in which are those who are in love to the Lord; “the daughters of Judah who shall exult,” signify the affections of good and truth which those have who are of that church; “because of Thy judgments” signifies because of Divine truths which they have from the Lord; “encompass Zion and encircle her” signifies to embrace the things belonging to that church from love; “to number her towers” signifies to give thought to the higher or interior truths of that church, “to number” meaning to see and give thought to their quality, and “towers” meaning the higher or interior truths; “set your heart to the bulwarks” signifies to love the exterior truths that defend that church against falsities; “mark ye well her palaces” signifies to perceive the goods of truth, for “houses” mean goods, and “palaces” the more noble goods of truth; “that ye may tell the generation following” signifies their permanence to eternity.

In Job: Dost Thou not number39 my steps? (16:16). Doth He not see my ways and number all my steps? (31:4). In Luke: The hairs of your head are all numbered (12:7).

But here, as those who are in the good of life according to their religion are treated of, “tribes” signify the doctrinals of religion that such believe to be truths and goods, and this is what is meant by “tribes” in the Word when such are treated of; while “the tribes of Israel,” which were treated of above mean all who are in the genuine truths and goods of the church, and in an abstract sense those truths and goods. So here, “out of every nation and all tribes” signifies all who are in good in respect to life according to the doctrinals of their religion."

This is evident from the signification of “peoples,” as being those who are in the truths of doctrine, and in a contrary sense those who are in the falsities of doctrine (of which above, n. 175); but here, those who are in the falsities of doctrine from ignorance; for here are treated of those who are saved, although from the doctrine of their religion they have been in falsities. All those who are in the good of life in accordance with the dogmas of their religion, which they have believed to be true although they are not true, are saved, for falsity is not imputed to anyone who lives well according to the dogmas of his religion, because it is not his fault that he is ignorant of truths. For the good of life in accordance with a religion contains within itself the affection of knowing truths, and these truths are learned and accepted when such persons come into the other life, for every affection remains with man after death, and especially the affection of knowing truths, because this is a spiritual affection; and when man becomes a spirit, he is his affection; consequently the truths that are then desired are imbibed and thus received deeply in the heart. (That when a man lives well falsities of religion are accepted by the Lord as truths, see above, n. 452.) The above is evident from the signification of “tongues,” as meaning their confessions from religion, for “tongues” mean speech, and “speech” signifies confession and religion, because the tongue utters and confesses the things that pertain to religion. [2] There is frequent mention in the Word of the “lip,” the “mouth,” and the “tongue”; and the “lip” signifies doctrine, the “mouth” thought, and the “tongue” confession. “Lip,” “mouth,” and “tongue,” have this signification because these are the externals of man, by means of which things internal find expression, and it is things internal that are signified in the internal or spiritual sense. For the Word in the letter consists of external things that are manifest before the eyes and are perceived by the senses, therefore the Word in the letter is natural, and this in order that the Divine truth that it contains may be there in what is ultimate and thus in fullness. But these external things, which are natural, include in themselves things internal that are spiritual, and these therefore are the things that are signified."

In Isaiah: The time shall come for bringing together all nations and tongues, that they may come and see My glory (66:18). This is said of the Lord’s coming; “nations and tongues” signify all who are in the good of life according to their religions; “tongues” signify religions from confessions; it is therefore said “that they may come and see My glory,” “glory” signifying Divine truth, by which the church exists. [4] In Daniel: Behold, with the clouds of the heavens one like the Son of man. And there was given Him dominion and glory and a kingdom, that all peoples, tongues, and nations might worship Him (7:13, 14). “The Son of man who was to come in the clouds of the heavens,” evidently means the Lord, and “the clouds of the heavens” mean the Word in the letter, in which it is said that the Lord is to come, for the Word treats of Him, and in the inmost sense of Him alone. Therefore it is said “Son of man,” because the Lord is called “the Son of man” from Divine truth, which is the Word. But respecting this see more above (n. 36) where these words are explained: Behold, He cometh with the clouds; and every eye shall see Him (Rev. 1:7). The Lord’s power from Divine good is meant by “dominion,” and from Divine truth by “glory,” and heaven and the church are meant by “kingdom.” “Peoples, tongues, and nations,” signify all those who are in doctrine and in a life according to their religions; those who are in doctrine are called “peoples,” those who are in life “nations,” and “tongues” mean religions.

The spiritual sense of these words may be seen above (n. 433d); namely, that a “Jew” means those who are in love to the Lord and in the truths of doctrine from Him; and that “all tongues of the nations” mean those who are of various religions. 455b. [6] “Tongues” have a like signification in the following passages. In Moses: From these were the islands of the nations separated in their lands, every man according to his tongue, according to their families, in their nations. The habitations of the sons of Shem, according to their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations (Gen. 10:5, 31). In Revelation: Thou must prophesy again over many peoples and nations and tongues and kings (10:11). And they of the peoples and tribes and tongues and nations shall see their bodies three days and a half (11:9). And it was given unto the beast to make war with the saints and to overcome them; and there was given him power over every tribe and tongue and nation (13:7). I saw an angel flying in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting Gospel to proclaim unto those that dwell on the earth, and unto every nation and tribe and tongue and people (14:6). The waters which thou sawest, where the harlot sitteth, are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues (17:15). “Waters” here signify the truths of the Word, for “waters” in the Word signify truths, and in the contrary sense falsities; therefore here “peoples, multitudes, nations, and tongues,” mean those who are in truths falsified, which in themselves are falsities, and are consequently in evils of life."

In this parable, as in others, the Lord spake by correspondences, as can be seen by this, that the “rich man” does not mean the rich, nor does “Abraham” mean Abraham, nor by “the water with which Lazarus might cool the tongue” are water and tongue meant, nor does the “flame” mean flame, for in hell no one is tortured by flames; but a “rich man” means those who are of the church where the Word is, from which they have spiritual riches, which are truths of doctrine; so the “rich man” here means the Jews, with whom was the Word at that time; “Abraham” means the Lord; the “water into which Lazarus might dip the tip of his finger” signifies truth from the Word; and “tongue” signifies a thirst and eagerness to pervert the truths that are in the Word; and the “flame” the punishment of that eagerness, which is various and manifold. This makes evident what these things signify in the series, and that “to cool the tongue with water” signifies to allay the thirst and the eagerness to pervert truths, and to confirm falsities thereby. Who cannot see that it does not mean that Lazarus should dip the tip of his finger in water to cool the tongue?

[9] In the book of Judges: Jehovah said unto Gideon, Everyone that lappeth the waters with his tongue as a dog lappeth, him shalt thou set by himself; and everyone that boweth down upon his knees to drink. And the number of them that lapped in their hand were three hundred men; and these were led against Midian and smote him (7:5–7). “Midian” here means those who do not care for truth, because they are merely natural and external; therefore Midian was smitten by those who “lapped the waters in the hand with the tongue like a dog”; these mean such as have an appetite for truths, thus they who from some natural affection seek to know truths, a “dog” signifying appetite and eagerness, “waters” truths, and “lapping them with the tongue” to have an appetite for and eagerly seek. So it was by these that Midian was smitten. Anyone can see that such things would not have been commanded unless they had been significative.

This does not mean that a nation of an unknown tongue or of an unintelligible speech should be brought; but an evil nation of an utterly different religion is meant, whose dogmas they shall not know nor understand the reasonings therefrom; and in an abstract sense the falsities of evil which are altogether contrary to the truths of good are signified; for “nation” in an abstract sense means evil, and “tongue” here means the falsity of religion, and “to speak” means to reason therefrom; therefore it is added, “it shall eat up thy harvest and thy bread,” for “harvest” signifies truths by which there is good, “bread” the good therefrom, and “to eat up” to consume and deprive. [12] In Ezekiel: Thou art not sent to a people of deep lip and heavy of tongue, but to the house of Israel; not to great peoples of deep lip and heavy of tongue, whose words thou shalt not hear. If I should send thee to them, will they not hearken unto thee? (3:5, 6). “Peoples of deep lip and heavy of tongue, whose words are not heard,” signify those who are in an unintelligible doctrine, and thus in an abstruse religion, whose dogmas cannot be comprehended, “lip” signifying doctrine, “tongue” religion, and “words” its dogmas; therefore these peoples mean the nations that do not have the Word, by which Jehovah, that is, the Lord, is known.

Evidently a people with a speech that cannot be understood is not meant; for it is added, “barbarous in tongue, without intelligence,” for there may be intelligence in the tongue or speech of such, but not in their religion. [14] In the same: I have sworn that unto Me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear (Isa. 45:23). This is said of the coming of the Lord; and “every knee shall bow” signifies that all who are in natural good from spiritual good will worship Him, the “knee” signifying the conjunction of natural good with spiritual. This shows that bending the knees signifies acknowledgment, thanksgiving, and adoration from spiritual good and delight in the natural; “every tongue shall swear” signifies that all will confess the Lord who are in good from religion, “to swear” signifying to confess, and “tongue” religion according to which one lives. [15] In David: And my tongue shall meditate of Thy righteousness and of Thy praise all the day (Ps. 35:28).

Moreover all falsities of doctrine in the church and all falsifications of the Word spring from the pride of self-intelligence and from the love of self.

[17] In the same: My soul, I lie in the midst of lions, the sons of man are set on fire, their teeth are spear and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword (Ps. 57:4). “Lions” signify those who plunder the church of truths, and thus destroy it; the “sons of man who are set on fire,” signify those who are in the truths of the church, and in an abstract sense the truths themselves, which are said to be “set on fire” by the pride of self- intelligence, whence come falsities; “their teeth are spear and arrows” signifies reasonings from external sensuals and thus from the fallacies and falsities of religion, by which truths are destroyed, “teeth” signifying the ultimates of man’s life, which are external sensual things, and here reasoning from these, and “tongue” signifying the falsities of religion; therefore it is said “their tongue a sharp sword,” “sword” signifying the destruction of truth by falsities.

These are both described by pure correspondences according to the ancient style. That reasoning from the light of nature by means of knowledges can be restrained by God only, is described in that chapter and the subsequent one by the “leviathan,” and also by these words, “Wilt thou draw out leviathan with a fish hook, and overwhelm his tongue with a cord?”; “tongue” signifying reasoning from knowledges. That the “leviathan” signifies the natural man as regards knowledges can be seen from other passages where it is mentioned (as Isaiah 27:1; Psalm 74:14; Psalm 104:26). Also from the fact that the “whale,” by which the leviathan is meant, signifies the natural man in regard to knowledges. [19] In Isaiah: The heart of the hasty shall have intelligence for knowing, and the tongue of the stammerers shall be swift to speak (32:4). The “hasty” mean those who readily seize upon and believe whatever is said, thus also falsities; of such it is said that “they shall be intelligent and know,” that is, receive truths; “stammerers” mean those who are hardly able to apprehend the truths of the church; that they will confess them from affection is meant by “their tongue shall be swift to speak,” “swiftness” is predicated of affection.

[21] This makes clear what is signified in the spiritual sense by “the deaf man that had an impediment in his speech” whom the Lord healed, which is thus described in Mark: Jesus took aside the deaf man who had an impediment in his speech, and put His fingers into his ears, and spitting, touched his tongue; and looking up into heaven, He said to him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened; and straightway his ears were opened, and the bond of his tongue was loosed, and he spake aright (7:32–35). The Lord’s miracles, because they are Divine, all involved and signified such things as pertain to heaven and the church, therefore they were healings of the diseases which signified the various healings of the spiritual life, as may be seen in Arcana Coelestia (n. 7337, 8364, 9031). The “deaf man” signifies those who are without the understanding of truth, and thence in no obedience; “his difficulty in speaking” signifies the difficulty of such in confessing the Lord and the truth of the church; the “ears” opened by the Lord signify the perception of truth and obedience; and the “tongue” whose bond was loosed by the Lord signifies the confession of the Lord and of the truths of the church.

The “fire” signified the love of truth, and “filled with the Holy Spirit” signified the reception of Divine truth from the Lord; and “new tongues” signified confessions from the love of truth or zeal; for, as was said above, all Divine miracles, consequently all miracles mentioned in the Word, involved and signified things spiritual and celestial, that is, such things that pertain to heaven and the church: by this Divine miracles are distinguished from miracles not Divine. It is unnecessary to quote more passages from the Word to show that “tongues” do not mean speech in the ordinary sense, but confessions from the truths of the church, and in the contrary sense confessions from the falsities of any religion. 456. Standing before the throne and before the Lamb, signifies those in the Lord’s kingdom. This is evident from the signification of “throne,” as being, in reference to the Lord, heaven and the church (of which above, n. 253). That “the Lamb” means the Lord in relation to the Divine Human may also be seen above (n. 314); consequently “standing before the throne and before the Lamb” signifies that they are in the Lord’s kingdom.

The good of truth, when it is with anyone, is the good of life, for truth becomes good by a life according to it; before that truth is not good in anyone. For when truth is merely in the memory and in thought therefrom it is not good, but it becomes good when it comes into the will and thence into act; for it is the will that transforms truth into good. This is shown by the fact that whatever a man wills he calls good, and whatever he thinks he calls truth. Man’s interior will, which is the will of his spirit, is the receptacle of his love, for that which a man loves from his spirit he wills, and that which he thence wills he does; therefore the truth that is of his will is also of his love, and that which is of his love he calls good. This makes evident how good is formed in man by means of truths, and that every good that is good in man is the good of life. It is believed that there is good of thought also, although not of the will, since man can have in thought that this or that is good; but yet this is not good, but truth; the thought that there is such a thing as good is a truth; and knowing and thus thinking that a thing is good is regarded as a truth; but when that truth in the thought is so loved as to be willed, and from being willed is done, then, since it belongs to the love, it becomes good. [2] This may be illustrated by the following example. There were spirits who in the life of the body had believed charity, and not faith alone, to be the essential of the church, and thus essential to salvation; nevertheless they had not lived the life of charity, for this was merely their thought and conclusion. But they were told that merely thinking, and from thought believing, that charity saves, and not willing and acting accordingly, is similar to believing that faith alone saves; therefore they were cast out. This makes evident"

The like would be true if a man should gain a knowledge of truths and goods themselves, and from mere thought should bear witness to them, without giving them life by willing and doing them. This has been said to make known that the good of truth, that is, spiritual good, when it is in anyone, is the good of life; and it is this that is signified by “palms in their hands.” [3] Because “palms” signify spiritual good, therefore in the temple built by Solomon there were, besides other things, palms sculptured on the walls, as described in the first book of Kings: Solomon carved all the walls of the house round about with openings of cherubim and palm trees and openings of flowers, within and without. Likewise upon the two doors (6:29, 32). “The walls of the house” signify the ultimates of heaven and the church, which are effects that go forth from things interior, and the “doors” signify the entrance into heaven and the church; the “cherubim” upon them signify celestial good, which is the good of the inmost heaven; the “palms” spiritual good, which is the good of the second heaven; and “the flowers” spiritual-natural good, which is the good of the lowest heaven: thus these three signify the goods of the three heavens in their order. But in the highest sense, the “cherubim” signify the Lord’s Divine Providence, and also guard; “palms” the Lord’s Divine wisdom; and “flowers” His Divine intelligence; for Divine good united to Divine truth proceeding from the Lord, is received in the third or inmost heaven as Divine Providence, in the second or middle heaven as Divine wisdom; and in the first or lowest heaven as Divine intelligence. [4] The “cherubim and palms” in the “new temple” have a similar significance in Ezekiel: In the new temple there were made cherubim and palm trees, so that a palm tree was between a cherub and a cherub; and the cherub had two faces; from the ground unto above the door. Cherubim and palm trees were made on the walls and on the folding doors (41:18–20, 25, 26)."

Because “the feast of tabernacles” signified the implantation of good by means of truths, it was commanded: That they should then take the fruit of the tree of honor, leaves of palm trees, and the boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook; and should be glad before Jehovah seven days (Lev. 23:39, 40). “The fruit of the tree of honor” signifies celestial good, “palm trees” spiritual good, that is, the good of truth, “boughs of thick trees” scientific truth with its good, and “willows of the brook” the lowest truths and goods of the natural man, which belong to external sensual things; thus these four signify all goods and truths in their order, from first to last in man. [5] Because “palms” signify spiritual good, and from spiritual good is all joy of the heart, for spiritual good is the affection itself or the love of spiritual truth, therefore formerly by “palms in their hands” men testified their joy of heart, and also that they were acting from good. This is the signification of the following: Many who came to the feast when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet Him, and cried out, Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord, the King of Israel (John 12:12, 13). [6] The “palm” signifies also spiritual good, or the good of truth, in the following passages. In David: The righteous shall flourish as the palm tree; he shall grow as the cedar in Lebanon. They that are planted in the house of Jehovah shall grow up in the courts of our God (Ps. 92:12, 13). “The righteous” signifies those who are in good, for by the “righteous” in the Word those who are in the good of love are meant, and by the “holy” those who are in truths from that good"

The “house of Jehovah in which they are planted,” and “the courts in which they shall grow up,” signify heaven and the church, “the house of Jehovah” the internal church, and “the courts” the external church; planting is effected in the interiors of man, where the good of love and of charity resides, and growing up takes place in the exteriors of man, where the good of life resides. [7] In Joel: The vine is withered, and the fig tree languisheth; the pomegranate tree, the palm tree also, and the apple tree, all the trees of the field are dried up; joy is dried up from the sons of man (1:12). This describes the desolating of truth and good in the church, and thence of all joy of heart, that is, of all spiritual joy; for the “vine” signifies the spiritual good and truth of the church, the “fig tree” the natural good and truth therefrom, and the “pomegranate” sensual truth and good, which is the ultimate of the natural; “palm” signifies joy of heart, from spiritual good, and “apple” the same from natural good derived from spiritual good; the “trees of the field that are dried up,” signify the perceptions of good and the knowledges of truth, that there are none; and because spiritual joy and natural joy therefrom are signified by the “palm tree” and the “apple tree,” it is added, “joy is dried up from the sons of man”; “sons of man” meaning in the Word those who are in truths from good, and “joy” signifying spiritual joy, which is solely from good through truths. Who cannot see that vine, fig tree, pomegranate, palm tree, apple tree, and the trees of the field are not here meant? Why should it be said in the Word and of what consequence is it to the church to say that these trees are withered and dried up? [8] In Jeremiah:"

This describes natural good separate from spiritual, which is good from one’s own (proprium), but this regarded in itself is not good, but the delight of cupidity chiefly from the love of self and the world, which is felt as a good. How man so forms this in himself as to give it the appearance of good, and to induce a persuasion that it is good, is described by “One cutteth wood out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman with the axe”; “wood” signifying good, here such good; “forest” the natural, here the natural separate from the spiritual; “the work of the hands of the workman with the axe” signifies what is from one’s own and from self-intelligence; the confirmation of this by means of truths and goods from the Word, which are thereby falsified, is described by “he doth deck it with silver and with gold,” “silver” meaning truth, and “gold” good from the Word; making these to cohere by confirmations from one’s own is described by “he doth fasten them with nails and with hammers, that it move not”; their thus appearing as good formed by truths is signified by “they are firm like a palm tree.” [9] In Moses: They came to Elim, where were twelve fountains of waters and seventy palm trees; and they encamped there by the waters (Exod. 15:27; Num. 33:9). This history also contains a spiritual sense, for there is a spiritual sense in all the histories of the Word. Here “they came to Elim” signifies a state of illustration and affection, thus consolation after temptation; “twelve fountains of water” signify that they then had truths in all abundance; “seventy palm trees” signify that they had goods of truths likewise; “and they encamped by the waters” signifies the arrangement of truth by good after temptation (this may be seen further explained in Arcana Coelestia, n. 8366–8370).

Because of this signification of “Jericho,” the Lord in the parable of the Samaritan said: That he was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho (Luke 10:30); which signifies by means of truths to good; for “Jerusalem” signifies the truth of doctrine, and “Jericho” the good of truth, which is the good of life, and this he exercised towards the man wounded by robbers. [11] Again, because of this signification of Jericho: When Joshua was by Jericho he saw a man standing with a drawn sword in his hand, who said to Joshua, Put off thy shoe from off thy foot in the place whereon thou standest, for it is holy. And Joshua did so (Josh. 5:13, 15). So, too, when the sons of Israel had taken Jericho by carrying the ark round about it, the silver and the gold and the vessels of brass and of iron which they found there they put into the treasury of the house of Jehovah (Josh. 6:24). From the above it is evident why Jericho was called “the city of palm trees.” [12] Furthermore, in the spiritual world, in the paradises where the angels are who are in spiritual good or in the good of truth, palm trees are seen in great abundance, from which also it is clear that the “palm tree” signifies the good of truth; for all things that appear in that world are representatives of the state of life and of the affections, thus of the good and truth with angels. 459.

Here adoration from the good of truth is signified, as is evident from what precedes and what follows; from what precedes because it is said “palms in their hands,” which signifies the good of truth in such (as has been shown just above); and from what follows because they cried out, “Salvation unto our God who sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb; and the angels, the elders, and the four animals, fell down before the throne and worshiped God.” Furthermore, all adoration of the Lord, which is confession, is from the good of truth, that is, from good through truths. “A great voice” also signifies truth from good; “voice” signifies truth, and “great” is predicated of good. (That “voice” signifies truth may be seen above, n. 261; and that “great” and “greatness” are predicated of good see also above, n. 336a, 337, 424). 460. Saying, Salvation unto our God who sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb, signifies confession that eternal life is from the Lord alone. This is evident from the signification of “saying,” as being to confess, for the confession follows; also from the signification of “unto Him who sitteth upon the throne and unto the Lamb,” as being the Lord in relation to Divine good and in relation to Divine truth; that the “one sitting upon the throne” means the Lord in relation to Divine good, and “the Lamb” the Lord in relation to Divine truth may be seen above (n. 134, 253a, 297, 314). It is evident also from the signification of “salvation” as being eternal life, for eternal life means in the Word eternal salvation. [2] “Salvation unto Him,” signifies that salvation is from Him, since He is salvation; for everything of salvation and of eternal life is from the Lord and is with man and angel; for all the good of love and all the truth of faith with man are the Lord’s with him, and not the man’s; for it is the Divine proceeding, which is the Lord in heaven with the angels and in the church with men, and from the"

In Isaiah: Lo, this is our God; we have waited for Him that He may save us; this is Jehovah; we have waited for Him; let us exult and be glad in His salvation (25:9). My salvation shall not delay; and I will give salvation in Zion, My splendor in Israel (46:13). I have given Thee for a light to the nations, that Thou mayest be My salvation unto the end of the earth (49:6). Say ye to the daughter of Zion, Behold thy salvation cometh (62:11). In David: Jehovah shall give out of40 Zion the salvation of Israel, when He shall bring back the captivity of His people (Ps. 14:7; 53:6). This is said of the Lord, who is here called salvation, from the act of saving, and for the reason that He is salvation with man, for so far as the Lord is with man so far man has salvation. So in Luke: Simeon said, Mine eyes have seen Thy salvation, which Thou hast prepared before the face of all peoples (2:30, 31). Again, this is why the Lord was called “Jesus,” for Jesus means salvation. [3] It is said, “who sitteth upon the throne, and the Lamb,” both of these meaning the Lord, “who sitteth upon the throne,” meaning the Lord in relation to Divine good, and “the Lamb” meaning the Lord in relation to Divine truth, both from His Divine Human (as has been shown above in the passages cited). Wherefore, elsewhere, the Lamb alone upon the throne is mentioned, as in Revelation (5:6), “Behold in the midst of the throne a Lamb standing,” also (7:17), “The Lamb who is in the"

The meaning is similar in these words, “who sitteth upon the throne, and the Lamb.” (That also “the Lamb” means the Lord’s Divine Human, and in a relative sense the good of innocence, see above, n. 314.) 461. Verses 11, 12. And all the angels stood around the throne, and the elders and the four animals, and they fell before the throne upon their faces, and worshiped God.

Verse 11. And all the angels stood around the throne, and the elders, and the four animals, signifies the conjunction of the Lord with the universal heaven.

That “the four and twenty elders” and “the four animals” mean in general the higher heavens, and in particular “the elders” mean those who are in the second or middle heaven, and “the four animals” those who are in the third or inmost heaven, may be seen above (n. 313a, 322, 362); from which it follows, that “the angels” here mean the lower heavens. All indeed who are in the heavens are called angels, but those who are in the higher heavens, since they are in greater intelligence and wisdom than the rest, are here called “elders,” and are meant by “the four animals,” so also they stood nearest around the throne, as was seen by John above. It is to be known that John saw a large number of angels, together with “four and twenty elders” and “the cherubim (or four animals),” and not all that are in the heavens, that is, the universal heaven; for this was a prophetic vision, which is such that the things seen are significative; here the few that were seen signified the entire or universal heaven, as “the four and twenty elders” signified the second or middle heaven, and the “four animals,” the third or inmost heaven. 463. And they fell before the throne upon their faces, and worshiped God, signifies thanksgiving from a humble heart that so many have been saved by the Lord. This is evident from the signification of “falling upon the face and worshiping,” as being here to give thanks from a humble heart; for “falling upon the face” signifies humiliation of heart, since to fall upon the face corresponds to such humiliation; for all the acts of the body so correspond to the affections of the mind that the two make one by correspondences; thus to fall upon the face before God in worship makes one by correspondence with humiliation of the heart.

It is said “they fell upon their faces and worshiped God”; “to fall upon the face” is a testification of humiliation of heart from the good of love, and “to worship God” is a testification of humiliation of heart by truths from that good. 464. Verse 12. Saying, Amen, signifies the Lord in relation to Divine truth from Divine good. This is evident from the signification of “Amen,” as being truth; and because the Lord is truth itself (as He teaches in John 14:6), “Amen” in the highest sense signifies the Lord in relation to Divine truth; here this is signified by “Amen” because it is spoken by the angels of the three heavens to the Lord. “Amen” here stands at the beginning of what is said and also at the end to signify that the Lord in relation to Divine truth from Divine good is in things first and in ultimates, or that the Lord Himself is the First and the Last; for Divine truth united to Divine good is the Lord in the heavens, for this is the Divine proceeding from which are all things of heaven, and heaven itself (as may be seen in the work Heaven and Hell, n. 13, 126–140, 275.

(That this is the meaning of “blessing” in the Word, see above, n. 340.) It is evident also from the signification of “glory,” as being the reception of Divine truth in things interior (see above, n. 34, 288, 345); also from the signification of “wisdom” as being the reception of Divine truth in things inmost, for from this is wisdom.

This the Lord plainly teaches in John: Herein is My Father glorified, that ye may bear much fruit, and may become My disciples (15:8). Father, all Mine are Thine, and all Thine are Mine, and I am glorified in them (17:10). This is like what is said above, “salvation be unto God” (see above, n. 460). Wherefore it was a custom with the ancients to say, “Blessed be God,” and “Blessing be to God,” likewise, “Glory and wisdom be to God,” by which they did not mean that to Him be blessing, glory, and wisdom, since it is from Him that all blessing, glory, and wisdom come; but they meant that these are from Him with all men. They spoke in this way that the things they had received they might ascribe to God only, and nothing to themselves, and because, speaking thus, they spoke from the Divine, and not from themselves. 466.

This is evident from this, that as “blessing, glory, and wisdom,” are predicated of the reception of Divine truth, so “thanksgiving and honor” are predicated of the reception of Divine good; for there are two things that proceed from the Lord, from which are all things in the heavens and on earth, namely, Divine truth and Divine good.

But so far as these two, Divine truth and Divine good, and thus the understanding and the will, are one with angels and men, so far are they in conjunction with the Lord; but so far as these are not one, angels and men are not in conjunction. [2] As the Word was given to men in order that by it there may be conjunction of the Lord with angels and with men, therefore in every part of it truth is conjoined to good, and good to truth, since in the Word, especially in the prophecies, there are two expressions, one of them referring to Divine truth, and the other to Divine good; but this conjunction in the Word is seen only by the angels in heaven, and by those on earth to whom it is granted to see the spiritual sense. For there are expressions that have reference to truth, and expressions that have reference to good; so where there are two expressions that have nearly the same meaning, one is significative of such things as belong to truth, and the other of such things as belong to good. There is this union in the Word because the Word is Divine, and from the Divine Divine truth united to Divine good proceeds.

These things have been said to make known that “blessing, glory, and wisdom,” are predicated of truths from the Divine (as was shown above, n. 465); and that “thanksgiving and honor” are predicated of goods from the Divine. That in the Word “glory” is predicated of truth, and “honor” of good, may be seen above, (n. 288, 345), where it is shown by various passages from the Word. “Thanksgiving” also is here predicated of good, for “blessing” is mentioned above, and blessing is expressed by the mouth by means of truths, while thanksgiving comes from the heart out of good."

(That “power” [potestas] when predicated of the Lord, means omnipotence, see above, n. 338; and that truths have all power [potentia] from good, or good has all power by means of truths, and that the Lord has omnipotence from Divine good by means of Divine truth, see also above, n. 209, 333; and in the work Heaven and Hell, n. 228–233.)

The expression “unto the ages of ages” is used, and not “to eternity,” because “ages of ages” is a natural expression, but “to eternity” a spiritual expression, and the sense of the letter of the Word is natural, while the internal sense is spiritual, and the latter is contained within the former. It is the same elsewhere in the Word. Thus in Daniel: To the Son of man there was given dominion, and glory, and a Kingdom; His dominion is a dominion of an age, which shall not pass away (7:14). In Isaiah: Trust ye in Jehovah, for in Jah Jehovah is the rock of ages (26:4). Israel hath been saved by Jehovah with a salvation of ages; ye shall not be ashamed to the everlasting ages ( 45:17)."

Verse 13. And one of the elders answered, saying to me, signifies influx out of heaven from the Lord, and perception therefrom. This is evident from the signification of “answering and saying,” when predicated of the “elders,” who signify heaven where the Lord is, as being influx and perception, “to answer” meaning influx, and “to say” perception; also from the signification of the “elders,” as being those who are in the second or middle heaven, where those are who are in intelligence, and through whom answers come (of which above, n. 462); and because all influx is from the Lord alone, although through the angels, these words signify influx and perception out of heaven from the Lord. That there is such a meaning in these words may seem strange; but in no other way are these words perceived in heaven. This seems strange because this is said as if it were historical, and historical things conceal the spiritual sense more than those purely prophetical; but all the historical parts of the Word also contain a spiritual meaning, and still more those that are historical-prophetical, which are such as appeared to and were said to the prophets when they were in the vision of the spirit; for all such things are representative and significative; as for instance, “the four and twenty elders” and “four animals” seen by John; this is historical-prophetical, representing and signifying the angels of the higher heavens, as has been shown above; so it follows that “one of the elders speaking to him” was likewise significative, signifying influx and perception out of heaven from the Lord. [2] “He answered” does not signify here to answer in the ordinary sense, as can be seen from its being said when there is no question, for to answer implies a question; so here it has reference to thought respecting those who were seen in white robes. Moreover, the expression “to answer” frequently occurs in the Word, and it signifies, in reference to the Lord, influx, inspira tion, perception, and information, likewise mercy and aid, as in the following passages.

In these and other passages, “to answer” means not to answer but to flow into the thought, to give perception, and to give help from compassion; from this it is that “answers,” in reference to the Lord, signify perceptions from influx.

(That angels think abstractedly from person and from place, and that their wisdom is from that, see above, n. 99, 100, 270, 325a.) From this it can be seen that “Who are they and whence came they?” signifies in the spiritual sense, of what quality they are and of what they have been; their quality is also described in what follows. 473. Verse 14. And I said unto him, Lord, thou knowest, signifies that the Lord alone knows this. This is evident from what has been said above (n. 471); namely, that by “one of the elders” who answered, and to whom it is now said “Lord, thou knowest,” is meant out of heaven from the Lord; for whatever in the Word is said to men by angels, is not said by the angels but by the Lord through them, for this reason here and there in the Word the angels that speak are called Jehovah; and for this reason the Word, even where it was spoken by angels, is Divine; for no one of himself, not even an angel, can speak such things as are Divine which are in the Word, nor in fact any truth which is in itself Divine; this the Lord only can do through the angels. This makes clear that “Lord, thou knowest,” signifies that the Lord alone knows it. 474.

The reason is that Divine truth proceeding from the Lord makes heaven, and makes the life of the angels there; consequently as falsities are the opposites of truths, and opposites destroy, these must first be removed, and they can be removed only by means of temptations. (That temptations perform this use, see in the New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine, n. 187–201, where temptations are treated of.) Such after their life in the body are let into temptations in the spiritual world because they could not be tempted while in the world on account of the falsities of their religion which reigned. Everywhere it is to be noted, that all who are let into temptations are saved; while the evil, who are in falsities from evil, are not tempted, for truths cannot be implanted in them; their evils of life stand in the way; but from these their truths are taken away, and thus they remain in mere falsities, and then they are plunged into hell, to a depth according to the quality of evil from which is falsity. In a word, those who are to come into heaven are vastated in respect to falsities, while those who are to come into hell are vastated in respect to truths; that is, from those who are to come into heaven falsities are taken away, and from those who are to come into hell, truths are taken away; for no one with falsities can enter heaven, and no one with truths can enter hell, since truths from good make heaven, and falsities from evil make hell. The temptations which those undergo with whom falsities are to be scattered are treated of in many passages in the Word, especially in David, and are called “afflictions,” “tribulations,” and “vastations”; but there is no need to cite these passages here, because it can be known without them that “tribulations” and “afflictions,” when predicated of the good, mean in the spiritual sense temptations. 475a.

Also from the signification of “robes,” as being protecting truths in general (of which above, n. 395); but “robes” here, before they have been washed and made white, signify falsities from which they have [not yet] been purified; for those who are in falsities from ignorance appear in the spiritual world at first in dusky garments of diverse colors, and while they are in temptations in filthy garments; but when they come out of temptations they appear in white robes, glistening according to their purification from falsities. Each one in the other life appears in garments according to the truths and according to the falsities that are with him;42 this is why “garments” signify truths, and in the contrary sense falsities (see above, n. 195, 271). From this the signification of “they have washed their robes and have made them white” can be seen. [2] In ancient times, when all the externals of the church were representative and significative of things spiritual and celestial, washings were made use of, and they represented purifications from falsities and evils; “washings” had this signification because “waters” signified truths, and “filth” falsities and evils, and all purification from falsities and evils is effected by truths (that “waters” signify truths see above, n. 71). This is why washings were instituted with the sons of Israel by command; for with them there was a representative church, all things of which were significative of things spiritual, and “washings” signified purifications from falsities and evils, and thence regeneration. For this purpose: A laver of brass was placed at the entrance of the tent of meeting (Exod. 30:18–20); Also lavers of brass were placed outside of the temple, one great laver which was called the sea of brass, and ten smaller ones (1 Kings 7:23–39).

Aaron and his sons were inducted into this representation by the washing by Moses; therefore it is said that “thus they should be sanctified,” although no sanctity was conferred upon them by the washing. [4] It was therefore also commanded that: Aaron and his sons should wash their hands and feet before entering into the tent of meeting, and before they came near to the altar to minister; and it is said that they were to do this that they die not; and that it should be to them a statute of an age (Exod. 30:18–21; 40:30, 31). Also that Aaron should wash his flesh before he put on the garments of ministry (Lev. 16:4, 24). “Washing the hands and feet” signified the purification of the natural man, and “washing the flesh” the purification of the spiritual man. It was therefore commanded also: That the Levites should be sanctified by being sprinkled with the water of expiation, and by causing a razor to pass over their flesh, and that they should wash their garments (Num. 8:6, 7). This was done to the Levites because they ministered in the external things of the church under Aaron and his sons, and the purification of the external things of the church was represented by the sprinkling of the water of expiation, by shaving the hairs of the flesh, and by washing the garments.

It was also commanded that the leper, after his cleansing, should wash his garments, shave off his hair, and wash himself with water (Lev. 14:8, 9). Also that such vessels as had become unclean by the touch of the unclean, should be passed through water (Lev. 11:32; besides other statutes). He is much mistaken who supposes that those who washed their flesh or hands and feet, or garments, were cleansed and sanctified, that is, purified from their sins; for sins are not washed away or taken away by water as filth is, but they are washed away, that is, removed, by means of truths and a life according to them, and this alone was what was represented by the washings; for “waters” signify truths, and truths when there is life according to them, purify the man.

Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first the inside of the cup and of the platter that the outside of them may become clean also (23:25, 26).

It is said that “the inside of the cup and platter must be cleansed that the outside may become clean also”; for the outside with man cannot be cleansed until the inside is cleansed, for the outside is cleansed by means of the inside. “The cup and platter” signify the interiors and exteriors of man, which receive truth and good, for the cup is what contains wine, and the platter is what contains food, and “wine” signifies truth, and “food” has a similar signification as “bread,” namely, good. This makes clear the signification in the spiritual sense of “cleanse first the inside of the cup and of the platter, that the outside may become clean also.” [7] What the Lord says here has a similar meaning as His washing the feet of the disciples, respecting which He thus said to Peter, in John: He that hath bathed needeth not save to wash his feet, but is wholly clean (13:10). “He that hath bathed” signifies one who is inwardly clean; and “needeth not save to wash his feet” signifies that then he must be cleansed outwardly, for “the feet” signify the external or natural man (see above, n. 69). More may be seen respecting this arcanum in the New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine, n. 179, 181; and in Arcana Coelestia, where the following are made clear: For a man to be purified, both the internal or spiritual and the external or natural must be purified, and the external by means of the internal, n. 3868, 3870, 3872, 3876, 3877, 3882.

To imbue the church with the good of love is signified by “I anointed thee with oil,” “oil” meaning the good of love. [10] In Isaiah: When the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have washed away the bloods of Jerusalem out of the midst thereof, in the spirit of judgment, and in the spirit of cleansing (4:4). “To wash away the filth of the daughters of Zion” signifies to purify the affections of those who are of a celestial church from the evils of love of self, “filth” meaning the evil of the love of self,”"

That from this come truths falsified is meant by “mine own garments shall abhor me”; “garments” meaning truths, which are said “to abhor one” when they are falsified, and this is done when man from self-intelligence speculates and draws conclusions.

From this it can be seen what these things signify in series; for all the miracles and works of the Lord when He was in the world signified Divine celestial and Divine spiritual things, that is, such things as pertain to heaven and the church, and this because they were Divine, and the Divine always operates in ultimates from first things, and thus in fullness; ultimates are such as appear before the eyes in the world. This is why the Lord spoke and the Word was written by means of such things in nature as correspond."

At length Naaman went down, and dipped himself seven times in Jordan; and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little lad, and he was clean (5:10, 14). “Naaman a leper of Syria” represented and signified those who falsify the knowledges of truth and good from the Word, for “leprosy” signifies falsifications, and “Syria” the knowledges of truth and good. “The waters of Jordan” signified the truths that introduce into the church, which are the knowledges of truth and good from the Word, for the river Jordan was the first boundary across which the land of Canaan was entered, and “the land of Canaan” signified the church; this is why “the waters of Jordan” signified introductory truths, which are the first knowledges of truth and good from the Word. Because of this signification of “the waters of Jordan,” Naaman was commanded to wash himself in them seven times, which signified purification from falsified truths; “seven times” signifies fully, and is predicated of things holy, such as truths Divine are. Because “seven times” has this signification, it is said that “his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little lad,” the flesh coming again signifying spiritual life, such as those have who are regenerated through Divine truths. [19] Because “the waters of Jordan” signified the truths that introduce into the church, which are the knowledges of truth and good from the Word, and “washing” therein signified purification from falsities, and consequent reformation and regeneration by the Lord, therefore baptism was instituted, which was first performed in Jordan by John (Matt. 3:11–16; Mark 1:4–13). This rite signified initiation into the knowledges from the Word respecting the Lord, His coming, and salvation by Him; and as man is reformed and regenerated by the Lord by means of truths from the Word, baptism was commanded by the Lord (Matt. 28:19); for it is by means of truths from the Word that man is reformed and regenerated, and it is the Lord who reforms and regenerates."

This means that John only inaugurated them into knowledges from the Word respecting the Lord, and thus prepared them to receive Him, but that the Lord Himself regenerates man by means of Divine truth and Divine good proceeding from Him; for John represented the like as Elijah, namely, the Word; “the waters” with which John baptized signified introductory truths, which are knowledges from the Word respecting the Lord; “the Holy Spirit” signifies Divine truth proceeding from the Lord; and “fire” signifies Divine good proceeding from Him; and “baptism” signifies regeneration by the Lord by means of Divine truths from the Word. [21] Washings were instituted in the ancient churches, and afterwards baptisms in their place, which nevertheless are only representative and significative rites, in order that heaven might be conjoined with the human race, and in particular with the man of the church; for heaven is conjoined to man when man is in ultimates, that is, in such things as are in the world in regard to his natural man, while he is in such things as are in heaven in regard to his spiritual man; in no other way is conjunction possible. This is why baptism was instituted; also the holy supper; likewise why the Word was written by means of such things as are in the world, while there is in it a spiritual sense, containing such things as are in heaven, that is, that the sense of the letter of the Word is natural, while in it there is a spiritual sense. (That by means of this sense the Word conjoins the angels of heaven with the men of the church, may be seen in the work Heaven and Hell, n. 303–310; and in the small work on the White Horse from beginning to end. That the holy supper likewise conjoins, see in the New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine, n. 210–222, and the same is true of baptism.)

The internal of baptism is, that by means of truths from the Word and a life according to them, falsities and evils may be removed by the Lord, and thus man be regenerated, as the Lord teaches (Matt. 23:26, 27), as explained above in this article. 476. And have made their robes white in the blood of the Lamb, signifies the implantation of Divine truth from the Lord. This is evident from the signification of “making robes white,” as meaning to put off falsities and to put on truths, for “white” and “to be made white,” are predicated of truths, and these are signified by “robes.” (That “white” and “to be made white,” are predicated of truths, see above, n. 196; and that “robes” signify truths in general see above, n. 395a.) It is said “made their robes white,” because the garments of those who are in falsities appear in the spiritual world dusky and also spotted, and the garments of those who are in temptations appear filthy; but as soon as they emerge from temptations, as they have then been imbued with Divine truths, white and shining garments without spots appear upon them, as was mentioned just above. This is why “they have made their robes white” signifies that they have put off falsities and put on truths. The above is evident also from the signification of “the blood of the Lamb” as being Divine truth proceeding from the Lord (of which above, n. 329a–f); and because in temptations falsities are shaken off, and truths are implanted, so in general, “they have made their robes white in the blood of the Lamb” signifies the implantation of Divine truth from the Lord. In the sense of the letter of the Word, “the blood of the Lamb” means the passion of the cross, but in the internal or spiritual sense it means Divine truth proceeding from the Lord; for it is by this that man is purified from falsities and evils, that is, his garments are made white. The passion of the cross was the Lord’s last temptation, by which He fully subjugated the hells, and glorified His Human; and when this was accomplished and completed, the Lord sent the Comforter, the Spirit of Truth, by which is meant Divine truth proceeding from His glorified Human, as the Lord teaches in John (7:39) and elsewhere.

(On this more may be seen in the New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine, n. 293, 294, and in the extracts there from Arcana Coelestia.) This can be seen from this also, that the garments of angels appear glistening from what is white and bright, not from faith in and thought about the blood of the Lord on the cross, but from Divine truth with them from the Lord; for, as was said above, their garments are all in accord with the truths with them; nor is any angel permitted to think of the Lord’s passion, but only of His glorification, and of the reception by Him of the Divine. 477. Verse 15. Therefore are they before the throne of God, signifies that for this reason they are conjoined to the Lord. This is evident from the signification of “are before the throne of God,” as being to be conjoined to the Lord. (That conjunction with the Lord is signified by “standing around the throne of God,” may be seen above, n. 462; and the like is signified by “are before the throne of God.”) “Before the throne of God” means before the Lord, for the Lord was upon the throne, as is said in verse 17 following, “The Lamb who is in the midst of the throne shall feed them.” 478. And they serve Him day and night in His temple, signifies that they are constantly held in truths in heaven. This is evident from the signification of “serving,” which is said of those who are in truths (of which presently); also from the signification of “day and night,” as being constantly and in every state (of which also presently); also from the signification of “the temple” of God, as being heaven where Divine truth reigns (of which above, n. 220, 391b ); therefore these words signify that they are constantly held in truths in heaven. This is the signification, because this treats of those who had been during their life in the world in falsities from ignorance, as was shown above; and those who are in falsities from ignorance and yet in good of life according to their religion cannot be saved before the falsities in them have been withdrawn and truths have been implanted in their place; and truths are implanted by means of temptations.

For this reason, unless those who had been in falsities from ignorance in the world were constantly held in truths by the Lord, they would fall back into falsities. This, therefore, is what is meant by “they serve Him day and night in His temple,” “temple” also signifying heaven where truths reign. [2] Their having been in the good of life according to their religion saves them, indeed, but it does not save so long as they are in falsities, therefore after their life in the world the falsities in them are withdrawn. They cannot be saved before, because good derives its essence from truths; for good is the esse of truth, and truth is the form of good, therefore according to the quality of the truths is the good. From this it is clear that even though one lives well he cannot come into heaven until he is in truths. On this account there are places of instruction for those who are to come into heaven, because no one can come thither until he has been instructed (of this instruction and the places of instruction for those who are to come into heaven, see in the work Heaven and Hell, n. 512–520). [3] It is said “they serve Him day and night in His temple,” but this does not mean that they are continually in a temple, or continually in worship and prayers, for this is not done in the heavens. Everyone there, as in the world, is in his vocation and employment, and on occasion, as in the world, in the temple; and yet they are said “to serve God day and night in the temple” when they are constantly in truths; for thus inwardly they constantly serve Him. For every good spirit and angel is his own truth and his own good, for they are the affections of truth and good. Affection or love constitutes the life of everyone; consequently those who are in the affection of truth constantly serve the Lord, even when they are in their vocations, business, and employments, for the affection that is within reigns continually and serves. Moreover, this is the service the Lord desires, but not being constantly in temples and in worship. To be in temples in worship there, and not in truths, is"

In the Word mention is made of “serving” and “ministering,” also of “servants” and “ministers,” and those who are in truths are said to be “servants of the Lord,” and “to serve Him,” while those who are in good are said to be “ministers of the Lord,” and “to minister to Him.” (That those are called “servants” in the Word who are in truths, may be seen above, n. 6; and that those are called “ministers” who are in good, n. 155.) 479. And He that sitteth on the throne shall dwell over them, signifies the influx of Divine good into the truths with them. This is evident from the signification of “He that sitteth on the throne,” as being the Lord in relation to Divine good (of which above, n. 297, 343, 460); also from the signification of “dwelling over them,” as being to flow in with good into their truths; for “to dwell” is predicated in the Word of good, thus “dwellers” signify those who are in good; so when “to dwell” is predicated of the Lord, as here, “to dwell over them” signifies the influx of Divine good; this is into truths, because the truths in such are what have just been treated of, also because all who are in the heavens are held in truths by the influx into truths of Divine good from the Lord; for it is only into truths that Divine good can flow, because truths are from good, for they are forms of good; this is why it is necessary for man to be in good, since by it the Lord flows into the truths corresponding to the good. He is much mistaken who supposes that the Lord flows immediately into truths with man.

From this it can now be seen how the things contained in this and the preceding verses cohere, namely, that those in whom truths from the Lord are implanted by means of temptations, are constantly held in truths by the influx into them of Divine good. (That “to dwell” is predicated in the Word of good, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 2268, 2451, 2712, 3613, 8269, 8309, 10153; and that “the dwelling place of the Lord” means heaven and the church in respect to good, consequently the good of heaven and the church, and in reference to man the good with him, n. 8269, 8309.) 480. Verse 16. They shall hunger no more, neither thirst anymore, signifies that good and truth shall not fail them, nor consequent felicity. This is evident from the signification of “to hunger,” as being the lack of good, therefore here “they shall not hunger,” means that there will be no lack of good; also from the signification of “to thirst,” as being the lack of truth, therefore here “they shall not thirst” means that there shall be no lack of truth. These same words signify also felicity, because all the felicity and blessedness that angels have in heaven are from and according to the good and truth they receive from the Lord, that is, according to the reception of these. That all heavenly felicity, or all heavenly joy, is in the affection of good and truth, consequently in the marriage of good and truth, in which the angels are, may be seen in the work Heaven and Hell (n. 395–414). “They shall not hunger” signifies that good shall not fail them, because “bread” signifies the good of love, and “to hunger” is predicated of bread and of food. “They shall not thirst” signifies that truth shall not fail them, because “water” and “wine” signify truth, and “to thirst” is predicated of water and of wine. This is why “to hunger” and “to thirst” are frequently mentioned in the Word, by which are meant not natural hunger and thirst but spiritual hunger and thirst, which are the deprivation, lack, and ignorance of the knowledges of truth and good, together with a desire for them. That this is the signification in the Word of “hungering and thirsting,” or of “hunger and thirst,” may be seen above (n. 386), where many passages respecting hunger and thirst are cited and explained."

A man who suffers himself to be led by the Lord is compared to a tree and its growth and fructification, because a “tree” signifies in the Word the knowledge and perception of truth and good, consequently the man in whom these are; “a tree planted by the waters” means a man with whom there are truths from the Lord, “waters” meaning truths; “that sendeth out his roots by the river” signifies the extension of intelligence from the spiritual man into the natural; this is said because a “river” signifies intelligence, and because “roots” are sent forth from the spiritual man into the natural; “he shall not see when heat cometh” signifies not to be affected by the lust of falsity; “but his leaf shall be green” signifies knowledges made alive by truths; “therefore he shall not be careful in the year of drought, neither shall he cease from bearing fruit” signifies that in a state when there is no truth and no good, there shall be no fear of the loss and deprivation of these, but that even then truths conjoined to good shall be fruitful, “year of drought” signifying a state of loss and deprivation of truth.

It is from this correspondence that in heaven flocks of sheep, lambs, and goats appear feeding in green pastures, and also in gardens; and these appearances spring from the thoughts of those who are in the goods and truths of the church, and who from these think intelligently and wisely. It is from this that mention is so often made in the Word of “flock,” “pasture,” as also of “feeding,” and “feeder” (or shepherd); for the Word in the letter consists of such things as appear in heaven before the eyes, and these signify correspondent spiritual things.

Also in many other passages, in which “to feed” signifies to instruct in truths, and “pasture” truths in which they are instructed. 483a. And shall guide them unto living fountains of waters, signifies in Divine truths. This is evident from the signification of “living fountains of waters,” as being Divine truths, “living” signifying living from the Divine, “fountain” the Word, and “waters” truths therefrom. “Living waters” are often mentioned in the Word, and by them are meant truths that come from the Lord and are received. These are living, because the Lord is Life itself, as He Himself teaches, and that which comes from Life itself is living; while that which comes from man is dead. That the Lord may give life to truths, He flows into them through good, and good makes alive. The Lord also flows in out of the higher or interior parts, and opens the spiritual mind, and imparts to it the affection of truth; and the spiritual affection of truth is the very life of heaven with man. This life is what the Lord insinuates into man by means of truths. This makes clear what is meant here by “living fountains of waters,” and by “living waters” in the following passages. [2] In Isaiah: When the poor and needy seek water and there is none, their tongue faileth for thirst. I will open rivers on the bare heights, and fountains will I place in the midst of the valleys; I will make the wilderness into a pool of waters, and the dry land into springs of waters (41:17, 18).

This makes clear that “waters,” “fountains,” “springs,” “rivers,” and “pools of water,” are not here meant, but the knowledges of truth and intelligence therefrom, whence comes salvation. [3] In the same: Behold your God will come for vengeance, and will save you. Then the dry place shall become a pool, and the thirsty place springs of water (Isa. 35:4, 7). This, too, is said of the instruction of the nations in truths, and their reformation by the Lord when He should come into the world; and “the dry place shall became a pool, and the thirsty place springs of waters,” has a similar signification as “the wilderness shall become a pool (or collection) of waters, and the dry land springs of waters,” in the passage above.

This also is said of the instruction of the Gentiles by the Lord; instruction in truths is meant by “unto fountains of waters shall He lead them.” (What “to hunger” and “to thirst” signify see above, n. 480; also what “heat” and “sun” signify, n. 481.) [5] In Joel: It shall come to pass in that day that the mountains shall drop down must, and the hills shall flow with milk, and all the watercourses of Judah shall flow with waters, and a fountain shall go forth out of the house of Jehovah and shall water the brook of Shittim (3:18). What is signified by “the mountains shall drop down must, and the hills shall flow with milk, and all the watercourses of Judah shall flow with waters,” may be seen explained above (n. 433c); and that “a fountain shall go forth out of the house of Jehovah and shall water the brook of Shittim” signifies that there shall be truth out of heaven from the Lord illustrating the knowledges and cognitions that are in the natural man. [6] In David: Before Thee thou art in travail, O earth, before the God of Jacob; who turned the rock into a pool of waters, the flint into a fountain of waters (Ps. 114:7, 8). “Pool of waters” and “fountain of waters” here mean truths in abundance, by means of which is the church; for “thou art in travail, O earth,” signifies the commencement of the church, which is said “to be in travail” when truths are brought forth therein, “the earth” meaning the church.

The instruction of those who are in the good of the church is signified by “they give drink to the wild beast of the fields”; the instruction of those in the church who desire truths is signified by “the wild asses quench their thirst”; that the understanding is thus perfected is signified by “the fowl shall dwell by them.” “The wild beast of the fields” mean in the spiritual sense the Gentiles that are in the good of life, “the wild asses” natural truth, “thirst” the desire for truths, and “the fowl of the heavens” thoughts from the understanding. 483b. [8] In the highest sense, a “fountain” means the Lord in relation to Divine truth or Divine truth from the Lord, consequently the Word, as can be seen from the following passages. In Jeremiah: My people hath done two evils; they have forsaken Me, the fountain of living waters, to hew out for themselves cisterns, broken cisterns, that hold no waters (2:13). Here Jehovah, that is, the Lord, calls Himself “the fountain of living waters,” which signifies the Word, or Divine truth, consequently the Lord Himself, who is the Word; for it is said, “they have forsaken Me, the fountain of living waters.” “To hew out for themselves cisterns, broken cisterns, that hold no waters,” signifies to frame for themselves doctrinals from self-intelligence, in which there are no truths, “cisterns” meaning doctrinals, “broken cisterns” doctrinals that do not hold together, “that hold no waters” signifies in which there are no truths.

Here in like manner Jehovah, that is, the Lord, calls Himself “the fountain of living waters” from the Divine truth, which is from Him; “to be written on the earth” signifies to be damned (see above, n. 222b). [10] In David: They shall be filled with the fatness of Thy house; and Thou makest them drink of the brook of Thy delights; for with Thee is the fountain of life, in Thy light shall we see light (36:8, 9). “Fatness” signifies the good of love, and “the brook of delights” truth from that good; “to make to drink” means to teach; “with Thee is the fountain of life” signifies that with the Lord and from Him is Divine truth; because that is what is signified by “the fountain of life” it is added, “in Thy light shall we see light,” for “the light of the Lord” means Divine truth.

Because the Word or the Divine truth therein is meant by a “fountain” it is said, “In that day I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land, and I will cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land”; “idols” signifying a false religion, “prophets” false doctrine, and “the unclean spirit” evils flowing from the falsities of doctrine; for when a man lives according to the falsities of religion and doctrine he becomes an unclean spirit. [12] That Divine truth from the Lord is meant by a “fountain” the Lord Himself teaches in plain words in John: When the Lord sat by Jacob’s fountain in the field of Samaria, He said to the woman of Samaria, Everyone that drinketh of this water shall thirst again; but whosoever shall drink of the water that I shall give him shall not thirst forever; but the water that I shall give him shall become in him a fountain of water springing up unto everlasting life (4:5–20). It is clear that the “water” that the Lord gives does not mean water, but Divine truth; for it is said that in drinking of the water the woman of Samaria came to draw, one thirsts again, but not of the water that the Lord gives. That “that water shall become in him a fountain of water springing up unto everlasting life” means that in that truth is life. That there is life in truths when the Lord gives them may be seen in this article above. The Lord said these things to the woman of Samaria, when He sat by Jacob’s fountain, because by the “Samaritans” the Lord meant the Gentiles that were to receive Divine truths from Him; and by the “woman of Samaria” a church constituted of such; and by “Jacob’s fountain” Divine truth from Himself, that is, the Word.

This is said at the end of that prophecy, because in that prophecy the Word is treated of. “Fountain” has a similar meaning in the prophecy of Israel the father respecting Joseph: The son of a fruitful one is Joseph, the son of a fruitful one by the fountain (Gen. 49:22). “Fountain” here means the fountain of Jacob, for the field that contained that fountain was given to Joseph by his father (John 4:5, 6). What is signified by “Joseph the son of a fruitful one, the son of a fruitful one by the fountain,” may be seen above (n. 448b). A “fountain” also means the Word, and “fountains” mean Divine truths from the Word, in David: Bless ye God in the congregations, the Lord from the fountain of Israel (Ps. 68:26). In Revelation: I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely (21:6). In Isaiah: Then with gladness shall ye draw waters out of the fountains of salvation (12:3). In David: All my fountains are in Thee, Jehovah (Ps. 87:7). [14] As most things in the Word have also a contrary sense, so have “fountain” and “fountains,” and in that sense they signify the doctrine of falsities, and falsities of doctrine.

This is said of Ephraim, and by him is here meant a perverted understanding of the Word which confirms falsities by means of the Word; its destruction is signified by “his fountain shall become dry, and his spring shall be dried up by the east wind, the wind of Jehovah from the wilderness”; “his fountain” meaning the doctrine of falsity thence, “spring” its falsity, and “the east wind from the wilderness” its destruction by fallacies that are from external sensual things; for external sensual things, when they are not illustrated from things internal, destroy man’s understanding, because all fallacies are from that source.

Thou hast crushed in the heads of leviathan, and hast given him to be food to the people, for the Ziim.

Here, too, “fountains” and “brooks” signify false doctrine, which is from self-intelligence; “the rivers of strength” are confirmed principles of falsity therefrom; “the whales” and “leviathan” signify knowledges (scientifica) belonging to the sensual and natural man, from which is all falsity when the spiritual man is closed over them. The sensual and natural man are the seat of what is man’s own (proprium), therefore conclusions drawn from those alone are conclusions from one’s own or from self-intelligence; for the Divine flows in through the spiritual man into the natural, and not into the natural when the spiritual is closed over it, but the spiritual man is opened by means of truths and a life according to them."

This is evident from the signification of “wiping away tears from the eyes,” as being to take away grief of mind on account of falsities and from falsities; and as blessedness through truths from good follows when that grief ceases after the temptations that have been endured, so this too is signified; for angels have all their blessedness through truths from good, or through the spiritual affection of truth; the spiritual affection of truth is from good, and good constitutes it. This is the source of all blessedness with angels, because Divine truth proceeding from the Lord constitutes heaven in general and in particular, therefore those who are in Divine truths are in the life of heaven, consequently in eternal blessedness. [2] A “tear from the eyes” signifies grief of mind on account of falsities and from falsities, because the “eye” signifies the understanding of truth; a “tear” therefore signifies grief because there is no understanding of truth, consequently because of falsities. “Tear” has a similar signification in Isaiah: He will swallow up death forever, and the Lord Jehovih will wipe away tears from off all faces (25:8). This signifies that the Lord by His coming will remove evils and falsities with those who live from Him, so that there will be no grief of mind on account of them and from them; “death” signifies evil, because spiritual death is from it; and “tear” is predicated of falsity. [3] It is to be noted, that both “shedding tears” and “weeping” signify grief on account of falsities and from falsities, but “shedding tears” grief of mind, and “weeping” grief of heart on account of falsities.

That “weeping” means grief of heart can be seen from the fact that “weeping” bursts forth from the heart and breaks out into lamentations through the mouth; and that “shedding tears” is grief of mind can be seen from this, that it issues forth from the thought through the eyes. In both weeping and in the shedding of tears water comes forth which is bitter and astringent, and this occurs through an influx into man’s grief from the spiritual world, where bitter water corresponds to the lack of truth because of falsities, and to consequent grief; therefore those who are in truths grieve on account of falsities. From this it can be seen why it is that in the Word, where “tears” are mentioned “weeping” also is mentioned, namely, that it is on account of the marriage of good and truth in every particular of the Word. [4] I will only adduce the following passages in evidence of this. In Isaiah: I will weep with weeping for Jazer, the vine of Sibmah; I will water thee with my tears, O Heshbon and Elealeh (16:9).

In David: I am weary with my sighing, all the night do I bathe my bed; with my tears I make my couch to melt (Ps. 6:6). Here “to bathe the bed” means by weeping, which is of the mouth, because it is said of sighing; while “to drench the couch,” which has a like meaning, has reference to tears.

And I saw the seven angels who stood before God, signifies the heavens more interiorly and more closely conjoined to the Lord. This is evident from the signification of “seven angels,” as meaning all the heavens; “seven” signifying all persons and all things (see above, n. 257, 299), and “angels” signifying the heavens (see also above, n. 90, 302, 307); also from the signification of “standing before God,” as being to be conjoined to the Lord (of which see above, n. 462, 477). Why “the seven angels who stood before God” signify that now all the heavens were more interiorly and more closely conjoined to the Lord, will be explained in the following article. 489a.

[3] That all changes of state and separations of the evil from the good, and of the good from the evil, that occurred before the judgment and during the judgment, were effected by an interior influx, more intense or more moderate, of divine good and truth from the Lord out of heaven, has been said and shown above (n."

[4] This separation of the evil from the good when the Lord conjoins the angels to Himself more interiorly and closely by a strong influx into their spiritual good, and through this into the interiors of the evil, may be comprehended by those who are in some measure of intelligence; for through such influx the interiors in the evil also who have only feigned goodness in externals are opened, and when their interiors are opened the evils and falsities that lie inwardly concealed are manifested; this is done because they have no spiritual good; and external good without spiritual good is only apparent good, in itself feigned and hypocritical. That it is such is not evident until the interiors are uncovered and laid open. Spiritual good is formed with man by the Lord by means of truths and a life according to them; but external good, separate from internal spiritual good, is formed by a moral life having for its end self and the world, or honors, gain, and the enjoyments of the flesh; and if these alone are considered, Divine truths are regarded as of no account except as means of acquiring reputation; and this has as its sole end the external things above mentioned. (Of internal and external good with the good, and of these with the evil, see in the New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine, n. 36–53.) These things have been mentioned in advance in order that what follows may be understood.

This is evident from the signification of an “angel,” as being heaven (of which presently); also from the signification of “altar,” as being the good of love to the Lord (of which also presently). An “angel” signifies the angelic heaven because the things seen by John were representative; and as heaven could not be presented to his view, therefore instead of the heavens angels were seen; as also above, “seven angels who stood before God” (n. 488); so also “four and twenty elders and four animals” which represented the heavens (above, n. 313a, 332, 362, 462); so here, “the angel who stood at the altar.” The angels seen by John represented heaven, because the whole heaven before the Lord is as one angel-man, likewise each society of heaven; also because the angel derives his angelic form, which is the human form, from the universal heaven. (Respecting this see in the work Heaven and Hell, n. 51–58, 59–67, 68–72, 73–77, 78–86, where this arcanum is fully unfolded.) For this reason when an angel appears representatively, he represents either the society of heaven from which he is, or many societies together, or the universal heaven in respect to that in heaven and the church that is treated of. That “angels” in the Word signify entire societies in heaven, and also the whole heaven, may be seen above (n. 90, 302, 307). This angel “who stood at the altar” signifies the inmost or third heaven, because the “altar” signifies the good of love to the Lord, and all who are in the inmost or third heaven are in that good. [2] An altar was seen in heaven not because any altar exists there such as the Israelitish nation had; but as that altar is frequently mentioned in the Word, and it signifies the good of love to the Lord and worship from that good, so an altar was seen by John, by whom the Word was also written, in order that the Word may be everywhere consistent with itself. For a similar reason he saw a golden altar, which was for the offering of incense, also a censer and incense, which are also presently mentioned; as also the ark of the Covenant (chap. 11:19). For many representatives appear in heaven to those who stand below, which nevertheless do not actually exist there, but are only representative forms of such things as the angels there are thinking from the influx of the Lord;"

So here also an altar, a censer, and incense appeared, which were exhibited before John’s sight because these are mentioned in the Word and there signify things Divine, and because the Word in Revelation was to be written by means of similar things. There were two altars in use with the Israelitish nation, one called “the altar of burnt offering,” the other “the altar of incense,” and because this one was overlaid with gold it was called “the golden altar.” The altar of burnt offering was a representative of the Lord and of the worship of Him from celestial good; and the altar of incense was a representative of the Lord and of the worship of Him from spiritual good. Celestial good is the good of love to the Lord, and spiritual good is the good of charity towards the neighbor. But what altars represented and signified in general and in particular, may be seen above (n. 391). 491.

This is evident from the signification of a “censer,” as being worship from spiritual good, for such worship was represented by incense from the censers (see above, n. 324). “Having a golden censer” signifies the conjunction of celestial good with spiritual good, because the angel standing at the altar had a censer, and the “altar” signifies worship from celestial good, and “a golden censer” spiritual good from celestial good, “gold” signifying celestial good. The censers that were in use with the Jewish and Israelitish nation were of brass; and the offerings of incense from those censers represented worship from spiritual good, and conjunction at the same time with natural good, for “brass” signifies natural good; so here “a golden censer” signifies the conjunction of celestial good with spiritual good. It also signifies the conjunction of the two higher heavens, because the good of the inmost heaven is celestial good, and the good of the middle heaven is spiritual good; when therefore the conjunction of these goods is mentioned, the conjunction of the heavens is also meant, because the good is what constitutes the heaven.

[2] “Frankincense” in the Word signifies spiritual good, the same as the censer that contained it (where the containant is taken for the content), as can be seen in the following passages. In Isaiah: I have not made thee to serve by a meal offering, nor wearied thee by frankincense (43:23). “A meal offering and frankincense” are mentioned, because the “meal offering,” which was made of fine flour and was therefore bread, signifies celestial good, consequently “frankincense” signifies spiritual good. Both are mentioned because in every part of the Word there is a marriage of good and truth, that is, where it treats of good it also treats of truth, and spiritual good in its essence is truth; this shows that “frankincense” means spiritual good, or the truth of celestial good. This can be seen further from other passages in which “meal offering” and “frankincense” are mentioned together. Thus in Isaiah: Causing the meal offering to ascend, offering frankincense (66:3). [3] In Jeremiah: They shall offer the whole burnt offering and the sacrifice, the meal offering and frankincense (17:26). “Burnt offering” also signifies worship from the good of celestial love, and “sacrifice” worship from the good of spiritual love; these two goods are signified also by “meal offering and frankincense.” The like is true of “meal offering and incense offering,” for the incense offering was chiefly of frankincense. In Malachi: In every place incense is offered to My name, and a clean meal offering (1:11). In David:"

This makes evident the signification of the angel that was seen at the altar having a golden censer, for the “altar” was representative of celestial good, and the censer was representative of spiritual good, and the two together were representative of the conjunction of celestial good with spiritual good, or what is the same, of the conjunction of the higher heavens, or of the heaven where celestial angels are with the heaven where the spiritual angels are. 492. And there was given unto him much incense, signifies truths in abundance. This is evident from the signification of “incense,” as being the truths of spiritual good; also from the signification of “much,” as being an abundance of truths, for “multitude” is predicated in the Word of truths, and “magnitude” of good. “Incense” signifies truths, because the offerings of incense represented worship from spiritual good, and “frankincense” signified that good, as was shown in the article above; therefore “incense offerings” of frankincense represented what proceeds from that good, and truths are what proceed from that good; for truths are what that good, that is, what man from that good, thinks and speaks. Moreover, spiritual good is formed in man by means of truths; for truth becomes spiritual good with man when he lives according to it (see above, n. 458a); thus spiritual good is in its essence truth (see also above, n. 376a, b, e).

[2] That these words signify the conjunction of the heavens with those who are to be separated from the evil and saved, can be seen from the series of things in the internal sense, and from the connection of what goes before with what is now said and with what follows, and also from the signification of the words in the internal sense. For this and the following chapters treat of the last state of the church, or its state when its end has come and the judgment is at hand; but before this state is described, the separation of those who were to be saved is treated of, who are all such as are meant by “those sealed on their foreheads,” and by “those clothed in white robes” who were treated of in the preceding chapter. Because these were at that time associated in societies with those who were to be damned, in this chapter the means by which they were separated and saved are described, namely, that the higher heavens were first closely conjoined with the Lord by Divine influx into celestial good, and through that into spiritual good, and afterwards by Divine influx through these goods, conjoined into one, into the lower regions where those who were to be saved and those who were to be damned were together in societies. This influx of the Lord out of the higher heavens was received by those who in the world had lived in good, for that good continued with them, therefore by means of that good they were conjoined to the higher heavens, and thus separated from those who were unable to receive the influx, because they had not lived in good but in evil while they were in the world. [3] This also is what is meant by the Lord’s words in the Gospels: Then shall two men be in the field, one shall be taken, the other shall be left. Two women shall be grinding, one shall be taken, the other shall be left (Matt. 24:40, 41; Luke 17:34–36)."

From this it can now be seen what the spiritual sense is of these words, “that he should offer the incense with the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar which is before the throne,” namely, the conjunction of the higher heavens with those who were to be separated from the evil and saved. The “prayers” with which the incense was to be offered do not mean prayers, but truths from good, by means of which prayers are offered; for truths with man are what pray, and man is continually in such prayers when he lives according to truths. (That “prayers” mean in the Word truths from good which are with man, and not prayers of the mouth, may be seen above, n. 325.) 494. Verse 4. And the smoke of the incense with the prayers of the saints ascended out of the angel’s hand before God, signifies the conjunction of all with the Lord.

This is why “smoke” became representative; “the smoke of the incense,” which was agreeable from its fragrance and sweet odor, was a representative of truth from good; for “fragrance and sweet odor” signify what is agreeable and acceptable (see above, n. 324a). “Smoke” has a similar signification in Moses:"

Thence also “smoke” in the contrary sense signifies falsity from evil (in Isa. 34:10; Joel 2:30; Nah. 2:13; Ps. 18:8; 37:20), because the fire that makes such smoke signifies the evil of love. 495.

The fire shall be kept burning continually upon the altar, it shall not be quenched (Lev. 6:12, 13). This represented that the Lord’s Divine love is unceasing and eternal.

And that Aaron took fire from off the altar, and put incense on it, by which expiation was made for the people (Num. 16:46, 47).

Incense offering from strange fire represented worship from love other than Divine, and worship from any other love is profane. [5] These passages have been cited to make known that “the fire of the altar” signifies the Lord’s Divine love, which love in heaven is called Divine celestial love and Divine spiritual love; Divine celestial love is in the Lord’s celestial kingdom, and Divine spiritual love is in the Lord’s spiritual kingdom. For there are two kingdoms, into which all the heavens are divided, the celestial kingdom and the spiritual kingdom; Divine celestial love constitutes the celestial kingdom, and Divine spiritual love the spiritual kingdom. (That all the heavens are divided into these two kingdoms, see in the work Heaven and Hell, n. 20–28; and that these two loves constitute these two kingdoms, or all the heavens, n. 13–19.) But it must be noted that the Lord’s Divine love in the heavens is called celestial and spiritual from its reception by the angels, and not from its being divided in itself; also that spiritual love springs from celestial love as an effect from its effecting cause, and as truth from good; for the good of spiritual love is in its essence the truth of the good of celestial love. For this reason these two kingdoms are conjoined with each other and are one in the Lord’s sight. But this has been said for those who love to search into interior things.

(That the face of things in the spiritual world is similar in this respect as upon our globe is shown in many passages in the work Heaven and Hell; also in the small work on the Last Judgment; as well as frequently in the above explanations.) From this it can be seen that “he cast the censer filled with the fire of the altar unto the earth” signifies the influx of the Divine love out of the heavens into the lower parts, where those were who were to be separated and removed. For there were societies below upon the lands there, in which the good and the evil were together, and these had to be separated from each other before the Last Judgment could take place; for from the time of the Lord until the time of the Last Judgment, all who could live an external moral life, and thus imitate a spiritual life in appearance were tolerated. (That these were tolerated even until the judgment, and why, see in the small work on the Last Judgment, n. 59, 69, 70; and that “the former heaven” which was destroyed was formed out of these, n. 65–72.) And in the same societies, or “in the former heaven,” there were also the simple good, some associated with the others there, and some elsewhere, but conjoined with the others by a holy and pious external; and yet it was necessary that the good should be separated from the evil before the judgment, in order that the good might be elevated into heaven and the evil be cast into hell; and as this separation was effected by the influx of Divine good and truth out of the heavens into those lower parts where they all were, thence it can be seen that “He cast down the censer filled with the fire of the altar” signifies this influx into the lower parts.

The cause of such conflicts and disturbances is the closing of the externals with the evil by influx out of the heavens, and the opening of the internals, the externals being that which simulated goods and truths, while the internals thought evil and falsity; when therefore their externals were closed and their internals were opened, there arose a conflict and disturbance of the affections and thoughts respecting good and evil and truth and falsity, and consequent reasonings. Such things are heard in the spiritual world as the voices of a multitude, murmuring, grating, menacing, and combating; and at a distance, where the voices are not heard, they are heard and seen as thunders and lightnings; as thunders from the conflict of the affections, and as lightnings from the conflict of the thoughts therefrom. As these things arise from the flowing down of Divine good and truth out of the higher heavens into the lower parts, therefore the voices, thunders, and lightnings, when heard and seen by the good, signify Divine truth in respect to perception and illustration (on the signification of these, see n. 273, 353); but it is otherwise when these are heard and seen by the evil. 499. And an earthquake, signifies changes of state of the church. This is evident from the signification of “earthquakes,” as meaning changes of state of the church (of which above, n. 400). In the same place it is shown that in the spiritual world the lands quake, and the hills and mountains are shaken, when the state of the church there is changed for the worse and evil and falsity begin to rule. Earthquakes occur in the spiritual world for the reason that all the lands there are from a spiritual origin, and are changed with the changing of the church with those there. Where the church is flourishing the country is beautiful, and full of paradises, flower gardens, and lawns; but where the church is perverted, it is unbeautiful, and full of deserts and rocks; and the change is in exact accord with the decline of the church from good and truth into evil and falsity; but this takes place only in the lower parts (on this see in the work Heaven and Hell, n. 156, and elsewhere).

And the seven angels having the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound, signifies changes in their order to arise from the influx out of heaven. This is evident from the signification of “the seven angels who stood before God,” as being the heavens conjoined to the Lord more interiorly and closely (of which above, n. 488); also from the signification of “sounding the trumpets,” as being influx, and the consequent changes of state and separations (of which see also above, n. 489); and because what now follows treats in order of the changes of state arising from influxes out of heaven, this is signified by “the seven angels having the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.” 501. Verse 7. And the first angel sounded, and there was hail and fire mingled with blood; and they were cast unto the earth; and the third part of the trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up. 7. “And the first angel sounded,” signifies influx out of heaven, and in consequence the first change (n. 502); “and there was hail and fire mingled with blood,” signifies the destroying infernal falsity and evil, mingled with the truths and goods of the Word, to which violence was offered (n. 503, 504); “and they were cast unto the earth,” signifies progression towards the lower parts (n. 505); “and the third part of the trees was burnt up,” signifies that the perceptions and knowledges of truth and good were destroyed by cupidities arising from evil loves (n. 506); “and all green grass was burnt up,” signifies that all true knowledge (scientificum) was destroyed by the cupidities of the same loves (n. 507). 502a. Verse 7. And the first angel sounded, signifies influx out of heaven, and in consequence the first change. This is evident from the signification of “sounding a trumpet,” as being the influx of Divine truth out of heaven; and as the first change resulting therefrom is now described, this also is what is signified. “To sound a trumpet” signifies the influx of Divine truth out of heaven, because when Divine truth flows down out of heaven it is sometimes heard in the spiritual world as the sound of a horn or as the blast of a trumpet, and also to those who stand below there appear as it were angels having trumpets; but these are representations and appearances, such as exist below the heavens, for it is Divine truth descending or flowing down out of heaven"

[2] When this flowing down is strong it produces one effect with the good and another with the evil. With the good it illustrates the understanding, joins them more closely with heaven, and thence gladdens and vivifies their minds; but with the evil it disturbs the understanding, separates them from heaven, joins them more closely with hell, induces terror in their minds, and finally brings spiritual death. This makes clear that “sounding a trumpet” signifies, in its effect, the revelation and manifestation of Divine truth (see above, n. 55, 262); and in the contrary sense the deprivation of truth and desolation. Since it is here said that the angels sounded seven times, it is necessary to show from the Word what “to sound” signifies, and thence why it is said “the angel sounded.” [3] That “to sound trumpets” and “horns” signifies revelation and manifestation of Divine truth, is evident from the sound of a trumpet that was heard when Jehovah descended upon Mount Sinai and promulgated the Law, which is thus described in Moses: And it came to pass on the third day when it was becoming morning, that there were voices and lightnings, and a heavy cloud upon the mount (Sinai), and the voice of a horn exceeding strong; and all the people that were in the camp trembled when Jehovah descended upon it in fire. And the voice of the horn went on and became exceeding strong. And Jehovah said unto Moses, Go down, testify to the people lest they break through unto Jehovah to see, and many of them fall (Exod. 19:16–25). The “Law” that was then promulgated signifies Divine truth; the “voice of a horn” represented its flowing down out of heaven and its manifestation; “the voice of the horn going on and becoming exceeding strong” represented the increase of this influx in approaching the lower parts, for it is said that “the people stood in the lower parts of the mount”; that “the people trembled exceedingly,” and were admonished “not to approach nearer to the mountain lest they perish,” signifies the effect of the flowing down of Divine truth with such as the sons of Jacob were.

[4] “To sound horns” and “trumpets” represented and thus signified Divine truth coming down and flowing in out of heaven, as can be seen from the institution and use of trumpets among the sons of Israel. For it was commanded: That trumpets should be made of silver, and that the sons of Aaron should sound them for convocations, for journeyings, on days of gladness, on feast days, in the beginnings of months, over sacrifices, for a memorial, and for battle (Num. 10:1–10). They were made of silver, because “silver” signifies truth from good, thus Divine truth. (That “silver” has this signification, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 1551, 1552, 2954, 5658.) The “sons of Aaron sounded them,” because Aaron himself as chief priest represented the Lord in relation to Divine good, and his sons the Lord in relation to Divine truth (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 9806, 9807, 9966, 10017). They were sounded for convocations and journeyings, because Divine truth is what calls together, gathers together, teaches the way, and leads. They were sounded on days of gladness, at feasts, in the beginnings of months, and over sacrifices, because Divine truth coming down out of heaven produces gladness and the holiness of worship. They were sounded for wars and for battle to signify that with the evil, who are the “enemies” in the Word, Divine truth flowing down out of heaven produces the terror of death, puts to flight, and disperses; in this sense, and because of this effect, it is here said that “the seven angels sounded” in their order. 502b. [5] Because it was commanded that they should sound trumpets for convocations, it is said by the Lord in Malachi: He shall send His angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together His elect from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other end (24:31)."

[6] In Isaiah: In that day a great horn shall sound, and those perishing in the land of Assyria shall come, and the outcasts from the land of Egypt, and shall bow down to Jehovah in the mountain of holiness, at Jerusalem (27:13). This is said of the Lord’s coming; a convocation to the church and salvation by the Lord are signified by “In that day a great horn shall sound, and those perishing in the land of Assyria shall come, and the outcasts from the land of Egypt”; “to sound a horn” signifies Divine truth calling together and saving; “those perishing in the land of Assyria” mean those who are deceived by false reasonings, and “the outcasts from the land of Egypt” those who are deceived by knowledges (scientifica), thus the Gentiles that were in falsities from ignorance of the truth; that these shall worship the Lord from love and in truth is signified by “they shall bow down to Jehovah in the mountain of holiness, at Jerusalem”; “mountain of holiness” signifying the church in respect to the good of love, consequently also the good of love of the church, and “Jerusalem” signifying the church in respect to the truth of doctrine, consequently the truth of doctrine of the church. From this it is evident that “to sound with a horn” signifies Divine truth coming down out of heaven. [7] Because Divine truth coming down from the Lord through the heavens makes the hearts glad and infuses the holiness of worship, and therefore trumpets were sounded on days of gladness and at the feasts, therefore it is said in David: Sing unto Jehovah with the harp; with the harp and the voice of a psalm, with trumpets and the sound of a horn sound before the King Jehovah (Ps. 98:5, 6).

This is said of the state of the church in its beginning; and “stars” signify the knowledges of truth and good, and “the sons of God” Divine truths; the joy of these, that is, of men because of these, is signified by their “singing and sounding.” [8] In David: Praise God with the sound of the horn (Ps. 150:3). Blessed is that people who know the trumpet sound; they shall walk, O Jehovah, in the light of Thy face (Ps. 89:15). “The sound of the horn” signifies Divine truth making the heart glad, therefore it is also said, “in the light of Thy face,” which signifies Divine truth. That “the voices of the horn” and “sounds of trumpets” signify Divine truth coming down out of heaven, and terrifying the evil and dispersing them, as here in Revelation “the trumpets” with which the seven angels sounded, is evident in Isaiah: Jehovah shall go forth as a hero,1 He shall stir up zeal like a man of war, He shall shout [sound] and shall cry out, He shall prevail over His enemies (42:13); “enemies” meaning the evil.

This, too, refers to the Lord’s coming, when the evil are to perish; “to blow the horn” signifies to disperse by means of Divine truth; “the arrow shall go forth as lightning” signifies truth dispersing and destroying. “To blow the horn” has the same signification in Jer. 51:27; Hos. 5:8–9. [10] Because the evil, where they are gathered together in the spiritual world, are deprived by the influx of Divine good and Divine truth of the truths and goods they have simulated in externals, and are let into their evils and falsities which they have inwardly cherished, and are thus separated from the good and cast down into the hells, and because when this takes place there are heard by those at a distance as it were horns and trumpets sounding, as has been said above repeatedly, so with the horns of Israel it was on this account commanded that they should sound with the trumpets for battle; and we read that this was done by Phinehas and by Gideon, in their combats against the Midianites and also at the taking of Jericho. It is said of Phinehas in Moses: That Moses sent twelve thousand men armed, a thousand from each tribe, with the vessels of holiness and the trumpets, in the hand of Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, against Midian; and they slew all the males and their kings (Num. 31:1–8). [11] Of Gideon it is said in the book of Judges: That he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and put a horn in the hand of everyone, and empty pitchers and torches in the midst of the pitchers; and he said, When I blow the horn, I and all that are with me, blow ye also the horn about the whole camp. And when they blew the horns Jehovah set the sword of a man against his companion and against the whole camp, and the Midianites fled (Judg. 7:16–22).

These things represented the overcoming of the evil in the spiritual world, which is effected by Divine truth out of heaven, which is heard there when it flows down as a horn sounding, as was said above. All the miracles related in the Word were representative and thence significative of things Divine in the heavens; therefore the effect of the sound of horns against enemies on earth was like the effect against the evil in the spiritual world; for in the Word “enemies” represented and thence signified the evil, “the Midianites” those who are in the falsities of evil, and the city “Jericho” here the falsification of the knowledges of truth. [12] From this the signification can be seen of the following in Jeremiah: Sound against Babylon round about; she hath given her hand; her foundations are fallen, her walls are torn down (50:15). And in Zephaniah: A day of wasteness and desolation, a day of darkness and of thick darkness, a day of cloud and of gloominess, a day of the horn and of sounding upon the fenced cities, and upon the high corners (1:15, 16). From this it can now be seen what is signified by “the seven angels sounded the trumpets,” and that such effects result therefrom as are here described; and thus that “to sound trumpets” signifies influx of Divine truth out of heaven, and the changes thence arising; for this and the following chapters of Revelation treat of the state of the church in the spiritual world before the judgment, and of the dispersion and casting into hell of the evil. 503a.

[2] This signification of “hail and fire,” as being destroying falsity and evil, is also from the appearances in the spiritual world when Divine truth flows down there out of heaven and flows into the sphere where those are who are in falsities from evil and who are eager to destroy the truths and goods of the church; to those who stand afar off there is then an appearance of a shower of hail and fire, a shower of hail in consequence of their falsities, and a shower of fire from their evils. The reason of this appearance is that when Divine truth flows into the sphere where falsities and evils are, it is changed into something similar to what is in that sphere; for all influx is changed in the recipient subject according to its quality, as with the light of the sun in black subjects, and the heat of the sun in putrid subjects. So it is with Divine truth (which is the light of heaven) and Divine good (which is the heat of heaven) in evil subjects, which are spirits who are in falsities from evil; thence is this appearance. From this it is that “hail and fire” have these significations in the Word; for the sense of the letter of the Word comes for the most part from appearances in the spiritual world. [3] That “hail” signifies infernal falsity destroying the truth of the church is evident elsewhere in the Word, where the destruction of truth is described by “hail”; as in Egypt, when Pharaoh would not let the people of Israel go, which is thus described in Moses: Moses said to Pharaoh that he would cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as had not been in Egypt. There shall be hail upon man and upon beast, and upon every herb of the field in the land of Egypt. And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven; and Jehovah sent voices and hail, and the fire ran along the earth; and Jehovah caused hail to rain upon the land of Egypt; and there was hail, and fire with it, raining in the midst of the very grievous hail. And the hail smote all that was in the field, from man even to beast; and the hail smote every herb of the field, and broke down every tree of the field. Only in the land of"

And the flax and the barley were smitten; for the barley was a ripening ear, and the flax was a stalk. But the wheat and the spelt were not smitten, for these were covered (Exod. 9:18–35). “The hail in Egypt” has a similar signification as the “hail” here in Revelation; for this reason many like things are said; as that “the hail and the fire ran together,” and “the hail smote the herb of the field, and broke down the trees.” Many like things are here mentioned, because the plagues of Egypt and the plagues of Revelation that came when the seven angels sounded have a similar signification; for the “Egyptians” signify merely natural men, the “sons of Israel” spiritual men, the “plagues of Egypt” the changes that precede the Last Judgment, the same as here in Revelation; for the drowning of Pharaoh and the Egyptians in the Red Sea represented the Last Judgment and damnation. This makes clear that here, too, “hail and fire” signify falsities and evils destroying the church. (But those things may be seen explained in Arcana Coelestia, n. 7553–7619.) [4] So “hail” and “coals” (or fire) have a like signification in David: He smote their vine with hail, and their sycamore trees with a grievous hail; and He shut up their beast to the hail, and their herds to the coals. He sent among them the fierceness of His anger, an incursion of evil angels (Ps. 78:47–49). Because “hail” signifies falsity destroying the truths of the church it is said “He smote their vine with hail, and their sycamore trees with a grievous hail,” for “vine” signifies the spiritual truth of the church, and “sycamores” its natural truth; and as “coals” signifies the love of evil and its ardor for destroying the goods of the church, it is said, “He shut up their beast to the hail, and their herds to the coals,” “beast” and “herds” signifying the evil affections or cupidities that arise from evil love, and “coals” the cupidity and ardor for destroying; “an incursion of evil angels” signifies the falsity of evil from hell.

This, too, is said of the “hail of Egypt” which signifies infernal falsity destroying the truths of the church; and the “vine” and the “fig tree” here also signify similar things as the “vine” and the “sycamore trees” above, namely, the “vine” spiritual truth, and the “fig tree” natural truth, each belonging to the church; and “tree” signifies the perceptions and knowledges of truth and good. 503b. [6] “Hail” has a similar signification in Joshua, when Joshua fought against the five kings of the Amorites, of which it is said: It came to pass when the kings fled before Israel, and they were in the going down to Beth-horon, that Jehovah cast down great hailstones from heaven upon them unto Azekah; and more died from the hailstones than the sons of Israel slew with the sword (10:11). As the histories of the Word, the same as the prophecies, are representative and contain an internal sense, therefore also does this that is related of the five kings of the Amorites and the battle of the sons of Israel with them; for the “nations” that were driven out of the land of Canaan signified the evil who are to be cast out of the Lord’s kingdom, and the “sons of Israel” signified those to whom it would be granted to possess the kingdom, for the “land of Canaan” signified heaven and the church, thus the Lord’s kingdom; thence the “five kings of the Amorites” signified those who are in the falsities of evil and who wish to destroy the truths of the good of the church; this is why they were slain by “hailstones out of heaven,” that is, were destroyed and perished by their own falsities of evil; for the evil themselves perish in consequence of their evils and falsities, with which they wish to destroy the truths and goods of the church.

Here “hail and fire” have a similar signification as the “hail and fire” in this passage in Revelation, namely, falsities and evils destroying the truths and goods of the church. It is said that such things are from Jehovah, because Divine truth coming down out of heaven is changed with the evil into infernal falsities, as has been said above; and from this change there spring forth many appearances such as the fall of hail and fire; and yet these things are not out of heaven from the Lord, but from those who are in the falsities of evil, who turn the influx of Divine truth and good into the falsity of evil. It has been granted me to perceive these changes, when Divine truth flowed down out of heaven into some hell. On the way it was successively turned into the falsity of evil, like that which was with them; just as it is with the sun’s heat when it falls into dung heaps, or the sun’s light when it falls into subjects that turn its rays into horrid colors; or when the sun’s light and heat produce in fetid marshy lands noxious plants that nourish serpents, while in good lands they produce trees and grasses that nourish men and useful beasts. The cause that such effects are produced in putrid land is not the light and heat of the sun, but the lands themselves which are such, and yet these effects may be ascribed to the sun’s fire and heat. From this it can be seen what the origin is of the appearances of hail and fire in the spiritual world, and why it is said that “Jehovah causes them to rain,” when yet there is nothing from Jehovah but what is good; and when Jehovah, that is, the Lord, renders the influx powerful, it is not that He may destroy the evil but that He may rescue and protect the good, for He thus conjoins the good to Himself more closely and interiorly, and thus they are separated from the evil, and the evil perish; for if the evil were not separated the good would perish and the angelic heaven would fall to ruin. [8] “Hail” and “the rain of hail” have a similar signification in the following passages. In Isaiah: Woe to the crown of pride, to the drunkards of Ephraim. Behold, the Lord strong and mighty, as an inundation of hail, as a tempest of slaughter (28:1, 2)."

Job is asked by Jehovah about many things, whether he knows them, and the things he is asked about signify such things as belong to heaven and the church; and “Hast thou come to the treasuries of the snow, and hast thou seen the treasuries of the hail?” signifies whether he knows why truth is taken away and is destroyed by the falsities of evil, which in the spiritual world appears like a fall of snow and hail out of the sky there. That there are such appearances when the evil are to be dispersed is signified by “which I keep back against the time of battle and war”; thence it is added, “which is the way in which light is diffused?” This signifies the process by which truth is insinuated, “light” meaning truth. [11] “Hail” signifies the falsity of evil, and “a storm of hail” the destruction of truth, because hail in itself is cold and cannot bear the heat of heaven, and “coldness” signifies the deprivation of the good of love; the good of love is the heat in the angelic heaven (see in the work Heaven and Hell, n. 126–140). Another reason for this meaning is that “stones” in the Word signify truth, and in the contrary sense falsities, and great hail appears to be made up of stones cast down out of heaven, which destroy the crops and herbs of the field, as well as the smaller animals as stones would, and this is why they are called “hailstones.” (That “stones” signify in the Word truths, and in the contrary sense falsities, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 643, 1298, 3720, 6426, 8609, 10376.) 504a. It has been shown thus far what “hail” signifies; it remains to show what “fire” signifies. “Fire” signifies in the Word the good of celestial love, and “flame” the good of spiritual love; but in the contrary sense “fire” signifies the evil arising from the love of self, and “flame” the evil arising from the love of the world. It is to be noted, that all goods whatsoever derive their existence from celestial love and from spiritual love, and that all evils whatsoever derive their existence from the love of self and the love of the world; and as “fire” signifies in the Word love in both senses, so it signifies every good and every evil that springs from either of these loves.

In Ezekiel: I saw, and behold a wind of a tempest came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire infolding itself in itself and a brightness round about it, and as it were the appearance of a living coal in the midst of the fire. Also out of the midst of it a likeness of four animals. The appearance of the animals was like burning coals of fire, and like the appearance of lamps; the same went between the animals, so that the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning. Above the firmament that was over their head was the likeness of a throne, upon which was the appearance of a man. And I saw as it were the appearance of a living coal, as the appearance of fire within it round about, from the appearance of his loins and upward; and from the appearance of his loins and downward I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness round about (1:4, 5, 13, 26, 27; 8:2). “The cherubim” that were seen as animals mean the Lord in respect to Divine Providence and guard that He be not approached except through the good of love; and as this guard itself is in the heavens, and especially in the inmost or third heaven, this heaven is also signified by “the cherubim” (see above, n. 152, 277, 313, 322, 362, 462); and as they especially signify the third heaven, and the Lord is above the heavens, so the Lord was seen “upon a throne above the cherubim.” So, too, the “fire that appeared in the midst of the cherubim, that had brightness round about, and out of which went forth lightning”; also “about the throne and from the loins of Him that sat on the throne, upwards and downwards,” signifies evidently Divine celestial love; for the Lord is Himself Divine love, and whatever proceeds from the Lord proceeds from His Divine love; this therefore is the “fire that had brightness round about it.” [3] Likewise in Daniel:"

His throne is a flame of fire, His wheels a glowing fire; a stream of fire issues and goes forth from Him (7:9, 10, 13). “The Ancient of Days” also means the Lord; here “the Son of man” means the Lord in relation to Divine truth, and “the Ancient of Days” the Lord in relation to Divine good or Divine love, and He is called “the Ancient of Days” from that most ancient time when there was a celestial church, which was in love to the Lord. That church and the heaven of those who were from it are meant by “the throne which was like a flame of fire”; but “the wheels which were like a glowing fire” signify the doctrine of celestial love: the Divine love itself proceeding from the Lord is signified by “the fire issuing and going forth from before Him.” [4] It is also related by Daniel that he saw: A man clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with gold of Uphaz; His body was also like a tharshish stone, and His face as the appearance of lightning, and His eyes as torches of fire, and His arms and His feet like the splendor of brass (Dan. 10:5, 6). That it was the Lord who was thus seen by Daniel is evident from Revelation, where He was represented before John in nearly the same way, of whom it is said: In the midst of the seven lampstands one like unto the Son of man, girt about at the paps with a golden girdle; and His head and hairs white as white wool, as snow; and His eyes as a flame of fire; and His feet like unto burnished brass, as if made glowing in a furnace. His appearance was like the sun (1:13–16; 2:18). From this similarity of the description of “the Son of man” seen by John in the midst of the seven lampstands, and of “the man clothed in linen” and “the Ancient of Days” seen by Daniel, it was evidently the Lord whom they both saw. “His face appeared as lightning and His eyes as a flame of fire” to signify the Lord’s Divine love; for with man the face is a representative image of the affection of his love, and especially the eyes, for from these the love shines forth, from which they sparkle as from fire."

Evidently it was the Lord in respect to the Word who was there represented as sitting upon a white horse, for it is said that He who sat on the white horse is called “the Word of God,” and that He is “King of kings, and Lord of lords.” Because “fire” signifies the Divine love: The Lord was seen by Moses on Mount Horeb in fire in a bush (Exod. 3:1–3). So, too, the Lord was seen “in fire” by Moses and all the Israelitish people when He came down upon Mount Sinai, which is thus described in Moses: And Mount Sinai was altogether on smoke because Jehovah descended upon it in fire, so that the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace (Exod. 19:18; Deut. 4:36). Here, too, the “fire” that was seen represented the Divine love. [6] Because “fire” signifies in the highest sense the Lord’s Divine love, it was commanded that fire should burn continually on the altar, and that they should take of that fire for the incense offerings. It was on this account that the Greeks and Romans had a perpetual fire among their religious observances, of which the vestal virgins had charge. That they worshiped fire as holy was derived from the ancient churches that were in Asia, all things of which worship were representative. Because “fire” signifies in the highest sense the Divine love, a lampstand was placed in the Tent of meeting, on which were seven lamps that burned continually, which is thus described in Moses: Command the sons of Israel that they bring unto thee pure oil of the olive beaten for the light, to cause the lamps to go up continually. Aaron shall order it from evening to morning before Jehovah continually. He shall order the lamps upon the pure lampstand before Jehovah continually (Lev. 24:2–4. Respecting this lampstand itself see Exod. 25:31 to the end; 37:17–24; 40:24, 25; Num. 8:2–4)."

But “the fire of the altar” signified Divine celestial love, and “the fire of the lampstand,” which was a flame, signified Divine spiritual love. From this it is that the “oil,” too, which produced the fire of the flame in the lamps of the lampstand, signifies the Divine love; also the “oil” that the five prudent virgins had in their lamps, and that the five foolish virgins did not have (Matt. 25:1–12). [7] Again “fire” signifies the Lord’s Divine love, in the Gospels: John said, I baptize you with water, but Jesus shall baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire (Matt. 3:11; Luke 3:16). “Baptizing with the Holy Spirit and with fire” signifies the regeneration of man by means of the Divine truth and the Divine good of love from the Lord, the “Holy Spirit” meaning the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord, and “fire” the Divine love from which it springs. [8] The like that is signified by “fire” is also signified by “a place for fire” in Isaiah: Jehovah who hath His place for fire in Zion, and His oven in Jerusalem (31:9). It is said “who hath His place for fire in Zion” because “Zion” signifies the church in which is celestial love; and “His oven in Jerusalem” because “Jerusalem” signifies the church in which is the truth of doctrine; celestial love is comparatively “a place for fire,” and truth of doctrine is like an “oven” in which bread is prepared. 504b. [9] Because the good of love is signified by “fire,” and worship from the good of love was represented by “whole burnt offerings,” sometimes fire was sent down out of heaven and consumed the whole burnt offering; as when a whole burnt offering was made for the expiation of the people, which is thus described in Moses:"

It is also said: That fire from heaven devoured the whole burnt offering of Elijah, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the waters that were round about in the trench (1 Kings 18:38). This “fire” too, signified Divine love, and thence the acceptance of worship from the good of love: Likewise the fire that went up out of the rock, and devoured the flesh and the unleavened cakes that Gideon brought to the angel of God (Judg. 6:21). Again, Divine love was signified by the command: That the lamb should be roasted with fire, and not sodden with water, and that what remained until the morning should be burnt up with fire (Exod. 12:8–10). (For the explanation of these verses see Arcana Coelestia, n. 7852–7861.) [10] Again the Lord’s Divine love was signified by the fire in which the Lord went before the sons of Israel in the wilderness, when they were journeying; also by the fire over the Tent of meeting during the night, which is thus described in Moses: Jehovah went before them by day in a pillar of cloud, to lead them in the way, and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light; neither the pillar of cloud by day nor the pillar of fire by night departed from before the people (Exod. 13:21, 22; Num. 9:15–23; Deut. 1:33).

Lest they might be hurt by too much light they were guarded by a cloud, and from being hurt by too much shade they were guarded by a shining fire. [11] That such was represented thereby can be seen in Isaiah: Jehovah will create over every dwelling place of Mount Zion and over her convocations a cloud by day and a smoke and the brightness of a flame of fire by night; for over all the glory shall be a covering. And there shall be a covert for a shade in the daytime from the heat, and for a shelter and hiding place from inundation and from rain (4:5, 6). “The dwelling place of Mount Zion” signifies the good of the celestial church, and “her convocations” signify the truths of that good; protection lest it be hurt by too much light and by too much shade is signified by “a cloud by day,” and by “a smoke and the brightness of a flame of fire by night”; therefore it is said “over all the glory shall be a covering,” and that “there shall be a covert for a shade in the daytime from the heat.” Lest falsities should break in because of too much light or too much shade is signified by “it shall be for a shelter and a hiding place from the inundation and from rain,” “inundation and rain” meaning a breaking in of falsities.

[13] Because the Word is Divine truth itself united to Divine good, for everywhere in it there is a marriage of good and truth, therefore: Elijah was seen to ascend up into heaven by a chariot of fire and horses of fire (2 Kings 2:11). For the same reason the mountain was seen to be full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha (2 Kings 6:17). For Elijah and Elisha represented the Lord in relation to the Word; therefore the “chariot” signified doctrine from the Word, and “the horses” the understanding of the Word. [14] Again, that “fire” signifies love is evident in David: Jehovah maketh His angels spirits, His ministers a flaming fire (Ps. 104:4). That “He maketh angels spirits” signifies that He makes them recipients of Divine truths, consequently Divine truths; and that “He makes His ministers a flaming fire” signifies that He makes them recipients of Divine good, consequently Divine goods. (That “angels” mean in the Word the Lord in relation to Divine truth, and in a relative sense, recipients of Divine truth from the Lord, see above, n. 130, 200, 302; and that “ministers” signify recipients of the Divine good which is of Divine love, see also above, n. 155.) From this it is clear that “a flaming fire” signifies the good of love. “Fire” signifies love, because the Lord from Divine love appears in the angelic heaven as a sun, from which sun heat and light proceed; and in the heavens heat from the Lord as a sun is the Divine good"

(That the Lord from Divine love appears in the angelic heaven as a sun may be seen in the work Heaven and Hell, n. 116–125; and that light from that sun is Divine truth, and heat from that sun is Divine good, n. 126–140; also n. 567, 568.) It is from the correspondence between fire and love that in ordinary language, in speaking of the affections that belong to love, the expressions “to grow hot,” “to burn,” “to glow,” “to boil,” “to be on fire,” and others of like meaning are used. Moreover, man grows warm from love of any kind, according to its degree. 504c. [15] So far respecting the signification of “fire” in the Word, when it is attributed to the Lord, or when it is predicated of heaven and the church. But when “fire” is predicated in the Word of the evil and of the hells, it signifies the love of self and of the world, and thence every evil affection and cupidity that torments the wicked after death in the hells. “Fire” has this contrary signification for the reason that Divine love, when it comes down out of heaven and falls into the societies where the evil are, is changed into a love contrary to the Divine love, and thus into various heats of cupidity and of lusts, and so into evils of every kind, and also into torments, because evils carry with them the punishments of evil. From this change of the Divine love into infernal love with the evil, the hells where the love of self and the world and hatreds and revenge prevail, appear to be as if on fire, both within and round about, although the infernal crew that is in them perceive nothing fiery. Indeed, from these loves the crew that is in such hells appear with faces inflamed and reddened as from fire. [16] This, therefore, is the signification of “fire” in the following passages. In Isaiah: Wickedness shall burn as a fire; it shall devour the briars and brambles, and shall kindle the thickets of the forest, that they may roll upward in the elation of smoke. And the people are become as food of the fire; a man shall not pity his brother (9:18, 19). The whole people shall be for the burning, food for fire (9:5)."

In these passages, “fire” signifies all cupidity belonging to the love of evil, and its punishment, which is torment. To this may be added what is presented in the work Heaven and Hell (n. 566–575), where it is shown what is meant by “infernal fire” and by “the gnashing of teeth.” 504d. [18] In the article above, in which “hail” was treated of, it was said that the Divine, when it comes down out of heaven into the lower sphere where the evil are, presents an effect which is the opposite of its effect in heaven itself; that is, in heaven it vivifies and conjoins, but in the lower parts where the evil are it produces death and disjunction. This is because the Divine influx out of heaven opens, in the good, the spiritual mind, and fits it to receive; but in the evil, who have no spiritual mind, it opens the interiors of their natural mind, where evils and falsities reside, and from this they then have an aversion to every good of heaven, and hatred for truths, and a lust for every crime, and in consequence they are separated from the good, and then damned. This influx with the good, of which we are now speaking, appears in the heavens as a fire vivifying, recreating, and conjoining; but below with the evil, it appears as a devouring and wasting fire. [19] It is because of this effect of the Divine love flowing down out of heaven, that in the Word anger and wrath are so often attributed to Jehovah, that is, to the Lord, anger from fire, and wrath from the heat of fire; there is also the expression “the fire of His anger,” and that “He is a consuming fire,” with many other like expressions, which do not mean that the fire proceeding from the Lord is such, for in its origin it is Divine love, but that it becomes such with the evil, who by reason of its flowing into them become angry and wrathful. That this is so can be seen from the fire that appeared on Mount Sinai, when the Lord descended upon it and promulgated the law; this fire, although in its origin it was Divine love and the source of Divine truth, appeared to the Israelitish people as a consuming fire, before which they trembled greatly.

In Isaiah: Behold, Jehovah will come in fire and His chariots like a storm, in flames of fire.

Jehovah thundered out of the heavens, and the Most High gave forth His voice, hail and coals of fire (Ps. 18:8, 12, 13). Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence; a fire shall devour before Him (Ps. 50:3). Jehovah shall rain upon the wicked snares, fire, and brimstone (Ps. 11:6). In Ezekiel: I will set My faces against them, that although they go out from the fire yet the fire shall devour them. And I will make the land a waste, because they have committed trespasses (15:4, 6–8)."

And as the fire that comes down out of heaven, which in its origin is Divine love, becomes, when it is received by the evil there, a consuming fire, in the Word such fire is predicated of Jehovah. Infernal fire has no other source than the change of the Divine love into evil loves, and into direful cupidities of doing evil and inflicting injury. [21] This was represented also by: The fire that fell from heaven and consumed Sodom and Gomorrah (Gen. 19:24); And the fire that consumed Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, because they offered incense with strange fire (Lev. 10:1, et seq.). “Incense offered with strange fire” signifies worship from other love than love to the Lord.

So again it is said in Isaiah: The light of Israel shall be for a fire, and his Holy One for a flame, and it shall burn and consume his briers and brambles in one day (10:17). “Briers and brambles” signify the evils and falsities of the doctrine of the church; the destruction of these by Divine truth descending out of heaven is signified by “the light of Israel shall be for a fire, and his Holy One for a flame.” 504e.

This signifies in the spiritual sense that a doctrine from which is worship that acknowledges any other god than the Lord must be destroyed, because in such doctrine there is nothing but falsities from evil cupidities. This is signified in the spiritual sense by these words, because a “city” in the Word signifies doctrine, and “to serve other gods” signifies to acknowledge and worship some other god than the Lord; “sword” signifies the destruction of truth by falsity, and “fire” the destruction of good by evil. [31] In Luke: The Lord said that He came to send fire on the earth; and what would He if it were already kindled? (12:49); which signifies hostilities and combats between good and evil, and between truth and falsity; for before the Lord came into the world there were in the church nothing but falsities and evils, consequently there was no combat between these and truths and goods; but when truths and goods had been unveiled by the Lord, then it was possible for combats to exist, and without combats between these there can be no reformation; this therefore is what is meant by the Lord’s “willing that fire be already kindled.” That this is the meaning of these words can be seen from those that follow:"

[32] As “sons” signify in the Word the truths of the church, and “daughters” its goods, it can be seen what is signified by “burning sons and daughters” in Jeremiah: They have built the high places of Topheth, in the valley of Hinnom, for burning their sons and their daughters (7:31). I will cause an alarm of war to be heard against Rabbah of Ammon; and her daughters shall be burned with fire (49:2).

In Joel: The day of Jehovah, a day of darkness and of thick darkness; a fire devoureth before it, and after it a flame burneth (2:1–3). And I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke. The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and fearful day of Jehovah cometh (2:30, 31). The fire hath devoured the habitations of the desert, and the flame hath set in flames all the trees of the field (1:19, 20). In Ezekiel: Say to the forest of the south, Behold, I will kindle a fire in thee, and it shall devour every green tree in thee; the flame of the grievous flame shall not be quenched; wherefore all the faces from the south even to the north shall be burned therein (20:46, 47). “The forest of the south” signifies a church that can be in the light of truth from the Word, but that is now in knowledges alone without spiritual light; “the trees that the fire will devour” signify such knowledges; that evil cupidities will deprive such knowledges of all spiritual life, and that there will be no longer any truth in clearness, nor even a remnant of it in obscurity, is signified by “all the faces (of the land) from the south to the north shall be burned therein.” Now that the signification of “fire” in both senses is known, the signification in the Word of “to become warm,” “to be inflamed,” “to glow,” “to boil up,” “to be burned,” “to be burnt up,” also of “warmth,” “flame,” “glow,” “burning,” “conflagration,” “place for fire,” “coals,” and the like, can be seen. 505.

This signifies progression towards the lower parts, because the changes and desolations that are signified by “the third part of the trees and all the green grass were burnt up,” were effected progressively towards the lower parts where the evil were, as has been said above. “The earth” means here the lower parts, because these things were seen by John when he was in the spirit, that is, when he was in the spiritual world; for man’s spirit, when it has its sight opened, sees the things that are in the spiritual world and in that world there are mountains, hills, and valleys, and upon the mountains and hills there are the angelic heavens, but in the valleys below are those who have not yet been taken up into heaven; on these, therefore, there were now the evil mixed with the good; wherefore these valleys that were below the mountains and hills are here meant by “the earth” (or land); so “to be cast unto the earth” means out of the heavens towards the lower parts. But when mountains, hills, and valleys taken together are called “the earth,” then “the earth” signifies the church there. 506.

[2] “The third part” signifies all, and thus “the third part of the trees” signifies every perception of truths and goods, and thence every knowledge of them, because the number “three” signifies fullness, the whole, and all, and is predicated of truths; so “the third part” has the like meaning, for “a third” means the same as “three”; moreover, numbers multiplied into themselves and divided"

[3] This describes how all perception of truth and good, and thence the knowledge of them, were first destroyed by the loves of self and the world and the cupidities and pleasures arising therefrom. The perception and knowledge of spiritual truth and good are destroyed by these loves and the cupidities arising therefrom, because these loves are the corporeal and merely natural loves into which man is born and unless these are subdued and ruled by spiritual loves, which are out of heaven from the Lord, they extinguish every perception and thence every knowledge of the truths and goods of heaven and the church; for these loves regarded in themselves are diametrically opposite to the spiritual loves. From this it can be seen that when the church lapses it comes first from an internal spiritual state into a natural state, that consists of loving self and the world above all things; thence then it is in thick darkness in respect to all things of heaven and the church, however much light it may have in respect to the things of the world. [4] When the perception of spiritual truths and goods perishes, the knowledge of them also perishes, for although man knows them and speaks of them from the Word or from doctrine, still he does not know them when he does not perceive them.

And all green grass was burnt up, signifies that all true knowledge (scientificum) was destroyed by the cupidities of the same loves. This is evident from the signification of “grass,” as being knowledge (of which presently); also from the signification of “green,” as being truth and living from truth, because as green grass serves as food for animals, so true knowledge serves for spiritual nourishment for man; for whatever is produced in fields, in gardens, and in plains, and serves for nourishment either for man or beast, has a correspondence with such things as serve for the nourishment of the spirit and mind, and such nourishment is called spiritual nourishment. Like things appear in the spiritual world, from the correspondence of spiritual things with natural things; and as the Word in the letter is natural, and is written by correspondences, it is here said that “the third part of the trees and all green grass were burnt up,” which means in the spiritual sense that all perception and knowledge of truth and good, as well as all true knowledge are destroyed, by these two corporeal, terrestrial, and merely natural loves. [2] By true knowledge is meant all knowledge by which spiritual truth is confirmed, and which has life from spiritual good. For by knowledges a man may become wise or he may become insane. A man becomes wise by knowledges when he uses them to confirm the truths and goods of the church, which are spiritual truths and goods; and he becomes insane by knowledges when he uses them to invalidate and refute the truths and goods of the church. When they are used to confirm the truths and goods of the church they are called true knowledges, as also living knowledges; but when they are used to invalidate and refute the truths and goods of the church they are called false knowledges, and also dead knowledges.

All intelligence and wisdom is from truths that are from heaven; such intelligence and wisdom, because it is from heaven, that is, from the Lord through heaven, is living, because it is the very spiritual life of man; but from falsities there can be no intelligence and wisdom, and if it is supposed to exist in anyone, yet it is dead, because it is from hell. [3] This has been said to make known that “green grass” signifies true knowledge (scientificum), which is living, but “grass burnt up” signifies false knowledge, which is dead. When truth and good, which come from heaven, find no receptacle in the cognitions and knowledges with man, but evils and falsities which are from hell are received, then knowledges are not living but dead, and correspond to grass withered and burnt up. It is similar with man himself, for a man is such a man as the cognitions and knowledges are alive in him; for from living knowledges he has intelligence, but from knowledges not living he has no intelligence; and if they are dead in consequence of the confirmation of falsities by them there is insanity and folly. [4] Such a man, from correspondence, is compared in the Word to “grass,” and is also called “grass” in the following passages.

As for man, his days are as grass; as a flower of the field so he flourisheth (Ps. 103:15).

This is said of the Lord’s coming, and of the revelation of Divine truth from Him at that time, which is meant by “the glory of Jehovah shall be revealed, and they shall see.” That there will then be no true knowledge (scientificum) and no spiritual truth with men, is signified by “all flesh is grass, all its holiness is as the flower of the field; the grass hath dried up, the flower hath fallen off,” “grass” meaning true knowledge, and “the flower of the field” spiritual truth.

All self- intelligence is from the love of self. [2] “Mountain” means love in both senses, because the angels of the third heaven, who are in celestial love, dwell upon mountains in the spiritual world; so when a “mountain” is mentioned, that heaven is meant, and according to the ideas of angelic thought, which are abstracted from persons and places, that which constitutes heaven is meant, that is, celestial love. But in the contrary sense “mountain” signifies the love of self, because they who are in the love of self have a constant desire to go up mountains, to make themselves equal to those who are in the third heaven. Because they dwell upon this in their fancy, it is also the object of their endeavor when they are out of the hells; this is why a “mountain” in the contrary sense signifies the love of self. In a word, those who are in the love of self are always aspiring after high things, so after death, when all the states of the love are changed into things correspondent, in their fancy they mount aloft, believing themselves, while in the fancy, to be upon high mountains, and yet bodily they are in the hells. This is why those who are of Babylon, who are in such love of self as to wish to rule not only over all the earth but also over the heavens, are called “mountains,” and are said “to sit upon a mountain” and “to ascend above the heights of the cloud.” As in Jeremiah: Behold, I am against thee, O destroying mountain, destroying the whole earth; and I will stretch out My hand against thee, to roll thee down from the rocks and make thee a mountain of burning (51:25). In Isaiah: Thou hast said in thy heart, I will ascend into the heavens, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God; and I will sit on the mount of the congregation; I will ascend above the heights of the cloud; I will become like the Most High: yet thou shalt be cast down to hell (14:13–15).

This is evident from the signification of the “sea,” as being the knowledge (scientificum) in general which is in the natural man, consequently the natural man in respect to its knowledge there (see above n. 270, 342b ). This is the signification of “sea,” because “water” signifies truth, and truth in the natural man is called knowledge; but truth itself is in itself spiritual, and in the spiritual man makes one with the affection of truth, for it is a form of affection there; consequently so far as this affection with its form is therefrom in the knowledges that are in the natural man, so far the knowledges contain in themselves truths, and are true knowledges; for the knowledges of the natural man, viewed in themselves, are not truths, but only containing vessels of truth, therefore “vessels” in the Word signify knowledges. [2] That the “sea” signifies the natural man can be seen from passages in the Word cited above (n. 275, 342b, c), which makes clear that the “sea” in reference to its water signifies knowledge in general, while the “sea” in reference to its waves signifies disputation and reasoning, which are maintained by knowledges; and as both knowledges and reasoning are in the natural man, therefore the “sea” signifies the natural man itself. But the state of the natural man is wholly in accordance with the affection of man’s love. When spiritual affection, that is, affection of good and truth for the sake of good and truth, is dominant in man, and when this affection flows in through the spiritual into the natural man, then the natural man is a spiritual-natural man, for it is subordinate and subject to the spiritual, and as they thus act as a one, both are in heaven. But so long as a merely natural affection is dominant in man, there is in the natural man no truth, but everything therein is knowledge not true, it is dead knowledge and false knowledge, for the reason that the knowledges therein then conjoin themselves with affections merely natural, all of which spring from the loves of self and of the world, while truths themselves, because in themselves they are spiritual, conjoin themselves only with spiritual affections, as has been said above. When truths conjoin themselves with affections merely natural, they are no longer truths but falsities, for affection merely natural falsifies truths.

There are seas there because in the boundaries of heaven and beyond them those dwell who have been merely natural men, and these appear there in deep places, where they have their abodes; the natural men there, however, are not evil, but the evil natural men are in the hells. The seas there seen also make evident what those are who are in them, especially from the color of the waters, as verging towards darkness or clearness; if towards darkness those therein are sensual spirits, who are the lowest natural, and if towards clearness those therein are the interior natural. But the waters of the seas that are over the hells are dense, black, and sometimes ruddy; and the infernal crew therein appear like snakes and serpents, and like such monsters as are in seas. 512.

From this alone it can be seen that the love of self is more gross and foully corporeal than any other love, and consequently that it takes away all spiritual perception, which is a perception of the truth and good of heaven and the church. Moreover, it shuts up the spiritual mind and fixes its seat entirely in the natural and sensual man, which communicates most closely with the body and has no communication with heaven. From this again it comes to pass that all those in whom the love of self is dominant are sensual, and do not see the things that belong to heaven and the church except in the densest darkness; and furthermore they reject and deny these whenever they are alone and are thinking with themselves.

For all the ideas of the thought of angels and spirits are turned into various representatives outside of them; when turned into such things as are of the vegetable kingdom they are turned into trees and shrubs of various kinds; and when into such things as are of the animal kingdom they are turned into land animals and flying things of various kinds; when the ideas of the angels of heaven are turned into land animals they are turned into lambs, sheep, goats, bullocks, horses, mules, and other like animals; but when into flying things they are turned into turtle doves, pigeons, and various kinds of beautiful birds. But the ideas of thought of those who are natural and who think from mere knowledges are turned into the forms of fishes. Consequently in the seas various kinds of fishes appear, and this it has often been granted me to see. [3] It is from this that in the Word “fishes” signify knowledges, as in the following passages. In Isaiah: At My rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers into a wilderness; their fish shall rot because there is no water, and shall die of thirst (50:2). “The rebuke of Jehovah” means the ruin of the church, which takes place when there is no knowledge of truth and good, that is, no living knowledge, because there is no perception; “dry up the sea” signifies to deprive the natural man of true knowledges and thus of natural life from the spiritual; “to make the rivers into a wilderness” signifies a similar deprivation in the rational man whence there is no intelligence; “their fish shall rot because there is no water, and shall die of thirst,” signifies that there is no longer any living knowledge, because there is no truth, “fish” meaning knowledge, “water” truth, and “to rot” meaning to perish in respect to spiritual life."

It is said of this in David: He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish (Ps. 105:29). The like was done in Egypt, because “Egypt” signifies the natural man in respect to its knowledge, or the knowledge belonging to the natural man; “the river of Egypt” signifies intelligence acquired by means of knowledges; “the river becoming blood” signifies intelligence from mere falsities; “the fish dying” signifies that true knowledges were destroyed by falsities, for knowledges live by truths but are destroyed by falsities, for the reason that all spiritual truth is living, and from it is all the life, or as it were the soul, in the knowledges; therefore without spiritual truth knowledge is dead. [5] In Ezekiel: I am against thee, Pharaoh, king of Egypt, the great whale that lieth in the midst of his rivers, that hath said, My river is mine own, and I have made myself. Therefore I will put hooks in thy jaws, and I will cause the fish of thy rivers to stick unto thy scales, and I will bring thee up out of the midst of thy rivers, that all the fish of thy rivers may stick unto thy scales. And I will abandon thee in the wilderness, thee and all the fish of thy rivers (29:3–5). “Pharaoh” has a similar signification as “Egypt,” for the king and the people have a similar signification, namely, the natural man and knowledge therein; therefore he is called “a great whale,” “whale” (or sea monster) signifying knowledge in general; therefore it is said that “he shall be drawn out of the river,” and that then “the fish"

In the sensual man, which is the lowest natural, standing out nearest to the world, there are fallacies and falsities therefrom, and this is signified by “the fish sticking to the scales” of the whale. That the natural man and the knowledge therein will be without life from any intelligence is signified by “I will abandon thee in the wilderness, thee and all the fish of thy rivers.” That such things would come to pass because the natural man attributes all intelligence to itself, is signified by “that hath said, My river is mine own, I have made myself,” “river” meaning intelligence. [6] In Moses: The sons of Israel said in the wilderness, We remember the fish that we did eat in Egypt freely, and the cucumbers and the melons, and the leeks and the onions and the garlic; now our soul is dried up; there is nothing at all except this manna before our eyes. Afterwards there went forth a wind from Jehovah, and snatched quails from the sea, and let them fall over the camp. But because of this lust Jehovah smote the people with a very great plague; consequently the name of that place was called the Graves of Lust (Num. 11:5, 6, 31, 33, 34). This signified that the sons of Israel were averse from things spiritual and hungered after natural things; indeed, they were not spiritual but merely natural, only representing a spiritual church by external things. That they were averse from spiritual things is signified by “our soul is dried up, there is nothing at all except this manna before our eyes,” “manna” signifying spiritual food, which is knowledge (scientia), intelligence, and wisdom. That they hungered after natural things is signified by “their lusting after the fish in Egypt, the cucumbers, the melons, the leeks, the onions, and the garlic,” all which signify such things as belong to the lowest natural, that is, the sensual-corporeal man; and because they rejected things spiritual, and coveted merely natural things instead, “they were smitten with a great plague, and the name given to the place was the Graves of Lust.” [7] In Ezekiel:"

This treats of the house of God, which signifies heaven and the church; and “the waters that go forth out of the house of God towards the east” signify Divine truth reforming and regenerating; the “plain” and the “sea” into which the waters go down, signify the ultimate things of heaven and the church, which with the men of the church are the things that belong to the natural and sensual man, the “plain” signifying the interior things thereof, and the “sea” the exterior things thereof; that both cognitions from the Word and confirming knowledges receive spiritual life through this Divine truth is signified by “the waters of the sea are healed thereby,” and by “every soul that creepeth shall live,” and by “there shall be exceeding much fish”; that there are in consequence true and living knowledges of every kind is signified by “their fish shall be according to their kind, as the fish of the great sea, exceeding many.” Those who are reformed, and thence become intelligent, are meant by “the fishers from En-gedi even to En-eglaim.” Those who cannot be reformed because they are in the falsities of evil are signified by “the miry places and marshes that are not healed, but are given to salt.” Everyone can see that this does not mean that fishes are multiplied by the waters going forth out of the house of God, but that “fishes” mean such things in man as can be reformed, since “the house of God” means heaven and the church, and the “waters going forth therefrom” mean Divine truth reforming. 513b.

Therefore the land shall mourn, and everyone that dwelleth therein shall languish, among the beasts of the field, and among the fowl of the heavens; and also the fishes of the sea shall be gathered up (4:1, 3). In Zephaniah: I will consume man and beast, I will consume the fowl of the heavens, and the fishes of the sea, and the stumbling blocks with the wicked (1:3). In Ezekiel: In the day that Gog shall come upon the land of Israel, there shall be a great earthquake over the land of Israel, and the fishes of the sea, and the fowl of the heavens, and the beast of the field, shall quake before Me (38:18–20).

That He has dominion over angels in the heavens and over men on the earth is known from the Word, for He says that unto Him “all power in heaven and in earth has been given” (Matt. 28:18); but that dominion was given to Him over animals, fowl, and fishes, is not a matter of sufficient importance to be mentioned in the Word, where each and every thing has reference to heaven and the church. It is therefore evident that “flock and herds, the beasts of the fields, the fowl of heaven, and the fish of the sea,” mean such things as belong to heaven with angels and to the church with man, “the flock and the herds” signifying, in general, things spiritual and natural, the “flock” things spiritual, and “herds” things natural that are with man, or that belong to the spiritual mind and to the natural mind with him. “The beasts of the fields” signify things voluntary, which belong to the affections; “the fowl of heaven” signify things intellectual, which belong to the thoughts; and “the fishes of the sea” signify knowledges (scientifica) which belong to the natural man. [10] Like things are signified by these words in the first chapter of Genesis: And God said, We will make man in Our image, after Our likeness; that he may have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of heaven, and over every animal that creepeth upon the earth (verses 26, 28). This chapter treats in the internal spiritual sense of the establishment of the most ancient church, thus of the new creation or regeneration of the men of that church. That it was given to them to perceive all things of their affection which belong to the will, and to see all things of their thought which belong to the understanding, and to so rule over them as not to wander away into the lusts of evil and into falsities, is meant by “that he may have dominion over the fish of the sea, and the fowl of heaven, and every animal of the earth”; and man has dominion over these things when the Lord has dominion over man, for man of himself"

The correspondences of the interior things of man with these things stand forth so as to be clearly seen in the spiritual world; for there beasts of every kind, and birds, and fishes in the seas, are seen, which nevertheless are nothing else than the ideas of thought that flow forth from affections, and these are presented under such forms because they are correspondences. 513c. [11] Because “fishes” signify the knowledges and cognitions belonging to the natural man that serve the spiritual man as means for becoming wise, so “fishers” mean in the Word those who are merely in knowledges, also those who are acquiring knowledges for themselves, also those who teach others and by means of knowledges reform them. The works of such are meant by “the casting and spreading of nets,” as in the following passages. In Isaiah: The fishers shall moan, and all they that cast the hook into the river shall mourn, and they that spread the net upon the faces of the waters shall languish (19:8). “The fishers that cast the hook into the river and they that spread the net” mean those who wish to acquire for themselves knowledges and through these intelligence, here that they are unable to do this because there are no knowledges of truth anywhere. [12] In Jeremiah: I will bring back the sons of Israel again upon their land; I will send to many fishers who shall fish them; then I will send to many hunters, who shall hunt them from upon every mountain and from upon every hill, and out of the clefts of the cliffs (16:15, 16). “To send to fishers who shall fish them, and to hunters who shall hunt them,” means to call together and establish the church with those who are in natural good and in spiritual good, as may be seen above (n. 405c)."

Let him draw up all with the hook, and gather him into his net. Shall he therefore empty his net, and not pity to slay the nations continually? (1:14, 15, 17). This was said of the Chaldean nation wasting and destroying the church; and the Chaldean nation signifies the profanation of truth, and the vastation of the church. “To make men as the fishes of the sea, and as the creeping thing that hath no ruler,” signifies to make man so natural that his knowledges (scientifica) are devoid of spiritual truth, and his delights are devoid of spiritual good; for in the natural man there are knowledges by which come thoughts, and delights by which come affections; and if the spiritual is not dominant over these, both thoughts and affections are wandering, and thus man is destitute of the intelligence that should lead and rule. That then every falsity and every evil has power to draw them over to their side, and thus wholly destroy them, is signified by “Let him draw out all with the hook, and gather into his net, and afterwards slay,” “to draw out” meaning out of truth and good, “into his net” meaning into falsity and evil, and “to slay” meaning to destroy. [14] In Amos: The days will come in which they shall draw you out with hooks, and your posterity with fish hooks (4:2). This signifies leading away and alienating from truths by means of acute reasonings from falsities and fallacies; it is said of those who abound in knowledges because they have the Word and the prophets; such are here meant by “the kine of Bashan in the mountain of Samaria.” [15] From this the meaning of “fishermen,” “fishes” and “nets,” so often mentioned in the New Testament, can be seen, as in the following passages:"

And He said unto them, Come ye after Me, and I will make you fishers of men (Matt. 4:18, 19: Mark 1:16, 17). Jesus entered into Simon’s boat and was teaching the multitude. After that He told Simon to let out his nets for a draught, and they inclosed a great multitude of fishes, so that the boats were filled, and in danger of sinking. And amazement seized them all, because of the draught of fishes; and He said unto Simon, Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch men (Luke 5:3–10). In this also there is a spiritual sense, like that in the rest of the Word; the Lord’s choosing these fishermen and saying that “they should become fishers of men,” signified that they should gather to the church; “the nets which they let out, and in which they inclosed a great multitude of fishes, so that the ships were in danger of sinking,” signified the reformation of the church through them, for “fishes” here signify the knowledges of truth and good by means of which reformation is effected, likewise the multitude of men who are to be reformed. [16] The draught of fishes by the disciples after the Lord’s resurrection has a like signification; it is thus described in John: When Jesus manifested Himself to the disciples, who were fishing, He told them to cast the net on the right side of the boat. And they took so many that they were not able to draw the net for the multitude of fishes. When they descended upon the land they saw a fire built, and a little fish lying thereon, and bread. And Jesus gave them the bread, and the little fish likewise (21:2–13). The Lord manifested Himself while they were fishing, because “to fish” signified to teach the knowledges of truth and good, and thus to reform. His commanding them “to cast the net on the right side of the boat” signified that all things should be from the good of love and charity, “the right side” signifying that good from which all things should come, for so far as knowledges are derived from good, so far they live and are multiplied. They said that “they had labored all the night and had taken nothing,” which signified that from self or from one’s own (proprium) nothing comes, but that all things are from the Lord; and the like was signified by the “fire” on"

At that time there were no spiritual men, because the church was wholly vastated, but all were natural, and their reformation was represented by this fishing, and also by the fish on the fire. He who believes that the fish on the fire and the bread that were given to the disciples to eat were not significative of something higher is very much mistaken, for the least things done by the Lord and said by Him were significative of Divine celestial things, which become evident only through the spiritual sense. That this “fire of coals” and “fire” mean the good of love, and that “bread” means the Lord in relation to that good, has been shown above; and that a “fish” means the knowledge of truth and the knowing faculty of the natural man is clear from what has been said and shown in this article. 513d. [ 17] It is also said by the Lord that: The kingdom of the heavens is like unto a net cast into the sea bringing together every kind of fish, which when it was full they drew upon the beach, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away. So shall it be in the consummation of the age (Matt. 13:47–49). The separation of the good and the evil is here likened to “a net cast into the sea bringing together every kind of fish,” for the reason that “fishes” signify natural men in respect to knowledges and cognitions, and in “the consummation of the age,” or at the time of the Last Judgment, such are separated from one another; for there are good natural men and bad natural men; and the separation of these in the spiritual world has the appearance of a net or dragnet cast into the sea, bringing together the fish, and drawing them to the shore, and this appearance is also from correspondence. This is why the Lord likens the kingdom of the heavens to “a net bringing together the fish.” That the separation of the good from the evil presents this appearance it has been granted me to see.

Jesus said unto him, Therefore are the sons free. But lest we cause them to stumble, go thou to the sea and cast a hook, and take up the fish that first cometh up, and open its mouth and thou shalt find a shekel; that take and give unto them for Me and thee (Matt. 17:24–27). “To pay tribute and toll,” signified to be subject and to serve, therefore tribute was imposed on strangers, who were not of the sons of Israel, as is evident from the histories of the Word. “The sons of Israel,” with whom was the church, signified the spiritual, and “strangers” the natural; and what is natural is subject to what is spiritual and serves it, for the spiritual man is like a lord, and the natural man like a servant; and as the natural are servants, and are therefore meant by those who pay tribute, so it was brought about that neither the Lord nor Peter, but the “fish,” which signified the natural man, should furnish the tribute. [19] The Lord’s glorification of His Human, even to its ultimate, which is called natural and sensual, is signified by the following: Jesus, having appeared to the disciples, said, See My hands and My feet, that it is I myself; feel of Me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones as ye behold Me having. And He showed them the hands and feet. And He said unto them, Have ye here anything to eat? They gave Him a piece of a broiled fish and of a honeycomb. And He took it and did eat before them (Luke 24:38–43). That the Lord glorified His Human even to its ultimate, which is called the natural and sensual, He made manifest by showing the hands and feet, and by the disciples feeling them, and by His saying that “a spirit hath not flesh and bones as He had”; and by His eating of the broiled fish and honeycomb. “Hands and feet” signify the ultimates of man, likewise “flesh and bones”; and “broiled fish” signifies the natural in respect to truth from good, and “honey” the natural in respect to the good from which is truth. Because these corresponded to the natural man, and thence signified it, they were eaten in the presence of the disciples; for a “fish,” as has been shown in this article, signifies from correspondence the natural in respect to knowing (scientificum); wherefore also “a fish” signifies in the Word knowledge and the knowing faculty (scientificum et"

One who does not know that in each particular of the Word there is a spiritual sense, and that the sense of the letter, which is the natural sense, consists of correspondences with things spiritual, cannot know this arcanum, namely, why the Lord ate of the broiled fish and honeycomb in the presence of His disciples, nor why, as here, He gave broiled fish and bread to His disciples; and yet each and every thing that the Lord said and did was Divine, and these Divine things lie hidden in each thing written in the Word. [20] From this the signification of “there died the third part of the creatures in the sea having souls” can now be seen, namely, that every living knowledge in the natural man perished; or, what is the same, that the natural man in respect to knowledges therein died. The natural man is said to be dead when it is not made alive from the spiritual man, that is, by influx out of heaven from the Lord through the spiritual man, for the Lord flows in through the spiritual man into the natural. When, therefore, no truth of heaven is any longer acknowledged, and no good of heaven affects man, the spiritual mind, which is called the spiritual man, is closed up, and the natural mind receives mere falsities from evil, and falsities from evil are spiritually dead, since truths from good are what are spiritually alive. [21] It is said “the third part of the creatures,” because “creatures” and “animals” signified in the Word the affections and thoughts therefrom in man; consequently they mean men themselves in respect to affections and thoughts. Such is the signification of “creatures” in Mark: Jesus said to the disciples, Going into all the world, preach ye the Gospel to every creature (16:15). Also above in Revelation:"

And the third part of the ships was destroyed, signifies that also all the knowledges from the Word, and from doctrines from the Word perished. This is evident from the signification of “the third part,” as being everything, here all, because it is predicated of the knowledges of truth and good; also from the signification of “ships,” as being the knowledges of truth and good, also doctrinals. “Ships” have this signification because they carry riches over the sea for traffic, and “riches” signify in the Word the knowledges of truth and good, which also are doctrinals. “Ships,” in a strict sense, as being containing vessels, signify the Word and doctrine from the Word, because the Word and doctrine therefrom contain the knowledges of truth and good, as ships contain riches; and “trading,” which is chiefly done by ships, signifies acquiring knowledges for oneself and communicating them to others. But when the contents rather than the contained are meant, “ships” signify the knowledges from the Word and from doctrine from the Word. [2] This signification of “ships” is evident from the passages where they are mentioned in the Word. Thus in Ezekiel: O Tyre, thy borders are in the heart of the seas, thy builders have perfected thy beauty. They have built for thee all thy planks of fir trees from Senir; they have taken a cedar from Lebanon to make a mast for thee. Of the oaks of Bashan have they made thine oars; they have made thy benches of ivory, a daughter of steps from the isles of Kittim. The inhabitants of Zidon and Arvad were thy rowers; thy wise men, O Tyre, that were in thee, they were thy shipmasters. The elders of Gebal and the wise men thereof were in thee caulking thy breaches; all the ships of the sea with their mariners were in thee to trade in thy merchandise. The ships of Tarshish served as carriers for thy wares. Thou wast filled and glorified exceedingly in the heart of the seas (27:4–6, 8, 9, 25)."

But it would take too much space to explain here what all these particulars signify in the spiritual sense; it is enough to say that it is evident from this that a “ship” signifies doctrine from the Word, and that its “planks,” “oars,” and “mast” signify the various things of which doctrine consists; also that those who teach, lead, and rule, are meant by “pilot,” “shipmasters,” “rowers,” and “mariners,” and the doctrinals themselves by its “wares,” and the acquisition of spiritual wealth and spiritual riches, which are the knowledges of truth and good, through which wisdom is gained, by “trading.” It is therefore said, “thy wise men, O Tyre, were in thee, they were thy shipmasters.” [3] Again in the following chapter, which also treats of Tyre: Behold, thou art wiser than Daniel; there is no secret that they can hide from thee; in thy wisdom and in thine understanding thou hast made to thyself wealth, and hast made gold and silver in thy treasures; by the abundance of thy wisdom in thy trading thou hast increased to thyself wealth (Ezek. 28:3–5). From these passages it is clear that “Tyre” and her “tradings” mean the knowledges of truth and good through which wisdom is gained; what other reason could there be for saying so much about her wares and her merchandise if spiritual things were not meant?

And all that hold the oar shall come down from their ship, all the ship masters of the sea, and shall cry out bitterly over thee (27:18–30). “Ship masters” signify those who are wise by means of knowledges from the Word; “those that hold the oar” signify those who are intelligent; the vastation of wisdom and intelligence is signified by “the voice of the cry of the ship masters,” and by “those who hold the oar shall come down from the ships.” 514b. [5] That “ships” in the Word mean the knowledges of truth and good and also doctrinals from the Word, when the cargo is meant by the “ship,” that is, the contents for the containant, is further evident from these passages. In Isaiah: Howl, ye ships of Tarshish, for Tyre is devastated. The inhabitants of the island are still, the merchant of Zidon passing over the sea, they have filled thee. Howl, ye ships of Tarshish, for your stronghold is devastated (23:1, 2, 14). “The ships of Tarshish” mean doctrinals from the Word, for those ships carried gold and silver, which signify goods and truths and the knowledges of these from the Word; and as “Tyre” signifies the church in respect to the knowledges of truth and good, here the church vastated, therefore it is said, “Howl, ye ships of Tarshish, for Tyre is devastated”; “the inhabitants of the island” mean those who are in the goods of life according to their doctrinals; “the merchants of Zidon” signify those who are in truths from the Word, of whom it is said, “they have filled thee”; “your stronghold” signifies doctrine from the Word defending; and “it is devastated” signifies that there is no perception of it and thence no truth; for the same doctrinals from the Word apart from spiritual perception are not truths, for they are falsified by incorrect ideas respecting them.

For the ships of Tarshish in the beginning brought gold and silver in great abundance, which signified the goods of life and the truths of doctrine. [7] Of the ships of Tarshish it is said in the first book of Kings: Solomon made a ship in Ezion-geber, which is beside Eloth, on the shore of the Sea Suph, in the land of Edom. And Hiram sent his servants, shipmen that had knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon. They came to Ophir and took gold, four hundred and twenty talents, and brought it to King Solomon (9:26–28). The king had at sea a ship of Tarshish with the ship of Hiram; once in three years came the ship of Tarshish, bringing gold and silver, ivory and apes and peacocks (10:22). King Jehoshaphat built ships of Tarshish to go to Ophir for gold; but they went not, for the ships were broken at Ezion-geber (22:48). Although these are historical facts they contain a spiritual sense as well as the prophecies; “the ships made in Ezion-geber, at the shore of the Sea Suph in the land of Edom,” signified the knowledges of the natural man, for these contain in themselves, and as it were carry, spiritual wealth, as ships carry worldly wealth; for “the Sea Suph” and “the land of Edom,” where Ezion-geber was, were the outmost border of the land of Canaan, and the “outmost borders of the land of Canaan” signify the ultimates of the church, which are knowledges (scientiae), including the cognitions of truth and good. “Gold and silver” signify the goods and truths of the internal church; “ivory, apes, and peacocks,” signify the truths and goods of the external church; knowledges (scientia) here meaning such knowledges as the ancients had, namely, the knowledges of correspondences, of representations, and of influxes, and respecting heaven and hell, which especially included and were serviceable to the cognitions of truth and good of the church; “Hiram” signifies the nations that are out of the church with whom also there are cognitions of good and truth; and that the “ships” under king"

[8] From these considerations it can be seen what is signified in particular by “the ships of Tarshish” in the preceding passages, and also in David: By the east wind Thou breakest the ships of Tarshish (Ps. 48:7); “the east wind” signifying devastation and desolation; for the wind that comes from the east in the spiritual world overturns from their foundations the abodes of the evil, and they, with the treasures upon which they had set their hearts, are cast out into the hells (respecting this wind, see in the small work on the Last Judgment, n. 61). “The ships of Tarshish” here signify false doctrines. [9] Also in Isaiah: The day of Jehovah of Hosts upon all the cedars of Lebanon that are exalted and lifted up, and upon all the oaks of Bashan, and upon all the exalted mountains, and upon all the hills that are lifted up, and upon every lofty tower, and upon every fenced wall, and upon all the ships of Tarshish, and upon all images of desire, that the haughtiness of man [homo] may bow down, and the exaltation of men [viri] be brought low, and Jehovah alone be exalted in that day (2:12–17). “The day of Jehovah” means the Lord’s coming, when the Last Judgment was accomplished by Him. (That a Last Judgment was accomplished by the Lord when He was in the world may be seen in the small work on the Last Judgment, n. 46.) Those within the church upon whom the judgment was wrought are here recounted; “the cedars of Lebanon exalted and lifted up” signifying those who are boastful from self-intelligence, and “the oaks of Bashan” those who are boastful from knowledge (scientia), for “cedars” in the Word are predicated of the rational man, and “oaks” of the natural man, and intelligence belongs to the rational man, and knowledge to the natural man. “The exalted mountains and hills lifted up” signify those who are in the love of self and in the love of the world (see above, n. 405g); “lofty tower” and “fenced wall” signify confirmed principles of falsity, and thus also such as are in them;"

The destruction of the arrogance that springs from self-intelligence and knowledge is meant by “that the haughtiness of man (homo) may bow down, and the exaltation of men (viri) be brought low”; that all intelligence and knowledge are from the Lord is signified by “that Jehovah alone may be exalted in that day.” It is believed that knowledge is from man; but so far as knowledge is serviceable to intelligence, in which is the perception of truth, it is from the Lord alone. 514c. [10] In Isaiah: In Zion and in Jerusalem will the glorious Jehovah be unto us a place of rivers, of streams, of breadth of spaces; no ship of oar shall go therein, and no magnificent ship shall pass through it (33:21). “Zion and Jerusalem” mean the Lord’s church, “Zion” the church where the good of love rules, and “Jerusalem” the church where the truth of doctrine rules. Jehovah is called “glorious” (or magnificent) when men of the church are such as to be recipients of Divine good and truth from the Lord; and Zion and Jerusalem are called “a place of rivers, of streams, and of breadth of spaces,” when all their wisdom and intelligence, and good and truth, are from the Lord, “rivers” signifying wisdom, “streams” intelligence, and “breadth of spaces” truths from good in multitude and extension; “no ship of oar shall go therein, and no magnificent ship shall pass through it,” signifies that in the church there shall be no intelligence and wisdom from one’s own (proprium); “a ship of oar” meaning intelligence from one’s own, because it is moved by men by means of oars, and a “magnificent ship” wisdom from one’s own, because man is boastful and proud by reason of that wisdom; for when a ship is passing through and crossing the sea, thus bearing its cargo on its course, it signifies intelligence and wisdom. Here evidently no ship is meant, for this is said of Zion and Jerusalem.

Here the sea is not meant, nor creeping things, nor animals, nor leviathan (or a whale), nor ship, but such things as are with the men of the church, for these are what “wait upon Jehovah.” “The sea great and wide” signifies the external or natural man, which receives goods and truths as knowledge, “great” is predicated of the good therein, and “wide” of truth therein. “Creeping things” signify living knowledges; “animals great and small” the knowledges of good and truth of all kinds higher and lower, also in general and in particular (as in the preceding article, n. 513). “Ships” mean doctrinals, the “leviathan” (or whale) all things of the natural man in the complex; this is said “to play in the sea” because of the delight of knowing and thus of becoming wise. Since man by virtue of these things is actuated by a desire to know and understand, it is said, “All these wait upon Thee, that Thou mayest give them their food in its time,” “to wait upon” signifying to desire, and “food” knowledge and intelligence; for man does not desire these from himself, but from those things that are with him from the Lord; consequently these are what desire with man, although it appears as if man desired from himself. [12] In the same: They that go down to the sea in ships, that do work in many waters; these see the deeds of Jehovah and His wonders in the deep (107:23, 24). “They that go down to the sea in ships, that do work in many waters,” signify those who intensely study the doctrine of truth from the Word; “these see the deeds of Jehovah and His wonders in the deep,” signifies that they understand the truths and goods of heaven and the church, and the hidden things thereof, “the deeds of Jehovah” meaning all things of the Word that perfect man, all which have reference to truth and good, and “the wonders in the deep” meaning the hidden things of intelligence and wisdom.

This treats of the deliverance of the faithful from the oppression of those who lay waste the church; those who lay waste the church are meant by “Babylon,” and they lay it waste by withholding all from the knowledges of truth and good, affirming that they alone know and must be believed, and yet they know nothing of truth; thus they keep others with themselves in dense ignorance, and turn them away from the worship of the Lord, that they themselves may be worshiped. “To cast down their bars” signifies their principles of falsity and the falsities devastating truths, “bars” meaning the principles of falsity, and “the Chaldeans” those who devastate by falsities; for “Babylon” means those who destroy goods by means of evils, and the “Chaldeans” those who destroy truths by means of falsities. “In whose ships there is a cry” signifies the destruction of their doctrinals. [14] This destruction is further described by “ships” in Revelation: For in one hour so great riches was made desolate. And every ship master, and everyone concerned with the ships, and the sailors, and all who trade by sea, stood afar off, and cast dust upon their heads, and cried out weeping and mourning, saying, Woe, woe, the great city Babylon, wherein were made rich all that had ships in the sea, by reason of her preciousness; for in one hour has she been made desolate (18:17, 19). This passage will be explained further on. In Daniel: And at the time of the end shall the king of the south come into collision with him; and the king of the north shall rush upon him like a tempest, with chariot and with horsemen and with many ships; and he shall enter into the land and shall overflow and pass through (11:40). “The time of the end” signifies the last time of the church, when there is no truth because there is no good; “the king of the south” means truth in light, which is truth from good; “the king of the north” means no truth because there is no good, consequently falsity, for where there is no truth there is falsity, since man then"

[15] In Moses: And Jehovah shall bring thee back into Egypt in ships, by the way whereof I said unto thee, Thou shalt see it no more again; where ye shall be sold unto your enemies for menservants and for maidservants and there shall be no buyer (Deut. 28:68). This treats of the desolation of the church in respect to truth, when the life is not according to the Lord’s precepts in the Word; “the sons of Israel,” to whom this was said, represented and thence signified the church where the Word is, and truths of doctrine therefrom, thus spiritual men; but the “Egyptians” signified merely natural men. “Jehovah shall bring them back into Egypt in ships” signifies that they will be merely natural in consequence of doctrinals of falsity, “ships” meaning doctrinals of falsity; “by the way whereof I said unto thee, Thou shalt see it no more again,” signifies from being a spiritual man into being a merely natural man, for the man of the church from being a natural man becomes spiritual; but when he does not live according to the commandments from the Word, from being a spiritual man he becomes merely natural; “where ye shall be sold unto your enemies for menservants and maidservants,” signifies that falsities and evils shall become dominant; “and there shall be no buyer” signifies to become utterly vile."

(5:17). “Gilead” has a similar meaning with “Manasseh,” and “Manasseh” signifies the good of the natural man; and because the tribe of Manasseh did not fight in company with Deborah and Barak against the enemies, it is said, “Gilead, why dwellest thou in the passage of Jordan?” which signifies, why livest thou in externals only, which are of the natural man? The external of the church was signified by the regions beyond Jordan, and its internal by the regions on this side Jordan. The external of the church is with those who are more natural than spiritual. And because the tribe of Dan was not joined with Deborah and Barak in the battle with the enemies it is said, “why will Dan fear ships?” signifying, why does not one reject falsities and the doctrinals of falsity? [20] As all things in the Old Testament contain in themselves a spiritual sense, so do all things in the New Testament which are in the Gospels and in Revelation. Moreover, all the Lord’s words and doings and miracles signify Divine celestial things, because the Lord spoke from the Divine, and did His works and miracles from the Divine, therefore from things first through things last, and thus in fullness. From this it can be seen that the Lord’s teaching from boats was significative; also that it was significative that He chose certain of His disciples from boats while they were fishing; and that He walked upon the sea to the boat in which the disciples were, and thence calmed the wind. 514d. Respecting the Lord’s teaching from a boat it is said in the Gospels: Jesus sat by the seaside. And there were gathered unto Him great multitudes, so that He entered into a boat and sat; and the whole multitude stood on the beach. And He spake to them many things in parables (Matt. 13:1, 2, et seq.; Mark 4:1, 2, et seq.). Jesus, standing by the shore of Gennesaret, saw two boats standing by the lake. Then He entered into one of the boats, which was Simon’s, and asked him to put out a little from the land. And He sat down, and taught the throng out of the ship (Luke 5:1–9)."

This was done because the “sea” and the “lake of Gennesaret” signify, in reference to the Lord, the knowledges of good and truth in the whole complex, and “Simon’s boat” signifies the doctrinals of faith; so “His teaching from a boat” signifies that it was from doctrine. [21] Respecting the Lord’s walking on the sea to the boat in which the disciples were, it is said in the Gospels: The boat containing the Lord’s disciples was in the midst of the sea, tossed by the wind. In the fourth watch of the night, Jesus came unto them, walking on the sea. And Peter said, Bid me come unto Thee upon the water. And He said, Come. Therefore Peter, going down, walked upon the water to come to Jesus. But beginning to sink, he was afraid. Jesus stretching forth His hand, took hold of him, and said, O man of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt? And when they were come into the boat the wind ceased. And they that were in the boat worshiped Him, saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God (Matt. 14:24–33; Mark 6:48–52). When evening came His disciples went down unto the sea; and when they had entered into a boat they went over the sea toward Capernaum. And it was now dark, but Jesus was not come to them. And the sea was moved by a great wind that blew. When they had gone on about twenty-five or thirty stadia, they beheld Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh unto the boat; and they were afraid. But He said, It is I; be not afraid. Then they were willing to receive Jesus into the boat; and immediately the boat was at the land whither they were going (John 6:16–21, et seq.). Here, too, the particulars signify Divine spiritual things, which nevertheless do not appear in the letter; as the sea, the Lord’s walking upon it, the fourth watch in which He came to the disciples, and the ship, His entering into it, and from it restraining the wind and the waves of the sea, and other things besides. But there is no need singly to explain here the spiritual things signified; let it be said only that the “sea” signifies the ultimate of heaven and the church, since there are seas in the outmost borders of the heavens; the Lord’s walking upon the sea signifies the Lord’s presence and His influx even into these, and consequent life from the Divine to those who are in the ultimates of heaven; their life"

This was done “in the fourth watch” to signify the first state of the church, when it is daybreak and morning is at hand, for then good begins to act through truth, and then the Lord comes; that the sea in the meanwhile was moved by the wind, and that the Lord restrained it, signifies the natural state of life that precedes, which is an unpeaceful and as it were tempestuous state; but with the state that is nearest to morning, which is the first state of the church with man, because the Lord is then present in the good of love, there comes tranquillity of mind. [22] The like is signified by the Lord’s calming the wind and the waves of the sea, as described in the Gospels: When Jesus had entered into a boat His disciples followed Him. And behold, there arose a great commotion in the sea, so that the boat was covered by the waves; but He was asleep. Therefore the disciples, coming to Him awoke Him, saying, Lord, save us; we perish. Then He arose and rebuked the wind; and there was a great calm (Matt. 8:23–26; Mark 4:36–40; Luke 8:23, 24). This represented the state of men of the church when they are in what is natural and not yet in what is spiritual, in which state the natural affections, which are various cupidities springing from the loves of self and the world, rise up and produce various commotions of the mind. In this state the Lord appears as it were absent; this apparent absence is signified by His being asleep; but when they come out of a natural into a spiritual state these commotions cease, and there comes tranquillity of mind; for the Lord calms the tempestuous commotions of the natural man when the spiritual mind is opened, and through it the Lord flows into the natural. Since the affections that are of the love of self and of the world, and the consequent thoughts and reasonings, are from hell, for they are lusts of every kind that rise up therefrom into the natural man, these, too, are signified by “the wind and the waves of the sea,” and hell itself is signified by the “sea” in the spiritual sense."

From this it can be seen that “there fell from heaven a great star burning as a lamp” signifies the truth of the Word falsified by self-love. [2] It is to be noted that all those who are in the love of self, if they study the Word, falsify its truths, for the reason that all truth is out of heaven from the Lord, and nothing of it from what is man’s own (proprium), and those who are in the love of self are immersed in what is their own, and from that they obtain every idea of thought respecting the truths of the Word. In consequence of this they falsify these truths, not in respect to the sense of the letter of the Word, but in respect to the understanding of the truth that is in it; for to understand words otherwise than according to their true sense is to falsify them. [3] There are two states of man’s thoughts, one when from the Lord he is in thought respecting truths, the other when from himself. When from the Lord he is in thought respecting truths his mind is elevated even into the light of heaven, from which he has illustration and right perception of truth; but when from himself he is in thought respecting truths, his mind falls into the light of the world; and that light, in respect to things spiritual, or the things of heaven and the church, is thick darkness, in which man sees only such things as shine from the fire or the love of self and of the world, and these in themselves are falsities that are opposites of truths. 518a.

[2] When “to fall” is predicated of stars, which mean the knowledges of truth and good from the Word (as above), it signifies to perish, because when Divine truth in the spiritual world falls out of heaven to the earth there, where the evil are, it is turned into falsity, and when Divine truth becomes falsity it perishes. This is signified also by: The stars shall fall from heaven (Matt. 24:29; Mark 13:25); namely, that in the last time of the church the knowledges of truth and good will perish. That when Divine truth in the spiritual world falls out of heaven to the earth there, where the evil are, it is changed into falsity and thus perishes, may be seen above (n. 413a, 418a, 419a, f, 489); for Divine truth is changed into falsity of the same character as the evil belonging to those into whom it flows. This becomes evident from the following experience: it has been granted me to observe carefully how Divine truth was changed into falsity while it was passing down deep into hell, and it was perceived that it was changed successively as it flowed down, at length even into what was most false. [3] “Rivers” signify the understanding of truth, likewise intelligence, because “waters” signify truths, and the understanding is the receptacle and complex of truths, as a river is of waters, and because thought from the understanding, which is intelligence, is like a stream of truth. From the same origin, namely, from the signification of “waters” as being truths, a “fountain” signifies the Word and the doctrine of truth, and “pools,” “lakes,” and “seas,” signify the knowledges of truth in the complex. That “waters” signify truths, and “living waters” truths from the Lord, may be seen above (n. 71, 483); and also in the following passages in this article."

Thus in Isaiah: Then shall the lame leap as a hart, and the tongue of the dumb shall sing; for waters shall break out in the wilderness, and brooks in the plain of the desert (35:6). This is said of the Lord, also of the reformation of the Gentiles, and of the establishment of the church among them. “The lame who shall leap as a hart” signifies one who is not in genuine good because he is not in the knowledges of truth and good; “the tongue of the dumb which shall sing” signifies confession of the Lord by those who are in ignorance of the truth; “waters shall break out in the wilderness” signifies that there shall be truths where there were none before; “and brooks in the plain of the desert” signifies that there shall be intelligence where there was none before, “wilderness” meaning where there is no truth, and “plain of the desert” where there is no intelligence; “waters” mean truths, and “brooks” intelligence. [5] In the same: I will open rivers on the heights, and fountains will I place in the midst of the valleys, I will make the wilderness into a pool of waters, and the dry land into springs of waters (Isa. 41:18). This is said of the salvation of the Gentiles by the Lord; “to open rivers on the heights” means to bestow interior intelligence; and “to place fountains in the midst of valleys” means to instruct the external man in truths. (The rest may be seen explained in n. 483.) [6] In the same: Behold I am doing a new thing; now it shall spring forth; shall ye not know it? I will even place a way in the wilderness and rivers in the desert. The wild beast of the field shall honor Me, the dragons and the daughters of the owl; because I will give waters in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert, to give drink to My people, My chosen (Isa. 43:19, 20)."

[7] In the same: I will pour out waters upon him that is thirsty, and streams upon the dry ground; I will pour out My spirit upon thy seed, and My blessing upon thine offspring (Isa. 44:3). “To pour out waters upon him that is thirsty” signifies to instruct in truths those who are in the affection of truth; “to pour streams upon the dry land” signifies to give intelligence to those who are in a desire for truth from good; the like is signified by “pouring out the spirit and the blessing”; for God’s “spirit” signifies Divine truth, and “blessing” its multiplication and fructification, thus intelligence. Who does not see that here and above, waters and streams, wilderness and desert, are not meant, but such things as pertain to the church? Therefore it is here added, “I will pour out My spirit upon thy seed, and My blessing upon thine offspring.” [8] In Moses: For Jehovah leadeth thee to a land of brooks of water, of fountains, of depths flowing forth in valley and mountain (Deut. 8:7). The land of Canaan, to which Jehovah was to lead them, signifies the church, therefore “brooks of water, fountains, and depths flowing forth in valley and mountain,” signify such things as belong to the church; “brooks of water” signifying the understanding of truth, “fountains” doctrinals from the Word, and"

Here, too, “a place of rivers and streams” signifies wisdom and intelligence (the signification of the rest is explained above, n. 514c). [10] In Joel: In that day the mountains shall drop down must, and the hills shall flow with milk, and all the watercourses of Judah shall flow with waters, and a fountain shall go forth out of the house of Jehovah and shall water the brook of Shittim (3:18). (This also has been explained above, n. 433c, 483.) “The fountain that shall go forth out of the house of Jehovah” signifies the truth of doctrine out of heaven from the Lord; and “the brook of Shittim that it shall water,” signifies the illustration of the understanding. [11] In Ezekiel: The waters issued out from under the threshold of the house of God towards the east. The man led me and brought me back upon the bank of the river. When I returned, behold upon the bank of the river very many trees on the one side and on the other. He said, Every living soul that creepeth, whithersoever the rivers shall come, shall live; whence there are exceeding many fish, because these waters come thither and are healed, that everything may live whither the river cometh. And by the river upon the bank thereof, on this side and on that side, cometh up every tree for food, whose leaf falleth not, neither is the fruit thereof consumed; it is renewed in its months, because its waters flow out of the sanctuary (47:1–12).

[12] In Jeremiah: Blessed is the man that trusteth in Jehovah; He shall be like a tree planted by the waters and that sendeth forth his roots by the stream, and he shall not see when the heat shall come, his leaf shall be green (17:7, 8). “The tree planted by the waters” means a man with whom there are truths from the Lord; “he sendeth forth his roots by the stream” means the extension of intelligence from the spiritual man into the natural. (The rest may be seen explained above, n. 481.) 518b. Where trees and gardens are treated of in the Word, waters and rivers to water them are also mentioned, for the reason that “trees” signify perceptions and knowledges, and “waters” and “rivers” truths and understanding therefrom; for without the understanding of truths man is like a garden where there is no water, whose trees wither away. [13] As in Moses: As the valleys are they planted, as gardens by the river, as lign aloes which Jehovah hath planted, and as cedar trees beside the waters (Num. 24:6). This is said of the sons of Israel, by whom the church is signified which was then to be planted. This church is compared to valleys which are planted, and to a garden by the river, because “valleys” signify the intelligence of the natural man, and a “garden” the intelligence of the spiritual man, and it is compared to lign aloes and cedar trees, because “lign aloes” signify the things of the"

[14] As “the garden in Eden” or “paradise” means the wisdom and intelligence that the most ancient people had who lived before the flood, so where their wisdom is described, the influx of Divine truth, and of intelligence thence, is also described in these words: A river went forth from Eden to water the garden, and from thence it was parted and was in four heads (Gen. 2:10, et seq.). “A river from Eden” signifies wisdom from love, which is Eden; “to water the garden” means to bestow intelligence; intelligence is described by the four rivers there treated of. (This may be seen explained in Arcana Coelestia, n. 107–121.) [15] In Ezekiel: Asshur, a cedar in Lebanon. The waters made it grow, the abyss made it high, so that with its rivers it went round about its plant, and sent out its conduits unto all the trees of the field (31:3, 4). “Asshur” signifies the rational man, or the rational of man, likewise “the cedar in Lebanon”; and because the genuine rational is perfected by the knowledges of truth and good it is said that “the waters made it grow, and the abyss made it high,” “waters” meaning truths, and “the abyss” the knowledges of truth in the natural man; the increase of intelligence is signified by “with its rivers it went round about its plant”; and the multiplication of the knowledges of truth by “it sent out its conduits unto all the trees of the field.” [16] In David: Thou hast caused a vine to go forth out of Egypt.

The extension of the church and the multiplication of its truths and of intelligence therefrom are described by the extension of the land of Canaan to the Sea Suph, to the sea of the Philistines, and to the river Euphrates. [17] In Moses: And I will set thy border from the Sea Suph even to the sea of the Philistines, and from the wilderness even to the river (Exod. 23:31). “The borders of the land of Canaan” signify the ultimates of the church, which are true knowledges (scientifica vera), cognitions of truth and good from the Word, and things rational. “The Sea Suph” signifies true knowledge; “the sea of the Philistines,” where Tyre and Sidon were, signifies the knowledges of truth and good from the sense of the letter of the Word; and “the river Euphrates” signifies the rational; for knowledges serve the cognitions of truth and good from the Word, and both these serve the rational, and the rational serves intelligence, which is given by means of spiritual truths joined to spiritual good. 518c.

The ultimates of heaven are seas and rivers, as has been several times said above. These were represented by the two seas and by the two rivers that formed the boundaries of the land of Canaan. The two seas were the sea of Egypt and the sea of the Philistines, where were Tyre and Sidon; and the two rivers were the Euphrates and the Jordan. But the Jordan was the boundary between the interior land of Canaan and the exterior; in the exterior were the tribes of Reuben and Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh. Likewise in Zechariah: His dominion shall be from sea even to sea, and from the river even to the ends of the earth (9:10). This, too, is said of the Lord, and has a like meaning; His dominion even to the ultimates of heaven and the church means over all things of heaven and the church, for the ultimates are the boundaries.

Let the rivers clap their hands; let the mountains sing aloud together (Ps. 98:7, 8). The glorification of the Lord by the universal heaven is signified by these words. The glorification from its ultimates is signified by “Let the sea and the fullness thereof give forth a sound”; the glorification from the whole heaven is signified by “let the world and they that dwell therein give forth a sound,” “the world” signifying the universal heaven in respect to its truths, and “they that dwell therein” signifying the universal heaven in respect to its goods; for “inhabitants” signify in the Word those who are in the goods of heaven and the church, and thus the goods of such. The glorification of the Lord by the truths of intelligence and by the goods of love, is signified by “let the rivers clap their hands, let the mountains sing aloud together,” “rivers” meaning the truths of intelligence, and “mountains” the goods of love. 518d. [21] Divine truth from the Lord, the reception of which is the source of intelligence, is signified by “the waters from the rock in Horeb” (Exod. 17:6), thus spoken of in David: He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and made them to drink out of the great abysses, and He brought flowing waters out of the rock, and made the waters to run down like rivers. He smote the rock, so that the waters gushed out and the brooks overflowed (Ps. 78:15, 16, 20). He opened the rock that the waters might flow; the rivers ran in the dry places (Ps. 105:41). The “rock” here means the Lord; and the “waters that flowed out therefrom” mean Divine truth from Him; and the “rivers” signify intelligence and wisdom therefrom; “to drink of the great abysses” signifies to imbibe and perceive the arcana of wisdom."

[36] In Isaiah: Behold, the Lord will make to go up upon them the waters of the river, strong and many, the king of Assyria and all his glory; and he shall go up over all his channels, and shall go over all his banks; and he shall go through Judah, and shall overflow (8:7, 8). “Assyria” and its king signify in the Word the rational, here the rational perverted; so “his river” which was the Euphrates, means reasoning, and “the waters of the river” mean falsities confirmed by reasonings; these therefore are signified by “the waters of the river, strong and many,” which are called “strong” from cupidity, and “many” from falsity; the abundance of falsities from evil destroying the truths of the good of the church is signified by “the waters of the river shall go up over all his channels, and over all his banks,” also “he shall go through Judah, and shall overflow,” “Judah” signifying the church where the Word is. [37] In Jeremiah: What hast thou to do with the way of Egypt, to drink the waters of Sihor? Or what hast thou to do with the way of Assyria, to drink the waters of the river? (2:18)."

[38] In the same: Towards the north, by the bank of the river Euphrates, have they stumbled and fallen. Who is this that cometh up like a stream, whose waters are tossed like the streams? Egypt cometh up like a stream, and his waters are tossed like streams; for he saith, I will come up, I will cover the earth, I will destroy the city and those that dwell in it (Jer. 46:6–8). This signifies the destruction of the church and of its truths by false reasonings from confirming knowledges; the “north” signifies those in whom and from whom there is falsity, the “river Euphrates” false reasonings, “Egypt” confirming knowledges, the “waters that are tossed” falsities themselves, and “to come up, to cover the earth, to destroy the city and those that dwell in it,” signifies the destruction of the church and of its doctrine, the “earth” meaning the church, the “city” doctrine of truth, and “those that dwell in it” its goods. Like things are signified by the Nile, “the river of Egypt,” and by the Euphrates, “the river of Assyria,” elsewhere in the Word (as in Isa. 7:18, 19; 11:15, 16; Ezek. 29:3–5, 10; 31:15; 32:2; Ps. 74:14, 15; 78:44; Exod. 7:17–21); also by “the rivers of Babylon” (Ps. 137:1). As all spiritual temptations come through falsities that break into the thoughts and infest the interior mind, thus through reasonings from falsities, so temptations are signified by the inundations of waters and by the irruptions of rivers and torrents. As in Jonah: Thou hadst cast me into the depths, even into the heart of the seas; and the river was round about me; all Thy waves and Thy billows passed over me (2:3). In David: The cords of death compassed me, and the brooks of Belial terrified me (Ps. 18:4)."

In Luke: When a flood arose, the stream dashed against that house and could not shake it; for it had been founded upon a rock (6:48, 49). 519a. Verse 11. And the name of the star is called Wormwood, signifies truth mixed with the falsity of evil. This is evident from the signification of “name,” as meaning what the state is, and what the thing is (see above, n. 148); from the signification of “star,” here “a great star burning as a lamp,” as being the truth of the Word falsified by self-love; and from the signification of “wormwood,” as being truth mixed with the falsity of evil. This is signified by “wormwood” because of its bitterness, and bitterness springs from what is sweet mixed with the opposite unsweet; therefore “bitterness” like that of wormwood and gall means in the spiritual sense truth mixed with the falsity that is the opposite of truth, which is the falsity of evil; for savor and taste signify the affection of knowing and of becoming wise, therefore what is savory signifies the delightfulness and pleasantness of wisdom; and “delicacies,” because they are savory, signify the truths of wisdom. (That this is from correspondence see Arcana Coelestia, n. 3502, 3536, 3589, 4791–4805.) That “wormwood” and “gall” from their bitterness, signify truth mixed with the falsity of evil is evident also from what follows in this verse; for it is said that “many men died of the waters because they were made bitter,” which signifies that through truths falsified all such perished in respect to spiritual life; for truths are what make the spiritual life, while falsities of evil extinguish it; and when truths are mixed with falsities of evil they are no longer true but falsified; and truths falsified are in themselves falsities.

When He had been crucified, one of them running and taking a sponge and filling it with vinegar, and putting it on a reed gave Him to drink (Matt. 27:33, 34, 48; Mark 15:23, 36). After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now finished, that the Scripture might be fulfilled said, I thirst. And there had been placed a vessel full of vinegar; and they filled a sponge and placed it upon hyssop and put it to His mouth. And when He had received the vinegar He said, It is finished (John 19:28–30). Each and every thing that is related in the Gospels respecting the Lord’s passion signifies in the spiritual sense, the state of the church at that time in relation to the Lord and the Word; for the Lord was the Word because He was Divine truth; and as the Jews had treated the Word, or Divine truth, so they treated the Lord (respecting which see above, n. 64, 195). Their giving to the Lord “vinegar mingled with gall,” which was also called “wine mingled with myrrh,” signified the quality of the Divine truth from the Word with the Jewish nation, namely, that it was mingled with the falsity of evil, and thus altogether falsified and adulterated, therefore He would not drink it. But that afterwards “they gave the Lord vinegar in a sponge and placed it upon hyssop” signified the kind of falsity there was among the upright Gentiles, which was falsity from ignorance of the truth, in which there was something good and useful; because this falsity is accepted by the Lord He drank this vinegar; the “hyssop” upon which they placed it signifies the purification of the falsity; that the Lord said “I thirst,” signifies Divine spiritual thirst, which is for Divine truth and good in the church, by which the human race is saved. (Respecting the falsity of evil, what it was with the Jewish nation, and the falsity of ignorance in which there is good, what this was with the upright Gentiles, see the New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine, n. 21.)

Here “gall,” “vinegar,” and “thirst,” have a similar signification as above, since this is said of the Lord; the “table that shall be to them for a snare,” signifies going astray in respect to every truth of doctrine from the Word, for “table” has reference to all spiritual food, and spiritual food is everything of doctrine from the Word; the “eyes that will be darkened that they see not,” signify the understanding of truth; the “loins that will be made to falter,” signify the will of good, and its marriage with the understanding of truth; “loins” have the same signification in other parts of the Word. [4] In Lamentations: He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath made me drunken with wormwood. Therefore I said, My victory hath perished, and my hope from Jehovah. Remember my misery and my lament, the wormwood and the hemlock (3:15, 18, 19). This, too, is said of the Lord. That the Lord found nothing but falsities and falsified truths in the church that then existed among the Jews is signified by “He hath filled me with bitterness, and hath made me drunken with wormwood,” “wormwood” meaning the falsity of evil mixed with truths, thus what is falsified; the Lord’s combat with the hells, and His hopelessness of ever bringing back the Jewish nation to a reception and acknowledgment of truths is signified by “My victory hath perished, and my hope from Jehovah; remember my misery and my lament, the wormwood and the hemlock”; for the spirits who are in the falsities of evil and yet in truths from the sense of the letter of the Word make longer resistance before they are subjugated and cast down into hell, and for the reason that through truths they have communication with heaven, and this communication and consequent conjunction must be broken and removed before they are cast down; this involves despair as to victory, such as the Lord experienced upon the cross when He said “I thirst,” and they gave Him vinegar."

Behold, I will feed them, this people, with wormwood, and make them to drink waters of gall; and I will scatter them among the nations; and I will send the sword after them until I shall have consumed them (9:15, 16). Behold, I will feed them with wormwood, and make them drink waters of gall; for from the prophets of Jerusalem hypocrisy hath gone forth into all the land (23:15). This, too, is said of the Jewish nation, which in a thousand ways perverted the Word, falsified its truth, and adulterated its good; “wormwood” signifies the evil of falsity, and “waters of gall” the falsity of evil, both mixed with the truths and goods of the Word. That from themselves and from their heart they were in evils and falsities from evils is signified by “Jehovah will feed them with wormwood, and make them to drink waters of gall”; for evil and falsity are attributed to Jehovah, that is, to the Lord, as in many passages elsewhere, and yet they are of man himself; the reasons for this have often been given above. “The hypocrisy that went forth from the prophets of Jerusalem” signifies such mingling of falsity and truth, for they spoke truths while they taught falsities; they spoke truths when they spoke from the Word, and they taught falsities when they taught from themselves and their doctrine; their destruction by the evils of falsity and by the falsities of evil is signified by “I will scatter them among the nations, and I will send the sword after them”; “to scatter among the nations” signifying to destroy by the evils of falsity, and “to send the sword after them” signifying to destroy by the falsities of evil.

They turn judgment into wormwood, and thrust down righteousness to the earth (5:7). “Jehovah will smite the great house with gaps, and the little house with clefts,” signifies much perversion and falsification of truth with the learned, and some with the unlearned, a “great house” signifying a learned man, and a “little house” an unlearned man; “gaps” signify truths destroyed by falsities, and “clefts” the same, but in a less degree; that the understanding of truth and the will of good are not possible where there is the falsity of evil, is signified by “Shall horses run upon the rock? Shall one plow with oxen?”; “horses running” meaning the understanding of truth, and “plowing with oxen” the will of good. That this is because truths were falsified and the goods of the Word were adulterated is signified by, “For ye have turned judgment into gall, and the fruit of righteousness into wormwood,” “judgment” signifying the truth of the Word, and “the fruit of righteousness” its good. 519b. [7] That the quality of the sons of Jacob, who were called Israelites and Jews, was such, is plainly declared by Moses in his song, in which they are described in these words: Their vine is of the vine of Sodom and of the fields of Gomorrah; their grapes are grapes of gall, they have clusters of bitterness. Their wine is the poison of dragons, and the cruel gall of asps (Deut. 32:32, 33). “Vine” signifies the church, and this is said to be “of the vine of Sodom and of the fields of Gomorrah” because “Sodom” signifies all evils springing from the love of self, and “Gomorrah” all the falsities of those evils; “grapes” signify the goods of the church, and “clusters” the truths of the church. That instead of the goods of the church they had the worst evils and falsities mingled with truths is signified by “their grapes are grapes of gall, they have clusters of bitterness”; “wine” signifies the truth and good of faith; that this with them was external, in which was evil from the interior, is signified by “their wine is the poison of dragons, and the cruel gall of asps.” (That the sons of Jacob were such, although there was a"

[8] That “gall” and “wormwood” signify evil and falsity mingled with good and truth, is further evident from these words in Moses: Lest there be among you man or woman, or family or tribe, whose heart looketh back this day from with Jehovah our God, to go to serve the gods of the nations; lest there be among you a root bearing gall and wormwood (Deut. 29:18). Here, too, “gall” and “wormwood” signify the mingling of good and truth with evil and falsity, which is done when other gods are worshiped with the heart, and Jehovah only with the lips; then the external sounds like good and appears like truth, but the internal is evil and falsity; and when the interiors are evils and falsities, and the exteriors are goods and truths, there is a mingling of the two, and then the good becomes gall, and the truth becomes wormwood. It is similar when man in his heart hates the neighbor and denies the truths of the church, and yet outwardly avows charity towards the neighbor and professes the truths of the church; there is then in him “a root bearing gall and wormwood,” for he lets in evils and falsities from the interior, and mixes them with the goods and truths that he displays in the externals. [9] In Job: Though evil shall have been sweet in his mouth, though he shall have hidden it under his tongue; though he shall have spared it and not forsaken it but shall keep it within his mouth, his bread in his bowels shall be changed, it shall be the gall of asps in the midst of him; he hath swallowed riches and he shall vomit them up again, God shall cast them out of his belly. He shall suck the poison of asps, the viper’s tongue shall slay him (20:12–16). Thus is described the hypocrisy from which man speaks things holy and stimulates good affections, while inwardly he denies and blasphemes. What is within is described by “he hides evil under his tongue, and keeps it within his mouth.” That consequently good is infected with evil and is cast out, is signified by “his bread in his bowels shall be changed, it shall be the gall of asps in the midst”;"

That truth also is cast out by falsity is signified by “he hath swallowed riches and he shall vomit them up again, God shall cast them out of his belly”; this falsity is meant by “the poison of asps.” [10] It is to be known that good and evil, and the truth of good and the falsity of evil, are mingled when evil and falsity are in man’s spirit while good and truth are in the deeds and speech of his body. But what is in the spirit of man, that is, what is interior, acts into that which belongs to the body or what is exterior; for it flows in and causes the exterior, which appears to be good and true, nevertheless to be bitter like gall and wormwood, although before men it seems to be sweet. And because the good and truth of their mouth and speech are such, therefore when man after death becomes a spirit the good is separated from the evil and the falsity from the truth, and good and truth are taken away, and thus the spirit becomes his own evil and falsity. But it must be known that this mingling of good and evil and of truth and falsity is not the profanation of good and truth; profanation occurs only with those who have first received truth and good in heart and faith, and afterwards in heart and faith deny them. 520. And the third part [of the waters] became wormwood, signifies that every truth in the understanding and in doctrine became such. This is evident from the signification of “the third part,” as being all, here every truth in the understanding and in doctrine, because it is predicated of “the rivers” and “the fountains of waters,” which signify the understanding of truth, and doctrine from the Word (that “the third part” signifies all, see above, n. 506); also from the signification of “wormwood,” as being truth mixed with the falsity of evil (as was explained in the preceding article). This makes evident that “the third part became wormwood” signifies that every truth in the understanding and in doctrine was mixed with the falsity of evil. Truth is mixed with the falsity of evil when evils of life, which are adulteries, whoredoms, murders, hatreds of various kinds, enmities, injustices for the sake of gain, artful and clandestine thefts and robberies, cunning, deceit, and other like evils are confirmed by the sense of the letter of the Word, so, too,"

The truths of the sense of the letter of the Word, that they may remain truths, must be applied to the confirmation of goods of life and true principles of religion; if they are drawn aside and diverted from this application as their end they are no longer truths, since there is no perception of truth in them. The perception of truth comes from good, not from evil. [2] For in every part of the Word there is a marriage of good and truth; consequently if good is not in the truths of the Word, as they are perceived, truths are without their consort, and may be applied to any evil cupidities and to any false principles whatsoever, and thus become the falsities of evil. In this way the truths of the Word are falsified by all those who from self-love are in the pride of self- intelligence; for inwardly, evils of every kind from love of self, and thence falsities of every kind from the pride of self-intelligence, have rule, while outwardly, in speech and in preaching, there are truths from the Word which sound like truths to those who are in simple good, but within with the one speaking or preaching these swarm with falsities of every kind.

(That the Lord appears as a sun and as a moon in the angelic heavens may be seen in the work Heaven and Hell, n. 116–125.)

In Joel: The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and terrible day of Jehovah cometh (2:31). “The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood,” has a similar signification as “the third part of the sun and the third part of the moon were darkened,” namely, that at the end of the church there will be the falsity of evil in the place of the good of love, and evil of falsity in the place of truth of faith. [4] Elsewhere in the Word where the darkening of the sun and moon is spoken of there is a like meaning, as in Isaiah: For the stars of the heavens and the constellations thereof shall not make their light to shine; the sun shall be darkened in its rising, and the moon shall not make bright her light (13:10; 24:21, 23).

In Joel: The day of Jehovah is near in the valley of decision; the sun and the moon have been darkened, and the stars have withdrawn their brightness (3:14, 15). The day of Jehovah cometh, a day of darkness and of thick darkness, a day of cloud and obscurity. Before Him the earth trembled, the sun and the moon were darkened, and the stars withdrew their brightness (2:1-2, 10). In the Gospels: Immediately after the affliction of those days the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven (Matt. 24:29; Mark 13:24, 25). This is said of the last time of the church, when there is no longer any spiritual good or truth, or the good and truth of heaven and the church, but evil and falsity. That the goods and truths of the church, which are called the goods of love and the truths of faith are changed into evils and falsities, is signified by “the sun and moon shall be obscured and darkened, and the stars shall not give their light”; the Last Judgment that then follows is meant by “the day of Jehovah great and terrible”; and as this comes when the church is in darkness and in thick darkness, that day is also called “a day of darkness and thick darkness,” and also “a day of cloud and obscurity,” as also in the following passages. [5] In Amos: Woe unto you that desire the day of Jehovah. What to you is the day of Jehovah? It is darkness, and not light. Shall not the day of Jehovah be darkness, and not light? Even thick darkness, and no brightness to it? (5:18, 20). In Zephaniah:"

He shall look unto the earth, and behold distress and darkness dimmed with straitness and driven with thick darkness (8:22). Behold, darkness covereth the earth, and thick darkness the peoples (60:2). In Jeremiah: Give glory to Jehovah your God before He causeth darkness, and before your feet stumble upon the mountains of twilight; then shall ye look for light, but He will turn it into the shadow of death, He will make it thick darkness (13:16). This is said of the last time of the church, when the Lord is to come into the world, and judgment is to be accomplished; because there will then be no longer any good of love or truth of faith, but the evil of falsity and the falsity of evil, that day is called “a day of darkness and of thick darkness.” [6] The same is signified by: The darkness that came over all the land from the sixth hour to the ninth hour when the Lord was crucified (Matt. 27:45; Mark 15:33; Luke 23:44–49). “The darkness over all the land” represented that in the whole church there was nothing but evil and falsity therefrom, and falsity and evil therefrom; moreover, the three hours signify what is full and complete; for each and all things related in the Gospels respecting the Lord’s passion have stored up in them arcana of heaven, and signify Divine celestial things, which can be laid open only by means of the internal spiritual sense."

In Isaiah: Woe unto them that call evil good and good evil, that put darkness for light and light for darkness (5:20). “To put darkness for light and light for darkness” signifies to call falsity truth and truth falsity; it is clear that “darkness” means falsity and “light” truth, for good and evil are first spoken of, therefore what follows must be respecting truth and falsity. [8] In John: This is the judgment, that the Light hath come into the world, and men have loved the darkness rather than the light, because their works were evil (3:19). The Lord here calls Himself the Light because He was the Divine truth itself when in the world; therefore “the Light” signifies the Lord in relation to Divine truth, also Divine truth from the Lord; and as darkness is opposed to light, “the darkness that men loved rather than the light” signifies infernal falsity, which is the falsity of evil. That the falsity of evil is here signified by “darkness” is evident from its being said, “because their works were evil.” The falsity of evil springs from evil works, or the evils of life; for as good joins to itself truth, so evil joins to itself falsity; for the one belongs to the other. [9] “Light” and “darkness” have a similar signification in the following passages in John: In Him was life, and the life was the Light of men. And the light appeareth in the darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not (1:4, 5). Jesus said, I am the Light of the world; he that followeth Me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life (8:12). Jesus said, Walk while ye have the Light, that darkness overtake you not; for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth."

In these passages “darkness” signifies infernal falsity; for the “light” to which darkness is opposed, signifies Divine truth. “Light” signifies Divine truth because light in the heavens is in its essence Divine truth proceeding from the Lord (see in the work Heaven and Hell, n. 116–140). Now as Divine truth is the light in the heavens, it follows that the falsity of evil, which is the falsity in the hells, is darkness. This darkness is not indeed darkness to those who are in the hells, for they see one another; but the light by which they see is like the lumen from burning coal, and this lumen, when the light of heaven flows into it, becomes mere darkness. For this reason also the caverns and dens in which they are appear to those in heaven like gloomy caves. [10] From this it can be seen why “darkness” signifies the falsities of evil, and why the Lord says: That those who are in hell are to be cast into outer darkness (Matt. 8:12; 22:13; 25:30). In David: The enemy pursueth my soul; he hath crushed my life down to the earth; he hath made me to sit in darkness, like the dead of the world (Ps. 143:3). “The enemy who pursueth his soul” signifies in the spiritual sense evil; consequently “to make me to sit in darkness” signifies falsities. [11] In Isaiah: Judgment is far from us, and righteousness doth not overtake us; we wait for light, but behold darkness; for brightness, but we walk in thick darkness (59:9). “Judgment is far from us” signifies that there is no understanding of truth; “righteousness doth not overtake us” signifies that there is no good of life; “we wait for light, but behold darkness,” signifies waiting for truth, but behold falsity; “for brightness, but we walk in"

[12] In Luke: But this is your hour and the power of darkness (22:53). The Lord said this to the chief priests, the captains of the temple, and the elders, who seized Him by the aid of Judas. The power to do this wickedness the Lord calls “the power of darkness,” because they were in the falsities of evil, in falsities respecting the Lord and in evils against Him; here also “darkness” means hell, because such falsities of evil are there. [13] In the same: The lamp of the body is the eye; when therefore thine eye is pure thy whole body also shall be light; but when the eye is evil thy body also shall be dark. Take heed, therefore, that the light that is in thee be not darkness. If thy whole body therefore be light, having no part dark, the whole shall be light, as when a lamp by its flashing doth give thee light (Luke 11:34–36; Matt. 6:22, 23). The “eye” here signifies the understanding, and the “pure (or single) eye” the understanding of truth from good; but the “evil eye” signifies the understanding of falsity from evil; the “body” that is either light or dark, means the whole man. From this the signification of these words in series can be concluded, namely, that the whole man is such as is his understanding from the will; for every man is his truth and his good, because he is his love or affection; therefore he is throughout wholly such as he is in respect to his understanding from his will; for all truth is of the understanding, and all good is of the will; for the body is a mere obedience, since it is the effect of an effecting cause, and the effecting cause is the understanding from the will; therefore such as is the quality of the one such is that of the other, for the effect has its all from its effecting cause.

Likewise the “darkness” in Genesis (15:17), and in many other passages. [15] It has been shown thus far that “darkness” signifies in the Word the falsities of evil. “Darkness” signifies also falsities not of evil, such as were the falsities of religion among the upright Gentiles, which falsities were with them because of their ignorance of the truth; that these falsities were also called “darkness” is evident from the following passages: This people walking in darkness have seen a great light; those dwelling in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light become bright (Isa. 9:2). In Matthew: A people sitting in darkness saw a great light; and to those sitting in the region and shadow of death a light hath arisen (4:16)."

In these passages “darkness” signifies the falsities of ignorance, such as existed, and as exist at this day among the upright Gentiles. These falsities are altogether distinct from the falsities of evil, which have evil stored up in them because they are from evil, while the former have good stored up in them because they have good as an end. Those, therefore, who are in these falsities can be instructed in truths, and they also when instructed receive truths in the heart, for the reason that good, which is in their falsities, loves truth, and also conjoins itself to truth when it is heard. It is otherwise with the falsities of evil; these are averse to all truth and cast it off because it is truth, and thus is not in agreement with evil.

And as the sense of the letter of the Word is natural, that sense also is called in the Word “a cloud,” and also “darkness,” in comparison with the internal spiritual sense, which is the light of heaven, and is called “glory.” 527. That the day should not shine for the third part of it, and the night likewise, signifies that the spiritual light of truth and the natural light of truth were completely extinguished. This is evident from the signification of “day,” as being spiritual light, and from the signification of “night,” as being natural light. This is the signification, since it was said above that “the third part of the sun, the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars, were darkened”; and “day” means the light of the sun, and “night” the light of the moon and stars, since the sun gives light during the day, and the moon and the stars give light at night. In the first place, let something be said respecting light from the sun, which is called the light of the day, and respecting light from the moon and the stars, which is called “the light of the night.” [2] By light from the sun, which is called “the light of the day” and by “day,” spiritual light is meant, such as the angels have who see the Lord as a sun; and by light from the moon and stars, which is called “the light of the night” and by “night,” natural light is meant, such as the angels have who behold the Lord as a moon. (That the Lord appears to the angels both as a sun and as a moon, see in the work Heaven and Hell, 116–125.) Those heavens behold the Lord as a sun that are in the spiritual affection of truth, that is, that love truth because it is truth. Because this is spiritual, therefore the light that is from the Lord as a sun is spiritual. But those heavens behold the Lord as a moon that are in the natural affection of truth, that is, that love truth that they may be learned and may instruct others. These love truth because of its usefulness to themselves, and not for the truth’s own sake; therefore they are in a light that proceeds from the Lord as a moon. This light differs from the light that goes forth from the Lord as a sun, as the light of day from the sun differs from the light of night from the moon and"

[3] Those, therefore, who are in spiritual light are in genuine truths, and also when they hear truths that they had not before known, they immediately acknowledge them and see that they are truths. It is otherwise with those who are in natural light. When such hear truths they receive them, not because they see or perceive them, but because they are told them by men of reputation in whom they have confidence; the faith, therefore, of most of such is from others, and yet they are in a life according to faith. Into these heavens all come who have lived well, although they have been in falsities of doctrine; nevertheless the falsities are there continually purified, until at length they appear as truths. This makes evident what is signified by “that the day should not shine for the third part of it, and the night likewise.” (That “the third part” signifies all, fullness, and wholly, see above, n. 506.)

And God saw the light that it was good; and God divided between the light and the darkness. And God called the light day, and the darkness He called night. And there was evening and there was morning, the first day (1:3–5). And afterwards: And God said, Let there be luminaries in the expanse of the heavens, to divide between the day and the night; and let them be for signs and for seasons, and for days and years. And God made two great luminaries; the great luminary to rule by day, and the lesser luminary to rule by night, and the stars. And God set them in the expanse of the heavens to give light upon the earth, and to rule by day and by night, and to divide between the light and the darkness. And there was evening and there was morning, the fourth day (1:14–19)."

That “God saw the light that it was good” signifies that illustration and reception with them were good. But “darkness” signifies the lumen that is in the natural man, which is called natural lumen, because this lumen in comparison with spiritual light is like darkness, consequently this is meant by “darkness.” For every man has a lower or exterior mind, and a higher or interior mind; the lower or exterior mind is the natural mind, which is called the natural man, while the higher or interior mind is the spiritual mind, and is called the spiritual man. The mind is called a man, for the reason that man is man because of his mind. These two minds, the higher and the lower, are altogether distinct; by the lower mind man is in the natural world, together with the men there, but by the higher mind he is in the spiritual world with the angels there. These two minds are so distinct that while man is living in the world he does not know what is going on in himself in his higher mind; and when he becomes a spirit, as he does immediately after death, he does not know what is going on in his lower mind; therefore it is said “God divided between the light and the darkness, and He called the light day, and the darkness night.” This makes evident that “day” signifies spiritual light, and “darkness” natural light. Because all the heavens are so divided that those who are in spiritual light are in light from the Lord as a sun, and those who are in spiritual-natural light are in light from the Lord as a moon (as was just said in this article), it is said, “Let there be two luminaries in the expanse of the heavens to divide between the day and the night, and to rule by day and by night, and to divide between the light and the darkness.” From this, therefore, it is evident that “day” here means spiritual light, and “night” natural light, which in heaven is called spiritual-natural light."

In Jeremiah: Jehovah giveth the sun for the light of the day, and the statutes of the moon and stars for the light of the night (31:35). In David: Jehovah, the day is Thine, the night also is Thine; Thou hast prepared the light and the sun (Ps. 74:16).

If I shall not have set8 My covenant of day and night, the statutes of heaven and earth, then I reject also the seed of Jacob and David (33:20, 21, 25, 26). “The covenants of the day and of the night” mean all the statutes of the church prescribed unto the sons of Israel in the Word, by which they had conjunction with heaven and through heaven with the Lord. These are called “the covenant of the day and of the night,” because they are for heaven and also for the church, the spiritual things that are represented and signified are for heaven, and the natural things that represent and signify are for the church; therefore “the covenants of the day and of the night” are here called “the statutes of heaven and earth,” and “the covenant of the night” is called “the statutes of the moon and stars”; “to render void” signifies not to keep.

Even the darkness shall not make darkness before Thee; but the night shall be light as the day; as the darkness so shall be the light (Ps. 139:11, 12). This signifies that the natural man as well as the spiritual is enlightened by the Lord. Natural light is signified by “darkness” and “night,” and spiritual light by “light” and “day.” “The night shall be light as the day, and as the darkness so shall be the light,” has the same signification as in Isaiah: The light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun (30:26). These things have been cited to make known that spiritual light is signified by “the day should not shine for the third part of it,” and natural light by “the night likewise”; thus that these expressions have a similar signification as “light from the sun and light from the moon.” 528.

That “angels” in the Word mean Divine truth proceeding from the Lord, thus the Lord Himself in relation to Divine truth, may be seen above (n. 130, 200, 302), here the Lord manifesting what the church is to be in the last times in respect to the reception of Divine truth.

From this it can be seen that “I saw, and I heard one angel flying in midheaven,” signifies the enlightenment of all who are in the heavens respecting the state of the church at its end. Enlightenment respecting the state of the church at its end is meant, because this is what is treated of in what follows. “To see and to hear” signifies to open the understanding to perceive, because “to see” signifies to understand, and “to hear” to perceive (that “to see” signifies to understand, see above, n. 260; and that “to hear” signifies to perceive, also above n. 14, 108). [2] “To fly” signifies, in reference to the Lord, to enlighten, because “to fly” is said of the understanding, and of the extension of its vision round about, therefore in reference to the Lord, “to fly” signifies the enlightenment of the understanding. That in reference to the Lord, “to fly” signifies omnipresence, may be seen above (n. 282); consequently it signifies also enlightenment, for where the Lord is present there is enlightenment. “To fly” has the same signification in David: God rode upon a cherub, He did fly, and was borne upon the wings of the wind (Ps. 18:10; 2 Sam. 22:11). A “cherub” signifies the inmost heaven, “to ride” signifies to give understanding and to enlighten; “to fly” and “to be borne upon the wings of the wind” have a like meaning; but “to ride” here signifies to give understanding to and to enlighten here the inmost heaven,"

[2] That “woe” signifies lamentation over calamity, danger, hardship, destruction can be seen from passages in the Word where it occurs; but here it means lamentation over the aversion from good and truth, and consequent damnation, because this is what is treated of in what follows; and as the aversion from good and truth becomes successively more grievous in the church even to its end, it is said three times, each one standing for the successively increasing grievousness of the evil. This can be seen from the following, where it is said: The first woe is past; behold there come yet two woes hereafter (Rev. 9:12). And afterwards: The second woe is past, behold the third woe cometh quickly (Rev. 11:14). [3] That “woe” signifies in the Word lamentation over various occurrences, especially over the evils that devastate the church, can be seen from many passages therein. As in Matthew: Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! (23:13, 14, 16, 23, 25, 27, 29). In Luke: Woe unto that man through whom the Son of man is betrayed! (22:22)."

It is to be known that “three years” has a similar signification as “three months,” “three weeks,” “three days,” and “three hours,” since in the spiritual sense, times signify states, and “three times,” whether greater or less, a full state. [3] In the same: Like as my servant Isaiah hath gone naked and barefoot three years, a sign and wonder upon Egypt and upon Cush, so shall the king of Assyria lead the captivity of Egypt and the crowd of Cush that is to be carried away, boys and old men, naked and barefoot (Isa. 20:3, 4). By “Egypt” and “Cush,” Egypt and Cush are not meant, but “Egypt” means the external or natural in respect to knowledge, and “Cush” the external or natural in respect to worship, and when this natural has no internal spiritual, it also has no truth or good, for all the truth and all the good belonging to the natural or external man is from influx through the spiritual man from the Lord; and when the natural or external man has no truth or good it is like, in respect to the things in it, a man “naked and barefoot.” That there will then be only reasonings from falsities, and that these will destroy, is signified by “the king of Assyria shall lead the captivity of Egypt and the crowd of Cush that is to be carried away, naked and barefoot.” That all innocence and all wisdom will perish is signified by “the boys and old men whom the king of Assyria shall lead away”; their total and complete destruction was represented by the prophet’s going “three years naked and barefoot,” “three years” signifying an entire period from beginning to end, consequently total destruction."

In the third month after going out from Egypt they came to Mount Sinai (Exod. 19:1). They were commanded to be ready against the third day, for on the third day Jehovah would come down upon Mount Sinai (Exod. 19:11, 15, 16, 18).

He said that He would be raised up the third day (Matt. 16:21; 17:22, 23; 20:18, 19; Luke 18:32, 33; 24:46). He said that he would destroy the temple of God, and build it in three days (Matt. 26:61; 27:40; John 2:19, 20). Jesus in Gethsemane prayed three times (Matt. 26:39, 42, 44). Jesus was crucified at the third hour (Mark 15:25). Then there was darkness over all the land three hours, from the sixth hour to the ninth, when He said, It is finished, and expired (Matt. 27:45; Mark 15:33, 37; John 19:30). The Lord rose again on the third day (Matt. 28:1; Mark 16:2; Luke 24:1; John 20:1). [6] From this it can be seen that the number “three” signifies what is finished or complete to the end, consequently an entire period, greater or less, from beginning to end. From this simple number many composite numbers derive their significations, as 6, 9, 12, 60, 72, which, from three, signify all truths and goods in the complex; in like manner the numbers 30, 300, 3000; for, as said above in this article, the composite numbers derive their significations from the simple numbers of which they are composed. Moreover, it is to be known that in the Word the number “three” is predicated of truths, and “two” and “four” of goods; for the reason that “two” and “four” signify conjunction, while “three” signifies fullness, and spiritual conjunction is love, and all good is of love; while spiritual fullness is formed by truths. One who does not know that all numbers in the Word are significative, when the numbers “two and three” or “three and four” are mentioned in the Word, has no other thought or belief than that two or three, or a few, are meant, instead of all who are in good and truth, as in the following passages."

This treats of the vastation of the church, and is said of the few remaining who are in good and truth; comparison is made with the shaking of an olive tree, because an “olive tree” signifies the church in respect to the good of love, and “branches” the truths therefrom; “two three” signifies the few that are in good and in truths therefrom, “two” meaning good, and “three” truths; and “four five” signifies the few who are in good, “four” meaning those who are good, and “five” a few.

Because of this signification of these numbers, therefore it is said “two three,” “four five,” and not two and three, four and five.

This, in like manner, treats of the vastation of the church in respect to good; that every good will perish is meant by “in all the land two parts therein shall be cut off and shall expire,” “in all the land” meaning in all the church, and “two parts” signifying every good. That something of truth would remain, but scarcely any genuine truth, is signified by “the third part shall be left therein; yet I will lead the third part through the fire and will prove them,” “the third part” signifying the remaining truths; these must be proved whether they be genuine, which is signified by “they shall be led through the fire”; “to prove by fire” means by affection which is of love; if truth is not in accord with this it is not genuine truth, “fire” in the Word signifying love. When the good of love perishes in the church, truth becomes not truth, because all truth derives its essence from good. [10] This makes evident what is signified by the Lord’s words in Matthew: Where two and three are gathered together in My name, there am I in the midst of them (18:20). Here two and three are not meant, but those who are in good and in truths therefrom; neither does the Lord’s “name” mean His name, but all the good of love and truth of faith by which He is worshiped (see above, n. 102, 135).

Who cannot see that the numbers five, two, and three, would not have been used here unless they had been significative? In the Word, when “two” and “three” follow, “five” signifies all such; but when “ten” or “twenty” precedes or follows, “five” signifies some and few.

Who does not see that it would be contrary to the Divine justice to visit the iniquity of the parents upon the sons even to the third and fourth generation? For the Lord teaches: The soul that sinneth, it shall die; the son shall not bear the iniquity of the parent, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son; the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him (Ezek. 18:20; Deut. 24:16; 2 Kings 14:6)."

This is evident from the signification of “sounding with a trumpet,” as being influx out of heaven, and a change of the state of the church (of which above, n. 502a); here that the state of the church was wholly changed, since it was said just above respecting these last three times the angels sounded, “Woe, woe, woe, to those that dwell on the earth, from the remaining voices2 of the trumpet of the three angels who are about to sound.” The change described in what now follows is that all truth was destroyed, and that the falsity that took its place opened the hells, from which falsities flow forth. 535.

For those who deny truths are not among those who are in “the former heaven,” and who are cast down therefrom into hell at the day of the Last Judgment, for such are cast down thither immediately after death. But in this book those who, for various reasons, falsify truths are treated of, for such made for themselves a heaven that was afterwards destroyed. Those falsify the knowledges of truth and good from the Word who acknowledge the Word but apply it to favor their loves and to favor principles that are from self- intelligence, thus they turn the truths of the Word into falsities, and thus the knowledges of good and truth with them perish.

The dragon with his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth (12:4). In Daniel: The horn of the he-goat waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and some of the host and of the stars it cast down to the ground and trampled upon them (8:10). In Matthew: Immediately after the affliction of those days the sun shall be darkened, and the stars shall fall from heaven (24:29).

So in Revelation: The great dragon was cast down to the earth, and his angels with him, and their place was not found anymore in heaven (12:8, 9).

[3] Because heaven is conjoined with man by means of the Word, those who falsify the truths of the Word by interpretations to confirm evils of life avert themselves from heaven and turn themselves to hell. For heaven is in the spiritual sense of the Word, and man is in its natural sense; consequently heaven is conjoined with the world by means of the Word. For this reason the Word is also called a “covenant” and a covenant is a conjunction. This is why those who apply the Word to evils of life and to the false principles that are from self-intelligence cannot be conjoined with heaven; and those who are not conjoined with heaven are conjoined with hell; for man must be either in heaven or in hell; it is not permitted him to hang between the two. But those who apply the Word to such falsities as do not disagree with the good of life, such as exist with the upright Gentiles that do not have the Word and with the simple in the church who believe in the Lord and lead a good life, because from their falsities they look to good, have such falsities applied by the Lord to good, and are turned towards heaven; for the essential thing in heaven is the good of life, which is the same as the good of love to the Lord and the good of charity towards the neighbor; for in heaven everyone has perception of truth, intelligence, and wisdom, in accordance with that good.

Few of the spirits know this, because few know anything about correspondences, for being in them they do not reflect upon them. It is the same as it is with men in the world; few of whom know what their affections and thoughts are, because being in them they thence do not reflect upon them, and yet they are innumerable, as can be seen from the results of mental analysis set forth by many of the learned, all which are operations of the mind. This makes clear why a “key” is mentioned, and that it signifies admission and opening. [3] So elsewhere in the Word, as in Matthew: Jesus said to Peter, I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of the heavens (16:19). (This may be seen explained above, n. 206.) Also in Isaiah (22:20, 22), where the like is said of Eliakim (this, too, is explained above, n. 206). Also in Revelation: I have the keys of hell and of death (1:18). (Respecting this see above, n. 86.) Again: These things saith the Holy, the True, He that hath the key of David, He that openeth and no one shutteth, and shutteth and no one openeth (Rev. 3:7)."

And he laid hold on the dragon, and bound him a thousand years (20:1, 2). (This will be explained hereafter.) And in Luke: Woe unto you lawyers! For3 ye take away the keys of heaven;4 ye enter not in yourselves, and those entering in ye hinder (11:52). Those were called “lawyers” who searched the Scriptures and taught how their contents must be understood; and as it is by means of the Sacred Scripture or the Word that there is communication and consequent conjunction with heaven, as was said in the article just above, and as truths are what open the communication, and the goods of truth are what constitute conjunction, while truths falsified, which in themselves are the falsities of evil, are what cause disjunction, so they are said “to take away the keys of heaven,” that is, that they are able by means of truths to open communication with heaven to those whom they teach; but because they perverted the Word by applications to their loves and to false principles therefrom, therefore it is said, “Ye enter not in yourselves, and those entering in ye hinder.” From this it can be seen that “the key that opened the pit” signifies communication and conjunction with the hells by means of the falsities into which the truths of the Word are turned by those who falsify them by applying them to the evils of life and to the false principles derived therefrom. 537a. Verse 2. And he opened the pit of the abyss, signifies communication and conjunction with the hells where and from which are such falsities. This is evident from the signification of “to open” as here being to communicate and conjoin (of which presently); and from the signification of “the pit of the abyss” as being the hell where and from which are such falsities. These are called in the Word “pits (or wells) of the abyss” because a “pit” (or well) signifies the Word in the sense of the letter and the truth of doctrine therefrom, but in the contrary sense the Word falsified and the falsity of doctrine therefrom; and the “abyss” (or depth of"

This signifies the hell where those are who have falsified the truths of the Word by applying its truths to the evils of life, because such hells appear to those who are above like seas, and those who are in them appear to be in their depths. These seas or hells I have also seen, and also those who are in their depths; but those who spoke with me therefrom declared that they were not in waters, but on dry ground. This shows that the waters of these seas are appearances corresponding to the falsities in which those are who are in them. The waters of these seas are grosser and denser according to the falsifications, and the depths also differ in accordance with the evils that have been falsified. [2] What “abyss” signifies in the Word will be told below. “To open the pit of the abyss” signifies communication and conjunction with such hells, because the hells are not opened except when evil spirits enter, which takes place when they have fulfilled their time in the world of spirits; for it is not allowed to any evil spirit to go out from hell when he has been once cast into it; if he goes out he nevertheless immediately falls back into it. But every man is conjoined with spirits who are in the world of spirits, who are such as he himself is; consequently a man who falsifies the Word by applying it to evils of life and to falsities confirming those evils, is conjoined with like spirits, and by them with the hells that are in like falsities. Every man after death becomes a spirit, and he then becomes at once attached either with infernal or with heavenly societies, according to his life in the world; and all spirits, before they are cast down into hell or raised up into heaven, are first in the world of spirits, and they are then with men who are living in the world, evil spirits with the evil, and good spirits with the good. Through these man has communication and conjunction either with the hells or with the heavens. This makes clear that “to open the pit” does not signify to open hell, but to have communication, and by communication conjunction with hell. From everyone of the hells falsities of evil exhale in great abundance, and in these falsities are the spirits who are in the world of spirits, and at the same time the men who are in like falsities in our world. No spirit or man can be anywhere else than where the love of his life is, for that which a man loves, that he wills, that he thinks, and that he"

[3] A “pit” (or well) signifies the Word and the truth of doctrine, and in the contrary sense the Word falsified and the falsity of doctrine therefrom, because “pits” contain waters, and “waters” signify truths, and in the contrary sense falsities (as shown above, n. 71, 483, 518). That a “pit” (or well) has these two meanings can be seen from the following passages in the Word. In Moses: They journeyed to Beer; this is the well whereof Jehovah said unto Moses, Gather the people together, and I will give it5 waters. Then Israel sang this song, Come up, O well; answer ye from it; the princes digged the well, the willing ones of the people delved it, through the lawgiver, with their staves (Num. 21:16–18). That this “well” signifies the truth of doctrine from the Word is evident from the song that Israel sang respecting it: “Come up, O well, answer ye from it,” signifies that doctrine from the Word should teach truth and that they should receive it, “Come up, O well,” signifying the calling forth of truth, and “answer ye from it” reception and instruction; “the princes digged the well, the willing ones of the people delved it, through the lawgiver, with their staves,” signifies that those who are in truths and in the goods of truths are enlightened by the Lord, and from Him by means of the Word search out and collect doctrine; “princes” signifying those who are in truths; “the willing ones of the people” those who are in the goods of truth; “to dig” to search out and gather up; “lawgiver” the Lord in respect to the Word and the doctrine from the Word, and “staves” the potency and powers of the mind, here from the Lord by means of the Word, because it is said, “by the lawgiver.” This makes clear what “well” here signifies. “Israel sang a song” respecting it, because “Beer,” in the original, means a well, and in the spiritual sense “a well” signifies the Word, and doctrine from the Word; likewise “Beersheba,” which is often mentioned in the historical parts of the Word.

The Lord spoke with the Samaritan woman at that well, because “the Samaritan woman” meant the church to be established with the Gentiles, and “the Samaritans” who are also mentioned in other passages, mean the Gentiles that were to receive doctrine from the Lord and respecting the Lord. This “well” signifies doctrine from the Word, the “water” the truth of doctrine, and “the Lord sitting at that well” the Word or Divine truth. That salvation is from the Lord by means of Divine truth from the Word is signified by “the water which He would give should become a fountain of water springing up unto everlasting life.” [5] Something similar to what is signified by “the well of Jacob” is signified also by: The wells that the servants of Abraham and the servants of Isaac dug, respecting which they strove with the servants of Abimelech (Gen. 21:25; 26:15, 18–22, 25, 32). The wells that the servants of Abraham and the servants of Isaac dug signify the truths of doctrine, because by “Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,” in the Word, the Lord is meant; but “Abimelech” king of Gerar, or of the Philistines, means those who place salvation in truths alone without the good of life, as those do at the present day who are in faith alone. And as every truth is from good, or everything of faith from charity, and as those who separate and exclude good from truth, or charity from faith, possess no genuine truth of doctrine, but every truth of the Word with them is like the meaning of the mere words with no perception of the thing, thus like a shell without a kernel, so they dispute about the truths of faith; this was represented and signified by the strifes of the servants of Abimelech with the servants of Abraham and of Isaac respecting the wells.

[6] In Luke: Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a well; and will not straightway draw him out on a Sabbath day? (14:5). This was a statute with the Israelitish and Jewish nation, because of the spiritual sense contained in it; for all the statutes, judgments, and commandments given to the sons of Israel signified spiritual things belonging to heaven and to the church; so this statute signified that if anyone falls into falsity or into evil, he must be led out of it by means of the truth that is taught from the Lord on the Sabbath day. The “well” here means falsity and the evil of falsity; “an ass and an ox” signify the truth and good of the natural man; “to fall into a well” signifies into falsity and into the evil of falsity; “to be drawn out on a Sabbath day” signifies to be instructed and thus led out of these; for “the Sabbath day” signifies here the Lord in relation to instruction and doctrine, therefore He calls Himself “Lord of the Sabbath.” (That an “ass” signifies the truth of the natural man, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 2781, 5741; and that an “ox” signifies the good of the natural man, n. 2180, 2566, 9134.) 537b.

Here “pit” has the same signification as well. [8] So in Matthew: Blind leaders of the blind. When the blind leads the blind, both fall into the pit (15:14; Luke 6:39). This the Lord said to the scribes and Pharisees, who understood nothing of truth, although they had the Word, in which are all Divine truths; and because they taught falsities and their falsities were also believed by the people, they are called “blind leaders of the blind”; those are called in the Word “blind” who do not understand truth; and because “pit” signifies falsity, it is said that “they both fall into it.” [9] In David: Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink; let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the depths of waters. Let not the billows of waters overwhelm me, neither let the abyss swallow me up, and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me (Ps. 69:14, 15). Here very evidently the “pit” signifies the hell where and from which are falsities, for it is said, “let not the pit shut her mouth upon me,” that is, let not the hell from which are falsities, or falsities from hell, wholly possess me, that I may not escape; “deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink,” means out of the evil of falsity, lest I perish; “let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the depths of waters,” signifies to be delivered from evils and falsities that are from the hells, “them that hate” meaning evils therefrom, and “depths of waters” falsities therefrom; “neither let the abyss swallow me up” signifies, let not the hell where are the falsities of evil, or the falsities of evil from hell, do this.

This is said of those who simulate good affections when they utter falsities by which they lead astray; “to make the mouth smooth as butter” signifies a simulation of good by means of affections, “butter” signifying the good of external affection. “Their words are softer than oil” has a like signification, “oil” meaning the good of internal affection; “yet are they drawn swords” signifies, and yet they are falsities destroying good and truth, “drawn swords” meaning falsities destroying; “but Thou, O God, wilt cast them down into the well of the pit,” signifies into the hell where there are destructive falsities of that kind. [11] As “pits” have nearly the same signification in the Word as “wells,” for they are like wells, I will also quote some passages respecting them. In Jeremiah: Their nobles have sent their little ones to the waters; they came to the pits, they found no waters; they returned with their vessels empty (14:3). “Nobles” mean those who lead and teach others, “little ones” those who are led and taught, and “waters” truths; this makes evident what is signified by “Their nobles have sent their little ones to the waters”; “the pits in which there were no waters” signify doctrinals in which there are no truths; this makes evident what is signified by “they came to the pits, they found no waters”; that they had no knowledge (scientia) or understanding of truth is signified by “they returned with their vessels empty,” “vessels” signifying in the Word things recipient of truth, and thus things of knowledge and understanding.

[13] In Jeremiah: My people have committed two evils; they have forsaken Me, the fountain of living waters, to hew out for themselves pits, broken pits, that cannot hold waters (2:13). “To hew out pits, broken pits, that hold no waters,” signifies to hatch out doctrinals from self-intelligence, which are false because they are from man’s own (proprium), for man’s own is nothing but evil, and because it is evil, falsity is brought forth from it, for evil can bring forth nothing but falsity.

[15] In Isaiah: He that leadeth forth shall hasten that it may be opened, that he may not die in the pit, and that his bread fail not (51:14). This is said of the Lord. His coming is meant by “he that leadeth forth shall hasten”; deliverance from the falsities of ignorance is signified by “that he die not in the pit,” thus “pit” here has a similar signification as “the pit in which were the bound,” above; that spiritual instruction and nourishment shall not fail is signified by “that his bread fail not,” for “bread” means all spiritual food, and spiritual food means instruction in truths and goods, from which come intelligence and wisdom.

It must be remembered that in the spiritual world truths also appear like waters, but like limpid and pure waters. This is because there are three degrees of man’s life, as there are three heavens. Those in whom the third degree is opened are in an atmosphere pure like ether; those who are in the third or inmost heaven are in such an atmosphere; those in whom only the second degree is opened are in an atmosphere as it were aerial; those who are in the second or middle heaven are in such an atmosphere; but those in whom the first degree only is opened are in a kind of watery, rare, and pure atmosphere; those who are in the first or ultimate heaven are in such an atmosphere. This is because interior perceptions and thoughts, as being more perfect, correspond to a purity of atmosphere like that in which they are, for they pour themselves forth from every angel and still more from every angelic society, and present a corresponding sphere, which sphere is manifested in a purity like that of the perceptions and thoughts of the angels, that is, of their intelligence and wisdom. This sphere appears, as has been said, like an atmosphere, like an ethereal atmosphere in the inmost heaven, like an aerial atmosphere in the middle heaven, and like a rare watery atmosphere in the ultimate heaven. This makes evident that a kind of watery atmosphere corresponds to natural thought and perception, but a rare watery atmosphere corresponds to spiritual-natural thought and perception in which are the angels of the ultimate heaven; but a dense watery atmosphere, approaching either to black or ruddy, corresponds to natural thought in which there is nothing spiritual, and natural thought in which there is nothing spiritual those have who are in the hells where falsities prevail, for all who are there are merely natural and sensual.

From the wind of Thy nostrils the waters were piled up, the floods stood upright as a heap, and the abysses were congealed in the heart of the sea (Exod. 15:4, 5, 8).

This is said of Pharaoh and Assyria; and “Pharaoh” has a similar signification as “Egypt,” namely, knowledge destroying the truth of the church by application to falsities, and “Assyria” signifies reasoning from falsities; that those who are such are cast down into hell, where such falsities and reasonings from falsities are, is signified by “he shall go down into hell, and shall be covered with the abyss”; from which it is evident that the “abyss” means the hell where and from which are the falsities of evil. [7] In Micah: God will turn back, He will have compassion upon us, He will subdue our iniquities, and He will cast all our sins into the depths of the sea (7:19). Because “the depths of the sea,” the same as “abysses,” mean the hells where and from which are evils and falsities, it is said, “He will cast all our sins into the depths of the sea.” [8] In Ezekiel: When I shall make thee a desolate city like the cities that are not inhabited; when I shall make the abyss to come up against thee, and many waters shall cover thee; then will I make thee to go down with them that go down into the pit, to the people of an age, and I will make thee to dwell in the land of the lower parts, in the desolations from an age, with them that go down into the pit, that thou have no habitation (26:19, 20)."

This shows what is signified by “making to dwell in the land of the lower parts, in the desolations from an age, with them that go down into the pit, that thou have no habitation,” “to have no habitation” signifying here not to be in any truths, because not in good, for such do not dwell in houses but in pits. 538b.

[11] In Jonah: Out of the belly of hell have I cried; Thou hast heard my voice. Thou hadst cast me into the depth, even into the heart of the seas; and the river was round about me; all Thy billows and Thy waves passed over me. The waters enclosed me about even to the soul; the abyss encompassed me round about, the sedge was wrapped about my head.

And because it is by the overflow of evils and falsities that come up out of hell, and as it were overwhelm, that temptations exist, it is said that “out of the belly of hell he cried,” and that “he was cast into the depth, even into the heart of the seas,” which signifies hell; “the river and the waters that enclosed him,” and “the billows and waves that passed over,” signify the evils and falsities from hell; “the abyss that encompassed round about,” signifies the hells where and from which are the falsities; “the cuttings off of the mountains to which he went down,” signify the hells where and from which are evils; that the Lord was as it were bound by these is signified by “the sedge wrapped about the head,” and “the bars of the earth that were upon him,” “wrapped by sedge” signifying to be bound as it were by falsities, and “the bars of the earth” signifying to be bound"

[12] The following passages in David have a like signification: Abyss calleth unto abyss at the voice of Thy waterspouts; all Thy breakers and Thy waves have passed over me (Ps. 42:7). The waters are come even to my soul. I have sunk in mire of depths, there is no standing; I have come into depths of waters, and the billow overwhelms me. Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink; let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the depths of waters. Let not the flood of waters overwhelm me, and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me (Ps. 69:1, 2, 14, 15). Return, quicken me; return and make me to come up out of the depths of the earth (Ps. 71:20). I have been counted with them that go down into the pit; neglected among the dead, like the slain that lie down in the grave, whom Thou rememberest no more; and from Thy hand they are cut off. Thou hast laid me in the pit of the lower parts, in dark places, in the depths (Ps. 88:4–6). These passages in David describe the Lord’s temptations when He was in the world, by which He subjugated the hells and glorified His Human; “waves” and “billows” signify evils and falsities; and “abysses” and “depths of the sea,” likewise “the pit” signify the hells where and from which are evils and falsities; for as was said above, temptations are like immersions in the hells and obsessions by evils and falsities. This is signified by the lamentations in David in many places, and also in the Prophets; for in the spiritual sense of the Word there is much that treats of the Lord’s temptations by which He subjugated the hells and arranged all things in order in the heavens and in the hells, and by which He glorified His Human; these things are especially meant in Luke (24:44) by the things predicted “in the Prophets and in the Psalms of David,” respecting the Lord, and fulfilled by Him."

The sea has come up upon Babylon; she is covered with the multitude of the waves thereof (51:42).

The demons that had possession of the man besought Jesus that He would not command them to depart into the abyss, therefore He suffered them to enter into the swine (Luke 8:31, 33; Matt. 8:31, 32). And in the following passages of Revelation: The beast that came up out of the abyss and made war (11:7). The beast that thou sawest was and is not, and is about to come up out of the abyss (17:8). I saw an angel coming down out of heaven, having the key of the abyss, and a great chain upon his hand. And he bound the dragon a thousand years, and cast him into the abyss (20:1–3). In these passages, also, “the abyss” and “the depth of the sea” signify the hell where and from which are the falsities of evil; for the reason that the evil spirits who are there, and who while they lived as men in the world were in the falsities of evil, seem to dwell as it were in the bottom of the seas, and this the more deeply according to the grievousness of the evil from which was their falsity. 538c.

And there went up a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace, signifies dense falsities therefrom out of the evils of earthly and corporeal loves. This is evident from the signification of “smoke,” as being the falsity of evil (of which presently); from the signification of “the pit of the abyss,” as being the hell where those are who have falsified the Word (respecting which see above, n. 537); and from the signification of “a great furnace,” as being the evils of earthly and corporeal loves out of which such falsities break forth (of which in the following article). “Smoke” signifies the falsity of evil, because it proceeds from fire, and “fire” signifies the loves of self and the world and thence all evils; consequently the hells that are in falsities from the evils of those loves, and still more the hells where those are who have falsified the Word by adapting it to favor those loves, appear in a fire like that of a great furnace, from which a dense smoke mingled with fire goes up. I have also seen those hells, and it was evident that it was the loves with those who were in them that presented the appearance of such a fire, and the falsities flowing forth from those loves that presented the appearance of the fiery smoke. But there is no such appearance to those who are therein, for they are in these loves and in the falsities therefrom, their life is in them, and it is by these that they are tormented in many ways, and not by such fire and smoke as are in our natural world. (This can be seen better in the chapter in the work Heaven and Hell, n. 566–575, which treats of Infernal Fire and the Gnashing of Teeth.)

These falsities are what are signified by the “smoke” seen rising from Sodom and Gomorrah. [3] In the same: And the sun went down, and there was dense darkness, and behold a furnace of smoke, and a torch of fire that passed through between those pieces (Gen. 15:17). This was said of Abraham’s posterity from Jacob, as can be seen from what precedes in that chapter; “the sun went down” signifies the last time, when consummation takes place; “and there was dense darkness” signifies when evil takes the place of good and falsity the place of truth; “behold a furnace of smoke” signifies the densest falsity from evils; “a torch of fire” signifies the heat of cupidities; “it passed through between the pieces” signifies that these separated them from the Lord. (But this may be seen more fully explained in Arcana Coelestia, n. 1858–1862.)

And because that people was in earthly and corporeal loves, and in falsities of evil therefrom, the Lord appeared to them from Mount Sinai as a devouring fire, and as the smoke of a furnace. (That the sons of Jacob were such has been shown in many places in Arcana Coelestia, as may be seen from what is brought together in the New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine, n. 248; and that the Lord appears to everyone according to his quality, as a vivifying and recreating fire to those who are in good, and as a consuming fire to those who are in evil, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 934, 1861, 6832, 8814, 8819, 9434, 10551; what the other particulars in the passages cited signify may be seen in the same work where the book of Exodus is explained.) 539b.

This does not mean that smoke and a devouring fire went up from Jehovah, for there is no anger in Him; but it is so said because the Lord so appears to those who are in falsities and evils, for they regard Him from their falsities and evils. [6] The like is signified by the following in the same: He looketh on the earth and it trembleth; He toucheth the mountains and they smoke (Ps. 104:32). Bow Thy heavens, O Jehovah, and come down; touch the mountains, that they may smoke (Ps. 144:5)."

[10] In the same: As smoke is driven away Thou wilt drive away; as wax melteth before the fire the wicked shall perish before God (Ps. 68:2). The destruction of the wicked is compared to smoke driven away by the wind, and to wax that melts before the fire, because “smoke” signifies falsities, and “fire” evils. [11] In Isaiah: The heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall wax old like a garment (51:6). “Smoke” here signifies falsity, by which those who were in the former heaven would be destroyed; and “the garment waxing old” signifies truth destroyed by the falsities of evil. Comparison is made with smoke vanishing away, and with a garment waxing old, because comparisons in the Word are also correspondences, and in like manner significative.

This describes the doctrinals that are from self-intelligence, in which are the evils of falsity and the falsities of evil.

[13] “Smoke” also signifies falsity in other passages in Revelation, as in the following: Out of the mouth of the horses went forth fire and smoke and brimstone; and by these was the third part of men slain, by the fire, and by the smoke, and by the brimstone (9:17, 18). The smoke of their torment goeth up unto the ages of the ages (14:11). The smoke of Babylon goeth up unto the ages of the ages (19:3). [14] Because “fire” signifies love in both senses, both celestial love and infernal love, and therefore “smoke” signifies that which flows forth from love—falsity, which is from infernal love, and truth, which is from heavenly love—therefore “smoke” signifies in a good sense holy truth. This is what “smoke from the fire of the incense offerings” signifies, as may be seen above (n. 494), as also in the following passages. In Isaiah: Jehovah will create over every dwelling place of Mount Zion, and over her convocations, a cloud by day and a smoke and the brightness of a flame of fire by night; for over all the glory shall be a veiling (4:5).

The smoke of the incense offerings with the prayers of the saints ascended out of the angel’s hand before God (8:4). 540a. Since it is said that “there went up a smoke out of the pit as the smoke of a great furnace,” and it has so far been shown that “smoke” signifies dense falsity, it is important also to show that a “furnace” signifies the evils of earthly and corporeal loves, and thus that “smoke as the smoke of a great furnace” signifies dense falsities from those loves. It is also from appearances in the spiritual world that a “furnace” signifies such loves; for when the hells in which those loves prevail are looked into, they appear like furnaces glowing with fire; and over them smoke appears, such as goes up from furnaces and is seen in conflagrations. From this it is that “furnaces” signify in the Word either the hells, or a company of men, or the man himself, in whom such loves and cupidities reign, or what is the same, where the evils that flow forth from these prevail. [2] Such is the signification of “furnaces” (fornaces et camini) and “ovens” (furni et clibani) in the following passages. In Matthew: The Son of man shall send forth His angels, and they shall gather out of His kingdom all things that cause stumbling, and them that do iniquity; and shall send them into the furnace of fire. In the consummation of the age the angels shall come forth, and shall sever the wicked from the midst of the righteous, and shall cast them into the furnace of fire; there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth (13:41, 42, 49, 50). Evidently here “a furnace (caminus seu fornax) of fire,” means the hells; “the consummation of the age” is the last time of the church, when judgment takes place. That the evil must then be separated from the good and be cast into hell is signified by “the angels shall gather all things that cause stumbling, and them that do iniquity,” and “they shall sever the wicked from the midst of the righteous, and shall cast them into the furnace of fire.” Hell is called “the"

That “infernal fire” signifies torment from these loves may be seen in the work Heaven and Hell (n. 566–575). [3] In Malachi: Behold, the day cometh burning as an oven, in which all that sin presumptuously, and every worker of wickedness shall be stubble, and the day that cometh shall set them on fire (4:1). This, too, was said of the last time of the church, and the Last Judgment at that time; both these are signified by “the day that cometh.” The “oven” means the hell where those are who confirm themselves in falsities by doctrine, and confirm themselves in evils from earthly and corporeal loves by their life; that such on account of their own loves will perish is meant by “all who sin presumptuously, and every worker of wickedness shall be stubble, and the oven shall set them on fire,” “all who sin presumptuously” meaning those who by doctrine confirm themselves in falsities, and “the worker of wickedness” those who by life confirm themselves in evil. [4] In Hosea: By their evil they make glad the king, and by their lies the princes. They are all adulterers, like an oven kindled by the baker; the raiser ceaseth from kneading the dough until it be fermented.

They are all hot as an oven, and they will devour their judges; all their kings will fall; not one among them calleth unto Me. Ephraim is a cake not turned (7:3–8). In the spiritual sense this describes the sons of Jacob, that from the love of self and of the world they turned every good into evil, and thence every truth into falsity; “the king whom they make glad by wickedness,” signifies all falsity from evil, for a “king” signifies truth from good, and in the contrary sense falsity from evil; and the “princes whom they make glad by lies” signify the chief falsities. That from their loves they perverted goods and truths is signified by “they are all adulterers, like an oven kindled by the baker,” “to"

That consequently there will be nothing but the evils of those loves that falsities favor is signified by, “the baker sleepeth all the night; in the morning he burneth as a fire of flame, they are all hot as an oven.” Such are compared to a “baker” and an “oven,” because they form doctrine out of falsities as a baker makes loaves and cakes in an oven. That they thus destroy all goods and truths that they have from the Word is signified by, “they will devour their judges, and all their kings will fall,” “judges” signifying the goods of truth, and “kings” the truths themselves; that such is the result because they wish to be wise of themselves and not from the Lord, is signified by “not one among them that called unto Me.” That these words have some such meaning can be seen merely from common intuition, but that the particulars signify and describe such things, that is, that “kings,” “princes,” “judges,” and “adulterers,” also an “oven” and a “baker” mean what has just been said, can be seen only from the internal sense. Moreover, those who bring together truths or falsities so that they cohere appear in the spiritual world as bakers kneading dough, with an oven also near them. [5] In Lamentations: Our skins are black like an oven because of the tempests of famine (5:10). This is a lamentation over the loss of truth and inundation of falsity; “famine” signifies a loss and lack of truth (see above, n. 386e); and “a tempest of famine,” complete lack, and also an inundation of falsities, for where there are no truths there will be falsities; “tempests” have a similar signification in the Word as"

[6] In Ezekiel: The house of Israel has become as dross unto Me; all of them are brass and tin and iron and lead in the midst of a furnace; they have become the dross of silver. Behold, I gather you into the midst of Jerusalem, a gathering of silver and brass and iron and lead and tin will I gather you, into the midst of the furnace, to blow fire upon it to melt it; so will I bring you together in Mine anger and in My wrath, and I will leave you there and melt you. Like a casting of silver in the midst of the furnace, so shall ye be melted in the midst thereof (22:18–22). This describes the false doctrinals which the Jews and Israelites brought together from the sense of the letter of the Word, which they adapted merely to themselves and to their loves; these are called the “dross of silver,” because “silver” signifies the truth of the Word, and “dross” nothing of truth, or what is abstracted from truth, which is rejected. The things of the sense of the letter of the Word are signified by “brass, tin, iron, and lead,” because these signify the goods and truths of the natural man; and the things of the Word that are contained in the sense of its letter are for the natural man. And because from this sense they framed their false doctrinals, which were traditions, it is said “they shall be melted together”; and because they were adapted to their loves, which were loves of self and of the world, it is said that “He would gather them into the midst of the furnace, to blow fire upon it to melt it,” “fire” signifying those loves. And because their doctrinals are meant, it is said that “He would gather them into the midst of Jerusalem,” “Jerusalem” signifying the church in respect to doctrine, thus also the doctrine of the church. [7] In Moses: The sun went down and it was dense darkness, and behold an oven of smoke and a torch of fire that passed through between the pieces (Gen. 15:17)."

For Abraham was eager that his posterity should rule over the whole land of Canaan, and because the Lord foresaw that the church would be instituted in that nation, He made a covenant with Abraham. Nevertheless what they were to be is predicted in this that was seen. [8] In Nahum: Draw thee waters for the siege, strengthen thy fortresses; go into the mire, and tread the pitch, repair the brick kiln (fornax). There shall the fire devour thee, the sword shall cut thee off (3:14, 15). This describes the destruction of truth by the falsities of evil; the “waters for the siege” mean the falsities by which they endeavor to destroy truths; “to strengthen the fortresses” signifies to fortify falsities by such things as appear like truths; “to go into the mire and tread the pitch” signifies to make them appear to cling together, “pitch” meaning falsity from evil conjoining; “to repair the brick kiln” signifies to repair the doctrine framed out of falsified truths and fictions, “bricks” signifying the falsities that are fabricated and do not cohere with truths; “fire shall devour thee” signifies that they will be destroyed by the evils of their loves, and “the sword shall cut thee off” signifies that they will be destroyed by falsities. [9] In Jeremiah: Take great stones in thy hand, and hide them in the brick kiln which is near the entrance of Pharaoh’s house. I will take the king of Babylon, and I will set his throne upon these stones that thou hast hid,13 and he shall come and smite the land of Egypt; and I will kindle a fire in the houses [of the gods] of Egypt; and finally he shall array himself with the land of Egypt, as a shepherd arrayeth himself in his garment (43:9–12). This represented the profanation of truth by reasonings from knowledges falsely applied. “The great stones hidden in the brick kiln” signify the truths of the Word falsified by fictions that are"

That he will subject to himself the natural man in respect to all things therein, which is done by confirmations of falsities from knowledges, is signified by “he will array himself with the land of Egypt, as a shepherd arrayeth himself in his garment.” That thus all things of the natural man will be destroyed by the evils of earthly and corporeal loves is signified by “I will kindle a fire in the houses of Egypt.” [10] Because “Egypt” signifies the natural man in respect to knowledge there, and a “furnace of iron” has a similar signification, therefore Egypt in the Word is called “a furnace of iron.” As in Jeremiah: In the day that I brought you14 forth out of Egypt, out of the furnace of iron (11:4). In Moses: He hath brought them15 forth out of the furnace of iron, out of Egypt (Deut. 4:20). In the first book of Kings: Which He brought forth16 out of Egypt, from the midst of the furnace of iron (8:51).

For all freedom of thinking and acting is from the spiritual man, because the spiritual man thinks and wills out of heaven from the Lord, and to be led of the Lord is freedom. From this it can be seen why Egypt is called “a furnace of iron,” and “a house of bondage”; this bondage is signified also by “I removed the shoulder of Israel from the burden of Egypt.” (That “iron” signifies knowledge belonging to the natural man, may be seen above, n. 176.) [11] As most things in the Word have also a contrary sense, so does “oven.” As in Isaiah: Saith Jehovah, who has His hearth in Zion, and His oven in Jerusalem (31:9). “Hearth” signifies the good of love, and “oven” truth from that good, thus the truth of doctrine; “Zion and Jerusalem” have a like signification, “Zion” signifying the church in respect to the good of love, and “Jerusalem” the church in respect to truth of doctrine. “Oven” has a similar meaning in Moses, where it is said: That the meal offering must be prepared either in an oven, or in a plate, or in a frying pan (Lev. 2:4, 5, 7). (This is explained in Arcana Coelestia.) “Furnace” has a similar meaning above in Revelation: The feet of the Son of man were like unto burnished brass, as if glowing in a furnace (1:15)."

This is evident from the signification of “the sun and the air darkened,” as being the light of truth from the Lord being made thick darkness (of which presently) and from the signification of “by the smoke of the pit,” as being by dense falsities from hell, thus by infernal falsities. (That “smoke” signifies dense falsities, and “the pit of the abyss” the hells where and from which are falsities, see above, n. 536–539.) “The sun and the air darkened” signifies that the light of truth from the Lord was made thick darkness, for the Lord in the angelic heaven is a sun, and Divine truth proceeding from the Lord as a sun produces all the light there, and illuminates both the sight and the understanding of angels; when therefore that sun is darkened there, the light of truth, which is from the Lord, is made thick darkness; it is darkened by falsities from hell. All denial of the Divine and of Divine things by those who are merely natural comes from falsities of evil making the light of heaven thick darkness; for such look at Divine things in thick darkness, and therefore they see them as thick darkness, and in consequence deny them. Moreover, the light of heaven when it flows in with those who are in the falsities of evil actually becomes in the spiritual world thick darkness. From this it is that the evil not only do not see or understand spiritual things, that is, the things that belong to heaven and the church, but in heart they deny them. (That the Lord appears in the angelic heaven as a sun, and that Divine truth proceeding from the Lord as a sun produces all the light of heaven, thus all the intelligence and wisdom the angels have, may be seen in the work Heaven and Hell, n. 116–125, and 126–140.) It is said also that the “air” was darkened, meaning the light of truth, for the air gives light from the sun. “Skies” (aetheres) have a similar signification in David: Thy mercy O Jehovah, is in the heavens; and Thy truth is even unto the skies (Ps. 36:5; 57:10; 108:4). “Mercy” signifies the Divine good of Divine love, and “truth” Divine truth; and as Divine truth is the light of heaven, as has just been said, it is said, “Thy truth is even unto the skies”; thus “skies”"

Verse 3. And out of the smoke there went forth locusts upon the earth, signifies that from infernal falsities they became corporeal-sensual in the church. This is evident from the signification of “smoke,” as being infernal falsity (see above, n. 539). Infernal falsity is what is here signified by “smoke,” because it has just been said that this smoke “went up out of the pit of the abyss,” and “the pit of the abyss” signifies the hell where and from which are the falsities of evil that falsify the truths of the Word. The above is evident also from the signification of “locusts,” as being man’s ultimate sensual, which is in the falsity of evil (of which presently); also from the signification of “to go forth upon the earth,” as being upon the church, for the “earth” signifies the church; moreover, the things contained in Revelation are predictions respecting the church and its state. [2] That “locusts” signify man’s ultimate sensual which is in the falsity of evil, can be seen from each and all the particulars related in this chapter to verse 12, in the explanation of which it is shown that “locusts” have no other meaning. But here it shall first be told what is meant by man’s ultimate sensual. It does not mean the sensual of sight, of hearing, of smell, of taste, and of touch, for these things are proper to the body, but the ultimate of thought and affection, which is the first to be opened with infants, and which is such that they think of nothing else and are affected by no other objects than what make one with the senses just named. For infants learn to think by means of the senses, and to be affected by objects that are in accord with the things that are pleasing to the senses; consequently the first internal that is opened with them is the sensual that is called man’s ultimate sensual, or the corporeal- sensual. But afterwards, as the infant grows older and becomes a boy, a more interior sensual is opened, from which he thinks"

Later, in youth and early manhood, a still more interior sensual is opened, from which he thinks rationally, and if he is in the good of charity and faith, he thinks spiritually, and is also affected rationally and spiritually. This thought and affection is what is called the rational and spiritual man, while the former is called the natural man, and the first the sensual man. [3] With every man the interiors that are of his thought and affection are opened successively, and this by a continuous influx out of heaven from the Lord. By this influx the sensual that most nearly adheres to the body is first formed, and from this man becomes sensual; afterwards the natural from which he becomes natural; and after this the rational and with it the spiritual, from which he becomes a rational and spiritual man; but this he becomes only so far as he thinks about God and about the Divine things that are from God, and this is formed and perfected so far as he is affected by these things, that is, so far as he wills and lives according to them. If he does not do this the spiritual man is opened in a general way, but is not formed, still less perfected. By the general opening of his spiritual man, man has the faculty of thinking, and from thought of speaking rationally; this is the general effect of the influx of heaven with every man. This makes clear that man’s thoughts and affections may be spiritual, or natural, or also sensual; and that spiritual thoughts and affections are with those who think from God respecting God and Divine things; while there are only natural thoughts and affections with those who do not think from God respecting God and Divine things, but think only from themselves or from the world respecting themselves or the world. But it should be known that to think from self or from the world is to think not from these but from hell; for whoever does not think from God thinks from hell; no one can think from both at the same time. But those who deny God, and thence the Divine things of heaven and the church, and confirm themselves against these, all become sensual men more or less, according to confirmations; when they are thinking about spiritual things they think falsities only, and are affected by evils; and if they think any truths, whether spiritual, moral, or civil, it is only from the knowledge (scientia) of such things as are in the"

The thought of the sensual man is what is called material thought, and its affection is what is called corporeal affection, which is cupidity. 543b. [4] Furthermore, it is to be known that all the evils that man derives from his parents, which are called hereditary evils, have their seat in his natural and sensual man, but not in the spiritual; consequently the natural man, and especially the sensual man, is the opposite of the spiritual. For the spiritual man from infancy is closed, and is opened and formed only by Divine truths received by the understanding and will; and so far in extent and quality as the spiritual man is opened and formed, the evils of the natural and sensual man are removed, and goods are implanted in place of them. As all evils have their seat in the natural and sensual man it follows that falsities do also, because all falsities are of evil; for when man lusts and wills from evil he thinks and speaks from falsity. For the evil of the will, when it so forms itself in thought that it is manifest to others or to oneself as to its quality, is called falsity; thus falsity is the form of evil, as truth is the form of good. From this it can be seen who and of what quality the man is who is called a sensual man; also that a man becomes sensual when he follows out in act the evils into which he is born, and adds more to them from himself. So far as he does this and confirms himself in these evils, so far the spiritual man is kept closed; and when it is closed the natural and sensual man denies the Divine things that belong to heaven and the church, and acknowledges such things only as belong to the world and nature; and indeed, the sensual man is then so blind as to believe nothing but what he sees with his eyes and touches with his hands. Such are many of the learned, however intelligent and wise they may be thought to be from their ability of speaking from the knowledges that are in the memory, and this apparently as the rational man speaks, since the spiritual mind is opened with them, as it is in every man in a general way, as has been said above."

If sensual things are in the last place, through them a way is opened to the understanding, and truths are disengaged by a kind of extraction, n. 5580.

[6] That the “locust” signifies nothing else but this sensual of man that has now been described can be seen also from other passages in the Word where the locust is mentioned. As in Moses: Moses stretched forth his staff over the land of Egypt, and Jehovah brought along an east wind all the day, and all the night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locust. And the locust went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the border of Egypt, very grievous; before it there was no such locust, nor after it shall there be such. And they covered the surface of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left remaining; so that there remained not any green thing in the tree or in the herb of the field, in all Egypt. And the locust filled the house of Pharaoh, and the house of all his servants, and the house of all the Egyptians (Exod. 10:13–15, 6). All the miracles in Egypt, like all other miracles recorded in the Word, involve and signify spiritual things pertaining to heaven and the church, thus the Egyptian plagues signify spiritual plagues; this plague of the locusts signifies the destruction of the whole natural man by the breaking in of evil and falsity from the sensual; “Egypt” signifies the natural man in respect to knowledge and to what is pleasurable in it, and “the locust” the falsity and evil of the sensual man laying waste the natural man, that is, driving out from it or destroying there all the truth and good of the church; it is therefore said, “and the locust went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all its border,” “the land of Egypt” signifying the natural with the men of the church, and “its border” the sensual with them, for the sensual is the ultimate or most external of the natural, consequently its border; the “locust” means falsity and evil there. Because the falsity and the evil of the sensual man are the most grievous, for they are corporeal and earthly, it is said that the locust was “very grievous, and that before it there was no such locust, nor after it shall there be such”; and this for the reason that the Egyptians had a knowledge of correspondences, and from that a knowledge of the spiritual things which belong to heaven; but these they turned into magic. Because the falsity and the evil of the sensual man, when they break into the natural man, entirely lay it waste by destroying every truth and every good therein, it is said that “the locust covered the whole surface of the earth so that the land was darkened, and did eat every herb of the land,19 and all the"

[7] It is said that here “the locust going up over all the land of Egypt” signifies the breaking in of falsity and evil out of the sensual man into the natural; and yet the natural man is interior and the sensual exterior, and there is no breaking in or influx from the exterior into the interior, but only from the interior into the exterior. It should be known, therefore, that the breaking in or influx of the sensual man into the natural means the blocking up of the natural man until it becomes like the sensual, whereby evil and falsity become more widely extended, and the natural and the sensual become alike corporeal and earthly. In other cases, man learns from infancy to separate the sensual man from the natural, by speaking truth and doing good, even while his thoughts from the sensual man are false, and his will is evil; and this he continues to do until they are entirely separated, which is done when man is reformed and regenerated by the Lord. But if these are not separated man can think and will no otherwise than insanely, and thus speak20 and act insanely. [8] Because the “locust” here signifies the sensual in respect to falsity and evil, or, what is the same, the falsity and evil of the sensual man, the “locust” and the “caterpillar” have the same signification in David: He sent among them a swarm that devoured them, and the frog that destroyed them. He also gave their increase unto the caterpillar, and their labor unto the locust (Ps. 78:45, 46). He spake, and the locust came, and the caterpillar without number, which did eat up every herb in the land, and did eat up the fruit of their land (Ps. 105:34, 35)."

The latter is signified by “caterpillar,” and the former by “locust,” because the caterpillar is also a locust, as is evident from this fact that this was said by David respecting the locusts in Egypt, and yet in Moses the locust only is mentioned, and not the caterpillar. [9] The “locust” and the “caterpillar” have a similar signification in Joel: That which the palmerworm hath left hath the locust eaten; and that which the locust hath left hath the cankerworm eaten; and that which the cankerworm hath left hath the caterpillar eaten. Awake, ye drunkards, and weep; and howl, all ye drinkers of wine, because of the new wine which has been cut off from your mouth (1:4, 5). The floors shall be full of pure grain, and the vats shall overflow with new wine and oil. And I will recompense to you the years that the locust hath eaten, the cankerworm, and the caterpillar, and the palmerworm, My great army which I sent among you (2:24, 25). Evidently these noxious little animals signify falsities and evils devastating or consuming truths and goods with the man of the church, since it is said that “all drinkers of wine should howl because of the new wine which is cut off from your mouth,” “wine” and “new wine” signifying the truth of the church; likewise because it is said that “the floors shall be full of grain, and the presses shall overflow with new wine and oil,” the “floor” signifying the doctrine of the church, “grain” and “oil” its goods, and “new wine” its truths. [10] So in Nahum: The fire shall devour thee; the sword shall cut thee off, it shall devour thee like the caterpillar; make thyself many as the caterpillar; make thyself many as the locust. Thou hast multiplied thy merchants above the stars of the heavens; the caterpillar spreadeth itself abroad and flieth away.

The sensual man falsifies the Word more than others, because the ultimate sense of the Word, which is the sense of its letter, is for the natural and sensual man, while the interior sense is for the spiritual man; consequently when man is not a spiritual man, but is natural and sensual, and is in evil and in falsities therefrom, he does not see the truths and goods in the Word, but applies its ultimate sense to confirm his falsities and evils. “Merchants” signify those who falsify and who communicate and who offer for sale. “Thy crowned are as the locust, and thy commanders as the locust of locusts,” signifies that the primary and chief things of doctrine, that is, “a city of bloods,” are the falsities of evil, and from these again come the falsities of evil; “which sit in the walls in the day of cold” signifies in the truths of the Word that do not appear to be truths, because they have become falsified, and are from evil, “walls” meaning truths that do not appear because they are falsified, and “the day of cold” meaning a state of the love of evil; “the sun ariseth, they fly away, and their place is not known where they are,” signifies that they consume every truth and good, so that there is nothing left. “Multiplying as the locust” has a similar signification in Jeremiah 46:20, 22, 23; also in the book of Judges 6:5; 7:12. [11] The “locust” signifies also falsity in the most external things, or the densest falsity, in Moses: Thou shalt carry out much seed into the field, but shall gather but little; for the locust shall consume it (Deut. 28:38);"

[12] Because the sensual of man is the ultimate and lowest of the life of man’s thought and affection (as has been said above) and because the lowest, when viewed by those who are in a higher or more eminent place, is little, for this reason it is compared to locusts. As in Isaiah: Jehovah who dwelleth above the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof are as locusts (40:22). This signifies that men in respect to intelligence are in things lowest, and the Lord in things highest. [13] In like manner, men viewed by those who are in the persuasion of their superiority over others are compared to locusts, in Moses: The spies of the land of Canaan said, We saw the Nephilim, the sons of Anak which come of the Nephilim; and we were in our own eyes as locusts, and so we were in their eyes (Num. 13:33). The “Nephilim” and the “Anakim” signify in the Word those who are in the strongest persuasion of their being more eminent and wise than others; and in the abstract sense they signify direful persuasions (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 311, 567, 581, 1268, 1270, 1271, 1673, 3686, 7686). That the spies appeared to these and also to themselves like locusts, is in agreement with the appearances in the spiritual world, for there, when those who are in a persuasion of their own superiority look at others, they see them as little and vile, and these then also appear such to themselves.

And as all things, to continue and to subsist, must have a foundation, so the sense of the letter of the Word, which is its ultimate and base, is natural and sensual; and this in a good sense, and, consequently, its truth and good, are meant by the “locust.” This is why John the Baptist ate locusts, and why the sons of Israel were allowed to eat them. Of John the Baptist it is said: That he had his raiment of camel’s hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey (Matt. 3:4; Mark 1:6). John the Baptist was so clothed because like Elijah he represented the Word; and by “his raiment of camel’s hair, and leathern girdle, and eating locusts and wild honey,” he represented the ultimate sense of the Word, which, as was said, is sensual-natural, because it is for the sensual-natural man. “Raiment” signifies truth clothing good; “camel’s hair” the ultimate of the natural man, which is the sensual; the “locusts and wild honey” also signify that ultimate or the sensual as regards appropriation; the “locust” the sensual in respect to truth, “wild honey” the sensual in respect to good, and “eating” appropriation. It is to be known that in ancient times, when the churches were representative churches, all who were in ministries were clothed and also ate according to what they represented. [15] That the sons of Israel were permitted to eat locusts is evident from these words in Moses: Every winged thing that creeps, that walks on four feet, shall be an abomination unto you, but that which walks upon four, which has legs above its feet to leap withal upon the earth, ye shall eat; and among these the locust is mentioned (Lev. 11:20–22). To eat locusts was permitted on account of their having legs above the feet to leap with, because “legs” signify natural good conjoined to spiritual good, and “feet” natural truth from that good; and every truth that is from good ought to be appropri ated and"

Thus in Job: Dost thou give the horse might? Dost thou clothe his neck with shaking? Dost thou make him to leap as a locust? The glory of his nostril is terror (39:19, 20). The understanding is here described by a horse, namely, that like a horse it is mighty, it shakes and curves the neck, and leaps as it goes; and as the ultimate of the understanding is the sensual, and this is signified by the “locust,” and the life of the understanding in this ultimate is signified by “jumping and leaping as it goes,” therefore the horse is said “to leap as a locust.” The most ancient books, among which is Job, were written by pure correspondences; for a knowledge of correspondences was then the knowledge of knowledges; and those writers were held in highest esteem who were able to compose books abounding in the most numerous and significant correspondences. Such is the book of Job; but the spiritual sense therein collected from correspondences does not treat of the holy things of heaven and the church, as the spiritual sense in the Prophets does; consequently that book is not among the books of the Word; but yet passages are quoted from it on account of the correspondences of which it is full. 544.

Just what and of what quality this persuasiveness is which is signified by a “scorpion” scarcely anyone in the world yet knows, because it is the persuasiveness of the spirit of the sensual man, which he has when he becomes a spirit, but does not have while he is living as a man in the world. The reason is that a man in the world rarely speaks out what his spirit thinks and inmostly loves, for he is taught from infancy to utter such things as pertain to civil and moral life, and even such as pertain to the spiritual life, although his spirit, which thinks and wills inwardly, is differently inclined. So long as man’s spirit remains in the body it makes a show of such things before the world, because in no other way can it captivate minds so that his spirit may accomplish the ends it aims at, which are chiefly honors and gain, and name and reputation on account of them. This is why it is unknown in the world just what and of what quality this infatuating and suffocating persuasiveness is that is signified by a “scorpion”; and yet with the spirits in whom it is, it is such as to infuse itself into the mind and disposition of another, and to benumb and almost extinguish his rational and intellectual faculties, making it impossible for him to know otherwise than that what is spoken is truth, although it be most false. Those who are in such persuasiveness do not speak from any reason, but from blind faith without reason, because they speak from the lowest sensual, and in this there is no reason, but only a persuasive faith from such things as ascend from the body and flow in from the world, inspired by the fire of self-love; it is this fire that breathes into, draws out, and pours into another. Consequently those are more especially in this persuasiveness who have imbued themselves with falsities from the love of self, and believe themselves to be wiser than others. This persuasiveness is said to be infatuating because it induces a stupor in the understanding, and is called suffocating because it takes away the free breathing of another; for everyone breathes in harmony with the thought of his mind.

That the Lord delivered the spiritual world from these and like spirits is meant by His “seeing Satan falling from heaven,” and by His giving to those who are in truths from good from Him “authority to tread on serpents and scorpions.” [3] This direful persuasiveness is also signified by “scorpions” in Ezekiel: Son of man, be not afraid of them nor of their words, though the stubborn and thorny be with thee, and thou dwellest among scorpions; be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their faces. They are hard of face, and obdurate in heart (2:6, 4). “To dwell among scorpions” means among those who have persuaded themselves, and strongly persuade others, of falsities, and who do not admit any truth; therefore they are called “stubborn and thorny,” also “hard of face and obdurate in heart.” Moreover, in those who are in a strong persuasion of falsity the interiors which belong to the rational mind are closed up, consequently they think and speak from the lowest sensual only, and when this sensual is enkindled by the fire of self-love it is hard and obdurate, and also hardens and makes obdurate the interiors of others whom it addresses. For in the spiritual world there is a communication of minds, that is, of the thoughts and affections; and from those who are in such persuasiveness there is a pouring in, from which come the effects above mentioned.

From this it can now be known what is meant by these words, that the locusts should “not hurt the grass of the earth, nor any green thing, nor any tree, but those men only that have not the seal of God on their foreheads.” 547. Verse 5. And it was given22 to them that they should not kill them, signifies that they should not be deprived of the faculty of understanding truth and perceiving good. This is evident from the signification of “men,” as being the understanding of truth and the perception of good (see above, n. 546); and from the signification of “killing them,” as being to destroy as regards the spiritual life (of which above, n. 315); but here to deprive of the faculty of understanding truth and perceiving good.

This faculty man never destroys, for if he should destroy it he would be no longer a man but a beast. It appears as if the sensual man who is in the falsities of evil had destroyed it, because he neither understands truth nor perceives good when reading the Word or hearing it from others, but yet he has not destroyed the faculty itself to understand and perceive, but only the understanding of truth and the perception of good, so long as he is in the falsities in which he has confirmed himself from evil; for then he is averse to listen to truth, and this appears like an inability to understand it; but if the persuasion of falsity which obstructs is removed, he then understands and perceives that truth is truth and that good is good, just as a spiritual-rational man does. [2] That this is so it has been given me to know by much experience; for there were many of the infernal crew who had confirmed themselves in falsities against truths and in evils against goods, who thence had become such that they were not willing to hear anything of truth, still less to understand it; and respecting these, therefore, others entertained the opinion that they were unable to understand truth; but the same spirits, when the persuasion of falsity was removed from them, came into the same power and faculty to understand truth as those had who were in the understanding of truth and the perception of good; but immediately upon their falling back into their former state they again appeared to be unable to understand truth, and indeed, were exceedingly indignant at having understood, declaring then that still it was not truth. For it is affection which belongs to the will that makes all the understanding there is with man; from affection is the life itself of the understanding. Consider whether anyone thinks without affection, and whether affection is not the life itself of thought, consequently the life of the understanding. We say an affection and mean the affection that is of love, or love in its continuity. This makes clear that man can indeed destroy the understanding of truth and the perception of good, which is done by means of the falsities of evil; and yet he does not on that account destroy the faculty to understand truth and perceive good; if he did"

For this reason although a man in respect to his two lives, which are the life of his understanding and the life of his will, may have turned away from the Divine, yet by his ability to understand truth and to perceive good he has conjunction with the Divine, and consequently lives to eternity. From this it can now be seen that “it was given to the locusts that they should not kill men” signifies that still they should not be deprived of the faculty to understand truth and perceive good. 548. But that they should torment them five months, signifies that the understanding would be darkened and drawn away by the falsities of evil from seeing truth, so long as they were in that state. This is evident from the signification of “to torment,” as being to have the understanding darkened and withdrawn from seeing truth (of which presently); also from the signification of “five months,” as being so long as they are in that state. “To torment” here signifies to have the understanding darkened and drawn away from seeing truth, because this is said of the locusts and their power to hurt like scorpions, and “locusts” mean the ultimate of man’s life, which is called the sensual, and the power to hurt like scorpions signifies a persuasiveness that can take away from the understanding the light of truth and induce infernal darkness; therefore it now follows that “their torment was as the torment of a scorpion when it striketh a man,” for a “scorpion” signifies such persuasiveness (see above, n. 544). This is said “to torment,” because it is said above that “the locusts should hurt men, but should not kill them”; and that which hurts but does not kill, torments; and the persuasiveness also, which is of the sensual man that is in the falsities of evil, hurts the understanding by darkening it and drawing it away from seeing truth, although it does not deprive it of the faculty to understand and perceive; and because it is compared with the pain from a scorpion “when it striketh a man,” it is said “to torment.” [2] “Five months” signify so long as men are in that state, because a “month” signifies a state, and “five” signifies somewhat, and thus"

This signification of “five months” seems remote, because so long as man lives in the world he is in natural thought, and natural thought derives its ideas from spaces and times and also from numbers and measures; for these are proper to nature, because all things in nature are determined by them; while spiritual thought is without any determinate idea of space, time, number, and measure. For this reason it seems remote and strange to a man in the world, that “five months” should signify so long as that state, that is, a state of the persuasion of falsity continues, for so long the understanding is darkened and drawn away from seeing truth; but when the persuasion of falsity is removed man comes into the faculty to see truth if he wishes to see it, for every man has this faculty. [3] That “five” signifies in the Word somewhat and some, likewise all such, and like things, can be seen from the following passages. In Matthew: Jesus said that the kingdom of heaven is like ten virgins, five of whom were prudent, and five foolish (25:1, 2). The Lord compared the kingdom of the heavens to ten virgins, because “the kingdom of the heavens” signifies the church, as does a “virgin”; and “ten virgins” signify all who are of the church; it is said that “five were prudent and five foolish,” because “five” signifies some of them, or all who are such on the one part. That a “virgin” signifies the church can be seen from many passages in the Word where mention is made of “the virgin of Zion,” “the virgin"

The numbers “ten” and “five” are mentioned by the Lord, because “ten” signifies much, and “five” somewhat; while “their trading” signifies gaining or purchasing heavenly intelligence; and “authority over cities” signifies intelligence and wisdom, for “city” in the Word signifies doctrine, and “to have authority over it” signifies to be intelligent and wise; and “over ten cities” signifies much, and “over five” some.

There was a law given with the sons of Israel: That whoever had stolen an ox, and had either killed it or sold it, should pay back five oxen (Exod. 22:1). Here an “ox” means in the spiritual sense the good of the natural man; “to pay back five oxen for an ox” signifies that one should make sufficient amends for what he had perverted and extinguished; “to steal” means to take away, “to kill” to extinguish, and “to sell” to pervert.

Because “five” signifies all of one part, it was commanded: That over the tabernacle they should make ten curtains, and the five curtains should be coupled together one to another, and the other five curtains should be coupled one to another (Exod. 26:1, 3).

Of the persuasiveness that infatuates and as it were suffocates, of what quality it is and whence it is, has been told above (n. 544). This persuasiveness is said to be infatuating, because it takes away the use of reason, even to the extent that the reason or the rational mind sees nothing except that which is said by the one who has this persuasiveness; for it at once calls up everything that agrees, and obscures everything that disagrees; and in consequence the mind is infatuated by being darkened and drawn away from seeing the truth. This persuasiveness is said to be suffocating because it deprives the understanding of the faculty to think freely and to extend its sight in every direction, as every rational man does, and when this is the case breathing becomes difficult; for everything of voluntary breathing is derived from the understanding, and consequently it adapts itself to the thought of the understanding,"

That a strong persuasiveness has not only the power of infatuating but also of suffocating has been given me to know by real experience. 550. Verse 6. And in those days shall the men seek death, and shall not find it, signifies that they then wish to destroy the faculty to understand truth, but still are not able. This is evident from the signification of “in those days,” as being then, namely, when the man of the church from internal becomes external, or from rational becomes sensual; also from the signification of “to seek death,” as being a wish to destroy the faculty to understand truth (of which presently); also from the signification of “not to find it,” as being not to be able to destroy. That “to seek death” here signifies a wish to destroy the faculty to understand truth, is evident from what precedes, because it is consequent upon it; for it was said that “the locusts should hurt the men only that have not the seal of God on their foreheads,” and afterwards, that “it was given to them that they should not kill them, but that they should torment them,” which signifies that they should do harm to the understanding of truth and the perception of good in those only who are not in truths from good from the Lord, but yet that these should not be deprived of the faculty to understand truth and perceive good (as may be seen above, n. 546, 547).

This, therefore, is what is signified by “they shall seek death and shall not find it.” 551. And they shall long to die, and death shall flee from them, signifies that they wish to destroy the faculty to perceive good, which is of spiritual life, but in vain. This is evident from the signification of “to die,” as being here to destroy the faculty to perceive good (of which presently); also from the signification of “death shall flee from them,” as being that they are unable to destroy, thus that they wish in vain. Here “to die” signifies to destroy the faculty to perceive good, but above “to die” signifies to destroy the faculty to understand truth, because every man has two lives, the life of the understanding, and the life of the will; the life of the understanding is the faculty to understand truth, and the life of the will is the faculty to perceive good; thence “death” means the loss of the one or the other. In the first instance “death” signifies the loss of the faculty to understand truth, and in the second instance the deprivation of the faculty to perceive good, because in what precedes both these lives are treated of, and in the Word, where truth is treated of, good also is treated of, because of the marriage of good and truth in every particular of the Word (on which see above, n. 238, 288b, 484). This makes evident that “death” here signifies the deprivation of the faculty to perceive good. This is why two expressions nearly alike are made use of, and why “to seek death” is predicated of what belongs to the understanding, and “to long for death” of what belongs to the will; and because the spiritual life proper to man consists of these faculties, so their wish to destroy spiritual life is also signified. Moreover, the faculty to perceive good, like the faculty to understand truth, is given to every man, for truth loves good and good loves truth; these, therefore, constantly wish to be conjoined, and they are conjoined like the will and the understanding, or like affection and thought.

Verse 7. And the likenesses of the locusts were like unto horses prepared for battle, signifies that when man has become sensual he reasons as if from the understanding of truth. This is evident from the signification of the “locusts” as being the men of the church who have become sensual through falsities that are from evil (of which above, n. 543); also from the signification of “horses prepared for battle,” as being reasonings, here as if from the understanding of truth, because it is said that they were “like unto” them. (That “horses” signify the understanding, see above, n. 355, 364; and all understanding is of truth.) And because “battle” signifies in the Word spiritual combat, which is a combat of falsity against truth and of truth against falsity, therefore “horses prepared for battle” signify reasonings, here as if from the understanding of truth, for it is by reasonings that spiritual combats are waged. What now follows, even to verse 12, treats of the sensual man who is in falsities from evil, what is his quality in respect to understanding and will; and he is described by “locusts” and their various appearances; for in the spiritual world all man’s affections and thoughts therefrom are represented by various beasts of the earth and by birds, and these are presented to view in such forms as correspond; and the beasts, there represented in accordance with the affections of the spirits from which they are, appear like the beasts in our world, but sometimes with successive change and variety, approaching to forms composed of other beasts, besides also having their heads and bodies clothed and decorated with various insignia. Such have frequently been seen by me; and the qualities of their affections and inclinations were thus made manifest to me.

The sensual man, who is in falsities from evil, reasons as if from an understanding of truth, because he is in the persuasion that falsity is truth and that evil is good; and so long as he is in that persuasion he can see nothing rationally and intellectually; but whatever he has persuaded himself of, he believes to be a matter of the highest reason and most eminent understanding; for the rational and intellectual in him is closed up, and thus he is in a persuasive belief respecting the things he thinks and speaks. That the sensual man reasons acutely and readily, because his thought is so near his speech as to be almost in it, and because he places all intelligence in discoursing merely from the memory, may be seen in Arcana Coelestia (n. 195, 196, 5700, 10236). 553.

This was because kings represented the Lord in relation to Divine truth, and Divine truth combats from Divine good; so this was represented by “a crown of gold,” and wisdom and intelligence itself by the head upon which was the crown.

From this it can be seen that “upon their heads as it were crowns like gold” signifies that those who are sensual men seem to themselves, from the persuasion of the falsity in which they are, to be wise and victorious. [2] As the locusts are described in respect to their heads, their faces, their breasts upon which were breast plates, and as to their tails, and hair, and teeth, it is important to know what their heads signify, and afterwards what the other things signify. The “head” signifies in the Word wisdom and intelligence, because these have their seat in the head; but when those who are in no wisdom or intelligence because they are in falsities from evil are treated of, the “head” signifies folly and insanity, because falsities and evils are therein and therefrom. So here, where those who are sensual and in the persuasion of falsity are treated of, the “head” properly signifies folly and insanity, for such see falsities as truths and evils as goods, for they constantly see what they see from fallacies. Of such, therefore, it is said that “upon their heads were as it were crowns like gold, and their faces as men’s faces,” and other things follow, all of which were appearances from the fantasy with them, therefore it is said “as it were” crowns, and “like” gold, which shows that these appearances were not real but fallacious. For in the heavens all appearances that exist are real, because they are correspondences; for the interiors belonging to the affections and thoughts therefrom of the angels, when they pass to the sight of their eyes, are clothed in such forms as are manifest in the heavens; they are called appearances because they are visible, and they are said to be correspondences and are real because they spring from creation. But it is otherwise with the appearances in some of the hells, where those are who are in the persuasions of falsity from evil; from these persuasions fantastic visions spring, in which there is inwardly nothing real, and for this reason they also vanish if a single ray from the light of heaven flows in. Such are the appearances that are here described in reference to the “locusts.” (But of appearances in the spiritual world, both those that are real and those that are not real, see in the work Heaven and Hell, n. 170–176; and above, in the explanation, n. 369, 395a.)"

Sensual men appear thus to themselves because sensual men persuade themselves that they are more in truths from good than others are, although they are in falsities from evil; for they are unable to look inwardly from heaven at anything, but only outwardly from the world; those who see from the world alone see only from a delusive light, from which they suppose themselves to be more intelligent and wiser than others, not knowing what intelligence and wisdom are, or what they are from. From this persuasive faith is their belief that they are in the spiritual affection of truth; this therefore is signified by “the faces of the locusts seemed to be as men’s faces.” [3] But this must be illustrated by experience in the spiritual world. All who are in the heavens are men in respect both to the face and to the rest of the body, for they are in the spiritual affection of truth, and the spiritual affection of truth is itself a man in form, because that affection is from the Lord, who alone is Man, and because from Him the universal heaven conspires to the human form; consequently angels are forms of their affections, and"

That among themselves they appear with a face like men is from fantasy and consequent persuasion. (But respecting these appearances see also in the work Heaven and Hell, n. 553.) 555a. Verse 8. And they had hair as the hair of women, signifies that they seem to themselves to be also natural affections of truth. This is evident from the signification of “hair,” as being the things of the natural man, and in particular the true knowledges there (of which above, n. 66); and from the signification of “women,” as being affections (of which presently). “Hair” signifies the things of the natural man because the “head” signifies the things of the spiritual man, and all things of the natural man invest all things of the spiritual man, as the hair invests the head; the head also corresponds to things spiritual, and the hair to things natural, thence also that is what they signify. It is from this correspondence that angels are seen with beautiful hair, and from the orderly arrangement, grace, and gloss of their locks it may be known how the natural man in them corresponds with the spiritual. Now as “women” signify affections, it can be seen that “they had hair as the hair of women” signifies that they seem to themselves to be natural affections of truth. That this is what is signified is evident also from the series; for “faces as men’s faces” signify the appearance as if they were spiritual affections of truth; thence now it follows that “hair as the hair of women” signifies there seeming to be natural affection of truth; it is said immediately, too, of their teeth, that they were “as lion’s teeth,” and these signify the ultimates of the natural man in respect to knowledge and power.

It is very evident that a woman, a daughter, or a virgin is not meant, since where these are mentioned the church is treated of; but what they signify can be seen from the connection of the subjects treated of in the spiritual sense. [2] That “woman” signifies the church as regards the affection of truth, thus the affection of the truth of the church, can be seen from the following passages in the Word. In Jeremiah: Wherefore commit ye evil against your souls, to cut off from you man and woman, babe, and suckling, out of Jerusalem?24 (44:7). I will scatter man and woman; I will scatter the old man and the lad; I will scatter the young man and the virgin (51:22). In Ezekiel: Slay to destruction the old man and the young man and the virgin and the infant and the women (9:6). In Lamentations: They ravished the women in Zion, the virgins in the cities of Judah; princes were hanged up by their hand; the faces of elders were not honored (5:11, 12). In these passages “man and woman,” “old man and babe,” “youth and virgin,” do not mean man, woman, old man, babe, youth, and virgin, but all things of the church; “man and woman” signify truth and its affection, “old man and babe” wisdom and innocence, “youth and virgin” the understanding of truth and the affection for good. That such is the signification is made evident from this that these chapters treat of the church and its desolation in respect to truth and good; therefore these terms signify such things as belong to the church. For the Word is inwardly spiritual, because it is Divine; but if man and woman, old man and babe, youth and virgin meant such persons, the Word would not be spiritual but natural; but it becomes spiritual when “man and woman” mean the church in respect to truth and its affection, “old man and babe” the"

Moreover, man is man because the church is in him, and where the church is, there is heaven. When, therefore, man as “old,” “young,” an “infant,” a “male,” also “woman” and “virgin” are mentioned, that with them pertaining to the church that corresponds in age, sex, inclination, affection, intelligence, and wisdom, is meant. [3] That “woman” signifies the church in respect to the affection of truth, or the affection of the truth of the church, can be seen also from these words in Isaiah: Then seven women shall take hold of one man in that day, saying, We will eat our own bread, and we will clothe ourselves with our own raiment; only let thy name be called upon us; gather thou up our reproach (4:1). This treats of the end of the church, when there is no longer any truth, for these words precede: Thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy strength in the war (3:25); which signify that the understanding of truth will be destroyed by falsities, so that there will be no more resistance in combats; and it is added: In that day shall the shoot of Jehovah be for splendor and glory (4:2); which signifies that truth will spring up anew in the church; for this is said of the Lord’s coming. “Seven women shall take hold of one man” signifies that truth will be desired and sought from affection but will not be found; “man” signifying truth, “women” affections or longings for truth, and “seven” holiness. That instruction in genuine truths, and thus spiritual nourishment would not be found, is signified by saying “we will eat our own bread, and we will clothe ourselves with our own raiment”; “bread” signifying instruction and spiritual nourishment, and “raiment” truth clothing good; that truth only can be applied and by"

How long wilt thou go about? For Jehovah hath created a new thing in the earth; a woman shall compass a man (31:21, 22). This treats of the spiritual captivity in which the church was before the Lord’s coming. The church is said to be in spiritual captivity when there is no truth, and yet truth is desired; in such captivity were the Gentiles with whom the church was established. “Return, O virgin of Israel, return to thy cities,” signifies that they shall return to the truths of doctrine; “virgin of Israel” being the church, and “her cities” the truths of doctrine. “For Jehovah hath created a new thing in the earth, a woman shall compass a man,” signifies that a new church is to be established in which truth will be conjoined to its affection; “to create a new thing in the earth” meaning to establish that new thing; “woman” being the church in respect to the affection of truth, “man” truth, and “to compass” to be conjoined. [5] In Isaiah: As a woman forsaken and afflicted in spirit Jehovah hath called thee, and a woman of youth when rejected, said thy God. For a small moment have I forsaken thee; but with great compassions will I gather thee (54:6, 7). Here, too, “a woman forsaken and afflicted in spirit” means the church that is not in truths and yet is in the affection or longing for them, “woman” meaning the church, which is said to be “forsaken” when it is not in truths, and to be “afflicted in spirit” when in grief from the affection or longing for truths. “A woman of youth” means the ancient church, which was in truths from affection; and “one rejected” means the Jewish church, which was not in truths from any spiritual affection; that the church is to be established by"

For death hath come up through the windows, it hath come into our palaces, to cut off the babe from the street, the young man from the broad ways (9:20, 21). It was said to women that they should hear and perceive, because “women” signify the church from the affection and reception of truth; “sons whom the women should teach wailing,” and the “companion whom a woman should teach lamentation,” signify all who are of the church, “sons” signifying those who are in the truths of the church, “companion” they who are in the good of the church; “wailing and lamentation” signify because of the church vastated in respect to truths and goods; “death hath come up through the windows, it hath come into our palaces” signifies infernal falsity entering into the understanding, and thence into all things of thought and affection, “windows” signifying the understanding, and “palaces” all things of the thought and affection; “to cut off the babe from the street, and the young man from the broad ways,” signifies the vastation of nascent truth and of truth born; the “babe in the street” meaning nascent truth, and “the young man in the broad ways” truth born.

[8] In Micah: Ye draw off the robe from them that pass by securely, returning from war. The women of my people ye drive out from the house of their delights (2:8, 9). “To draw off the robe from them that pass by securely, returning from war,” signifies to deprive of truths all who are in truths, and who have fought against falsities; “who pass by securely” signifies all who are in truths; “returning from war” those who have been in temptations, and who have fought against falsities. “To drive out the women of my people from the house of their delights” signifies to destroy the affections of truth, and thus the pleasantnesses and felicities of heaven, “the women of my people” meaning the affections of truth, and “house of delights” the pleasantnesses and felicities of heaven, for these are the affections of good and truth.

What “David” and his house, likewise what “Levi,” and “Simeon,” and their houses signify, has been shown in the explanations above, namely, that “David” signifies Divine truth, “Nathan” the doctrine of truth, “Levi” the good of charity, and “Simeon” truth and good in respect to perception and obedience. It is said “the families shall lament apart, and their women apart,” because “families” signify the truths of the church, and “women” the affections of truth; and these “lament apart” when truth laments because there is no affection of it, and affection laments because it has no truth. This is said of the lamentation over each and all things of the church because they are vastated and destroyed; for each and all things of the church are signified by “all the families that are left,” which mean the tribes. That “the twelve tribes” signify all things of the church in the complex may be seen above (n. 430a, b, 431). “Jerusalem” signifies the church and its doctrine.

[12] In Moses: I will break for you the staff of bread, that ten women may bake your bread in one oven, and they shall bring back your bread by weight; and ye shall eat and not be satisfied (Lev. 26:26). This means, in the spiritual sense, that truth from good, which is spiritual nourishment, shall fail, “bread” signifying all spiritual food by which the man of the church is nourished, and “women” those of the church who are in the affection of truth. “Ten women shall bake bread in one oven” signifies that the truth which may be conjoined to good will be sought for but very little will be found; for “to bake” signifies to prepare and conjoin that it may serve for the use of life; “to bring back the bread by weight” signifies that it is scarce; and “to eat and not be satisfied” signifies because truth from good is so scanty and scarce as to yield hardly any nourishment to the soul. [13] In Moses: A man’s garment shall not be upon a woman, neither shall a man put on a woman’s garment; for whosoever doeth these things is an abomination unto Jehovah thy God (Deut. 22:5). “Man and his garment” signifies truth, and “woman and her garment” signifies the affection of truth. These in every man are as distinct as understanding and will are, or as thought which is of the understanding, and affection which is of the will are; and unless they were distinct, the sexes would be confounded, and there would be no marriage, for in marriage man is the truth which is of the thought, and woman is affection."

That man and woman were both so created that they may be two and yet one, is evident from the book of Genesis in which it is said of the creation of the two: And God created man in His own image, in the image of God created He him;27 male and female created He them (Gen. 1:27; 5:2). [14] And afterwards: The man said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh; for this she shall be called wife, because she was taken out of man. Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife; and they shall be one flesh (Gen. 2:23, 24; Mark 10:6–9). Man here means the church in general and in particular. The church in particular is the man of the church, or the man in whom the church is. “God created man in His own image” signifies in the image of heaven; for “God,” that is, Elohim, in the plural, signifies the Divine proceeding that makes heaven, and the man who is a church is a heaven in the least form, for he corresponds to all things of heaven (see in the work Heaven and Hell, n. 7–12, 51–58). “Male” signifies here, as above, the truth which is of the understanding, and “female” the good which is of the will; the wife is said to be “bone of man’s bones, and flesh of his flesh,” to signify that good, which is the wife, is from truth, which is the man, “bone” signifying truth before it is vivified, that is, conjoined to good, such as is the truth of the memory with man; and because all good is formed from truths it is said, “because she was taken out of man.” That “the man shall leave his father and mother and shall cleave unto his wife” signifies that truth must be of good, and that thus both must become one good; this is signified by “they shall be one flesh,” “flesh” signifying good, and also a human being. But the things here said cannot enter the understanding of man, except with few, unless it is known that the first two chapters of Genesis treat of the new creation, that is, of the regeneration of the men of the church, the first chapter of their regeneration, the second of their intelligence and wisdom; and “male and female,” or “man and wife,” mean in the spiritual sense the conjunction of truth and good, which is called the heavenly marriage, into which marriage man comes when he is regenerated and becomes a church; and man"

These things were commanded because a “woman not conjoined to a man” signified the church in respect to the affection for truth or for conjunction with truth; but “a woman conjoined to a man of Midian” signified good adulterated; for the Midianites represented, and thence signified, truth that is not truth because it is not from good, thus is falsity. This was why the women who had known man were to be killed, but those who had not known man were to be kept alive. “The women of Midian” signified the defilement of good by falsities, and thus good adulterated and profaned, which is filthy adultery, as is evident from what is related respecting “the whoredom of the sons of Israel with the women of the Midianites” (Num. 25). [16] Whoever does not know that “woman” signifies the spiritual affection of truth, also that the evils and falsities that everyone has are in the natural man, and none of them in the spiritual man, cannot know what is signified by the following respecting a woman captive in Moses: If thou shalt see in captivity a woman beautiful in form of the enemy, and hast a desire unto her for a wife, thou shalt bring her into the midst of thy house; where she shall shave her head and pare her nails; then she shall put away the raiment of her captivity from off her,"

And because his speech takes its tone from these, it fascinates and infatuates the minds of others, for the tone of confidence and belief produces such an effect; and this is especially manifest in the spiritual world, where man speaks from his spirit; for the affection of self-confidence and of the consequent belief that a thing is so is in man’s spirit, and a man’s spirit speaks from his affection. In the natural world it is different. There man’s spirit discourses by means of the body, and for the sake of the world brings forth such things as are not of the affection of his spirit, which he rarely exhibits, that its character may not be known. For this reason it is unknown in the world that there is such an infatuating and suffocating persuasiveness as exists in the spirit of the sensual man, who believes himself to be wiser than others. From this it can be seen why “their teeth were as those of lions” signifies that sensual men seem to themselves to have understanding, and thereby power over all things. That “teeth” signify sensual things, which are the ultimates of the natural life in respect to knowledge can be seen from the correspondence of “teeth,” as described in the work Heaven and Hell (n. 575), and in Arcana Coelestia (n. 5565–5568)."

In David: My soul, I lie in the midst of lions; their teeth are spear and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword (Ps. 57:4). “Lions” signify those who by means of falsities destroy the truths of the church; “their teeth which are spear and arrows” signify the knowledges that are applied to confirm falsities and evils, and thus to destroy the truths and goods of the church; “their tongue a sharp sword” signifies crafty reasonings from falsities, which are called “a sharp sword” because a “sword” signifies falsity destroying truth. [3] In the same: O God, break off their teeth in their mouth; remove30 the jaw teeth of the young lions (Ps. 58:6). “Teeth in their mouth” signify the knowledges from which they produce falsities; “the jaw teeth of the young lions,” signify the truths of the Word falsified, which in themselves are falsities, and which are especially effective in destroying the truths of the church. [4] In Joel: A nation cometh up upon my land, vigorous and without number; its teeth are the teeth of a lion, and it hath the jaw teeth of an immense lion. It maketh31 my vine to a waste, and my fig tree to froth (1:6, 7). “A nation that cometh up upon the land” signifies evil devastating the church, “nation” meaning evil, and “land” the church; “vigorous and without number” signifies powerful and manifold; “vigorous” is predicated of the power of evil, and “without number” of the power of falsity; “its teeth are the teeth of a lion” signifying destroying falsities; “the jaw teeth of an immense lion” signify truths falsified; “it reduceth the vine to a waste, and the fig tree to froth,” signifies the destruction of spiritual and natural truths; spiritual truths are those of the spiritual sense of the Word, and natural truths those of the sense of its letter (see also above, n. 403b, where this is explained).

[5] In Daniel: There came up out of the sea a second beast like to a bear; three ribs were in its mouth between its teeth; and they said unto it, Arise, devour much flesh. After this there came up a fourth beast, dreadful, and terrible, and exceedingly strong, and it had great teeth of iron; it devoured and crushed, and trampled the remnant with its feet (Dan. 7:5, 7). “A beast from the sea” means the love of dominion, to which holy things serve as means, and the “four beasts” signify its successive increase; this “second beast like to a bear” signifies the second state, when such dominion is confirmed by means of the Word; those who do this appear in the spiritual world like bears. “Three ribs in the mouth between the teeth” signify all things of the Word which they apply, and which they understand merely according to the letter, “three ribs” meaning all things of the Word, “in the mouth” meaning, which they apply in teaching; “between the teeth” meaning which they under stand merely according to the letter, that is, as the sensual man does; “they said unto it, Arise, devour much flesh,” signifies that they applied many things and thereby destroyed the genuine sense of the Word; “the fourth beast that came up out of the sea, dreadful, and terrible, and exceedingly strong,” signifies the fourth and last state, when by holy things as means they established for themselves dominion over heaven and earth; because this state is profane and powerful it is called “dreadful, and terrible, and exceedingly strong”; “it had great teeth of iron” signifies falsities from the sensual man hard against the truths and goods of the church; “it devoured and crushed” signifies that it perverted and destroyed; “and trampled the remnant with its feet” signifies that what they could not pervert and destroy they defiled and blotted out by the evils of natural and corporeal loves.

This evil, among others, was denounced upon the Israelitish and Jewish people if they did not keep and do the statutes and commandments; “the tooth of beasts” signifies falsities from evils of every kind, and “the poison of the creeping things of the earth” signifies the things that destroy and utterly extinguish spiritual life; “beasts” signify in the Word such things as belong to the natural man, and “the creeping things of the earth” the things belonging to the sensual man; both these when separated from the spiritual man are mere falsities from evils, because they are merely such things as belong to the body to which they adhere, and as belong to the world to which they stand nearest; and from the body and the world all thick darkness in spiritual things arises. [7] In David: Arise, O Jehovah; save me, O my God; for Thou smitest all mine enemies upon the cheek; Thou breakest the teeth of the wicked (Ps. 3:7). “To smite the enemies upon the cheek” signifies to destroy interior falsities with those who are opposed to the goods and truths of the church; such persons and their falsities of evil are meant in the Word by “enemies”; “to break the teeth of the wicked” signifies to destroy exterior falsities, which are such as are based on the fallacies of the senses and are confirmed by them. 556b.

That these words are not to be understood according to the letter is evident to everyone; for who is bound by Christian love to turn the left cheek to him who smites the right, or to give the cloak to him who would take away the coat? In a word, who is there to whom it is not allowable to resist evil? But as all things that the Lord said were in themselves Divine-celestial, it can be seen that these words, as well as the others which the Lord spoke, contain a heavenly sense. The sons of Israel had this law that they should give “an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth” (Exod. 21:23, 24; Lev. 24:20; Deut. 19:21), because they were external men, and thus were only in the representatives of heavenly things, and not in heavenly things themselves, thence not in charity, in mercy, in patience, nor in any spiritual good; consequently they were under the law of retaliation; for the heavenly law and thence the Christian law is that which the Lord taught in the Gospels: All things whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, even so do ye to them; this is the Law and the Prophets (Matt. 7:12; Luke 6:31). Because this is the law in heaven, and from heaven in the church, therefore every evil carries with it a corresponding punishment, which is called the punishment of evil, and is in the evil as if joined with it; and from this springs the punishment of retaliation which was prescribed for the sons of Israel, because they were external and not internal men. Internal men, as the angels of heaven are, do not wish the retaliation of evil for evil, but from heavenly charity they forgive freely; for they know that the Lord protects from the evil all who are in good, and that He protects according to the good with them, and that He would not protect if on account of the evil done to them they should burn with enmity, hatred, and revenge, for these drive away protection. [9] These things, therefore, are involved in what the Lord here said; but their signification shall be given in order: “An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth,” signifies that so far as anyone takes away from another the understanding of truth and the sense of"

That one who is in Christian good will permit an evil person to take these away as far as he can, is described by what the Lord says in reply on the same subject. “Resist not him that is in evil” signifies that there should be no fighting back of retaliation; for angels do not fight with the evil, much less do they return evil for evil, but they allow it to be done, since they are protected by the Lord, and therefore no evil from hell can do them harm. “Whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek turn to him the other also” signifies if anyone wishes to do harm to the perception and understanding of interior truth, it may be allowed to the extent of the effort; “the cheek” signifies the perception and understanding of interior truth, the “right cheek” affection for it and consequent perception of it, and the “left cheek” understanding of it, and as the “cheek” is mentioned, so is “smiting,” which means doing harm to; for all things pertaining to the mouth, as the throat, the mouth itself, the lips, the cheeks, the teeth, signify such things as belong to the perception and understanding of truth, because they correspond to them, therefore by these objects in the sense of the letter of the Word, which consists of pure correspondences, these things are expressed; “if any man wisheth to sue thee at the law and to take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also,” signifies if anyone wishes to take away truth interiorly with thee, it may be allowed him to take away also exterior truth, “coat” signifying interior truth, and “cloak” exterior truth. This also is what angels do when they are with the evil, for the evil can take away nothing of good and truth from angels, but they can from those who on that account burn with enmity, hatred, and revenge, for these evils avert and repel protection by the Lord; “whosoever shall compel thee to go one mile, go with him two,” signifies whoever wishes to lead away from truth to falsity and from good to evil, since he cannot do it, may be left unopposed, a “mile” having a similar signification as a “way,” namely, that which leads away or leads; “give to everyone that asketh thee” signifies that it is to be permitted; “and from him that wisheth to borrow of thee turn thou not away” signifies that if anyone wishes to be instructed"

This is the spiritual sense of these words, in which are stored up the hidden things that have now been said, which are especially for the angels; who perceive the Word only according to its spiritual sense; they are also for men in the world who are in good, when the evil are trying to lead them astray. That the opposition of the evil to those whom the Lord protects is such it has been granted me to know by much experience; for they have continually striven in every way and with all their might to take away from me truths and goods, but in vain. From what has been presented it can also in some degree be seen that a “tooth” signifies truth or falsity in the sensual, which is the ultimate of the intellectual life with man; that this is the signification of “tooth” is evident from the Lord’s reply, in which the perception and understanding of truth are treated of, which the evil strive to take away from the good. 556c. [10] That this is the signification of “teeth” can be seen further from the following passages. In Jeremiah: In those days they shall say no more, The fathers have eaten a sour grape, and the teeth of the sons are set on edge. But every man shall die in his own iniquity; every man that eateth the sour grape, his teeth shall be set on edge (31:29, 30; Ezek. 18:2–4). This involves evidently that the sons and descendants shall not incur punishment on account of the evils of parents, but everyone on account of his own evil; “to eat the sour grape” signifies to appropriate to oneself the falsity of evil, for a “sour grape,” which is a bitter and bad grape, signifies the falsity of evil, and “to eat” signifies to appropriate to oneself; and “the teeth set on edge” signifies to be in the falsity of evil therefrom, for “teeth” here as above signify falsities in ultimates or in the sensual man, in which the evils of parents, which are called hereditary evils, especially lie hidden in children, and “to be set on edge” signifies the appropriation of falsity from evil; for a man is not punished on account of hereditary evils but on account of his own and so far as he makes hereditary evils actual in himself; therefore it is said that “everyone shall die in his own iniquity; and every man that eateth the sour grape, his teeth shall be set on edge.”"

[12] In Amos: I have given to you emptiness of teeth in all your cities, and want of bread in all your places (4:6). “Emptiness of teeth in the cities” stands for a scarcity of truth in doctrines, and “want of bread in all places” for scarcity of good from doctrines in the life. [13] In Zechariah: I will take away his bloods out of his mouth, and his abominations from between his teeth (9:7). This is said of Tyre and Sidon, which signify the knowledges of truth and good, here these falsified; “bloods out of the mouth” signify the falsifications of the knowledges of truths; and “the abominations from between the teeth” signify the adulterations of the knowledges of good; the knowledges of good are also truths, for to know goods is from the understanding, and the understanding is of truth.

[15] In Job: I brake the jaw teeth of the wicked, and plucked the prey out of his teeth (29:17).

And Jesus said unto him, Thou dumb and deaf spirit, I command thee come out of him, and enter no more into him (9:17, 18, 25). One who is ignorant of the spiritual sense of the Word might suppose that they are said “to gnash the teeth” merely because they were angry and intent on evil, since men then press the teeth together; but they are said “to gnash the teeth” because the endeavor to destroy and the act of destroying truths by means of falsities are meant by it; this is said in the Word because “teeth” signify falsities in things most external, and “gnashing” signifies vehemence in fighting for them; this effort and act are also from correspondence. [17] Moreover, such was the deaf and dumb spirit that the Lord cast out; for all spirits are from the human race; this spirit was from that kind of men who had vehemently fought for falsities against truths; consequently the one obsessed by him “foamed and gnashed his teeth.” He is called by the Lord “deaf and dumb” because he was unwilling to perceive and understand the truth, for such are signified by “the deaf and the dumb.” And because this spirit was determined and obstinate against truths, and had confirmed himself in falsities, the disciples were not able to cast him out, for the falsities for which he had fought they were not yet able to dispel because they had not yet reached the proper state, and it was for this also that the disciples were rebuked by the Lord.

These disputations and contests are heard outside of these hells as gnashings of teeth, and are also turned into gnashings of teeth when truths flow in thither out of heaven. (But more on this subject may be seen in the work Heaven and Hell, n. 575.) [19] Because with the evil the teeth correspond to the falsities they have in the ultimates of their intellectual life, which are called corporeal-sensual, therefore the spirits who are such appear deformed in the face, the greater part of which is made up of the teeth standing widely apart like gratings, and in a broad grin, and this because such gaping of teeth corresponds to the love and eagerness for fighting for falsities against truths. [20] Because the teeth correspond to the ultimates of man’s intellectual life, which are called sensual, and these when separated from the truths of the interior understanding, which are called spiritual, are in the falsities of evil, but the same when not separated correspond to the truths of good in the sensual, so “teeth” in the Word signify also ultimate truths (as in Job 19:19, 20; Amos 4:6, which may be seen explained above). [21] And because the Lord glorified His entire Human, that is, made it Divine, therefore it is said of Him in Moses: His eyes shall be red with wine, and His teeth white with milk (Gen. 49:12). “Eyes red with wine” signifies that His intellectual was Divine truth from Divine good; and “teeth white with milk” signifies that His"

Verse 9. And they had breastplates as iron breastplates, signifies the persuasions with which they gird themselves for combats, against which the truths of the rational-spiritual man prevail not. This is evident from the signification of “breastplates” (or coats of mail), as being defenses against evils and falsities in combats, but here defenses of evils and falsities against goods and truths, because this treats of those who are in the falsities of evil in opposition to truths. Here “breastplates” signify persuasions, because sensual men who are in the falsities of evil, who are here described, do not fight against truths from reason, for they do not see truths, but falsities only, and are therefore in the persuasion that falsities are truths, consequently they fight solely from the persuasion of falsity, and with them this persuasion is such that the truths brought forth by the spiritual-rational man are of no avail, for they are repelled as a sword is from a breastplate or coat of mail. So “breastplates as iron breastplates” signify persuasions against which truths are of no avail. That the persuasiveness with such is so infatuating and suffocating that the spiritual-rational is of no avail against it may be seen above (n. 544, 549, 556a). Moreover, breastplates or coats of mail cover that part of the body called the breast or thorax, and this signifies the spiritual affection of truth; also all affection is contained in the sound which comes forth from the breast with the speech. But those who are here signified by “locusts,” who are such sensual men as are in falsities, have no other affection than that of the love of self, and because that affection is full of self-confidence and full of the persuasion that their falsity is truth, and because that affection is in the sound which comes forth from the breast with"

Because the persuasion of sensual men who are in falsities from self-confidence is such, and with spirits is so powerful that it suffocates and extinguishes the rational of other spirits with whom they converse in the world of spirits, it is severely prohibited, and those who make use of it are sent among spirits where they are distressed even to swooning by other spirits by means of still stronger persuasions, and this until they desist. [2] Because breastplates or coats of mail were in use in wars, and to put them on signified to gird oneself for war and thus to fight, therefore in the Word those who were girt for fighting are said to have put on coats of mail. Thus in Jeremiah: Harness the horses, and go up, ye horsemen; and stand ye forth in helmets; furbish the spears, and put on the coats of mail (46:4). These words do not mean the combat of one army against another, but the combat of the spiritual-rational man against the natural man who, from knowledges falsely applied, fights against truths and goods. For this is said of the army of Pharaoh king of Egypt, whom the king of Babylon smote, and “Pharaoh king of Egypt” means such a natural man, and “the king of Babylon,” near the Euphrates, means the spiritual-rational man, therefore “Harness the horses, go up, ye horsemen, and stand ye forth in helmets; furbish the spears, and put on the coats of mail,” signifies such things as relate to the combat of the spiritual-rational man against the natural man who is in falsities; “horses” mean the things of the understanding, “chariots to which they were harnessed” the things of doctrine, “horsemen” the intelligent, “helmets” the things of reason, “spears” truths combating, and “coats of mail” force and strength in fighting and resisting. A “coat of mail” has this meaning because it girds the breast, and from the breast through the arms is all the strength in fighting and resisting."

This is evident from the signification of “tails,” as meaning sensual knowledges (of which presently); and from the signification of “scorpions,” as being an infatuating and suffocating persuasiveness (of which see above, n. 544); therefore “tails like scorpions” signify sensual knowledges which are persuasive. “Tails” signify sensual knowledges because the tails that protrude outwardly from animals of the earth are the continuations of the spinal cord, which is called the spinal marrow, and this is a continuation of the brain, and the “brain” in like manner as the “head,” signifies intelligence and wisdom, because intelligence and wisdom in their beginnings have their seat there; and as tails are the ultimates of the brain they signify sensual knowledges, since these are the ultimates of intelligence and wisdom.

For example, men who are learned in this kind of knowledge, who are skilled in physics, anatomy, botany, and other branches of human learning, when they see the wonderful things in the animal and vegetable kingdoms say in their hearts that all these things are from nature, and not from the Divine, and this because they believe in nothing that they do not see with their eyes and touch with their hands; for they are unable to elevate their minds upward so as to see these things from the light of heaven, for that light is thick darkness to them; but they detain their minds in earthly things, much the same as the animals of the earth do, with which indeed they compare themselves. In a word, with such all knowledges (scientiae) are made sensual; for such as the man himself is, such are all things of his understanding and will; if the man is spiritual all things become spiritual; if he is merely natural all things become natural and not spiritual; if the man is sensual all things become sensual, and this however learned and erudite he may seem to the world to be. But as every man has the faculty to understand truths and perceive goods, such men are able from that faculty to talk about these things like those who are spiritual- rational, although in respect to their spirit they are sensual; for when such men speak before others they do not speak from the spirit but from the bodily memory. [3] All this has been said to make known what sensual knowledges are. These are what especially persuade, or are especially persuasive, because they are the ultimates of the understanding; for into these as into its ultimates the understanding closes, and these captivate the common people because they are appearances drawn from such things as they see in the world with their eyes; and so long as the thought clings to these it is impossible to dispose the mind to think interiorly or above"

For this reason spiritual men rarely think from things sensual, for they think from things rational and intellectual; but sensual men, who have confirmed themselves in falsities against Divine and spiritual things, when they are left to themselves think only from sensual things. [4] That “tails” signify sensual knowledges can be seen from the following passages. In Isaiah: Jehovah will cut off from Israel head and tail, branch and rush. The old man and the honorable, he is the head; but the prophet, the teacher of lies, he is the tail (9:14, 15). This means that all intelligence and wisdom and all knowledge (scientia) of truth will perish; the “head” signifies intelligence and wisdom, wherefore it is said “the old man and the honorable, he is the head,” for the “old man” signifies the understanding of truth, and the “honorable” the wisdom of good; but the “tail” signifies sensual knowledge (scientificum), which is the ultimate of intelligence and wisdom; when this is not joined to spiritual intelligence it becomes false knowledge, or knowledge applied to confirm falsities, which is sensual knowledge, like that of the sensual man who sees nothing from the understanding. This is why “the prophet who teacheth lies” is called the “tail,” a “prophet” signifying the doctrine of truth, and thence the knowledge of truth, but here doctrine and the knowledge of falsity, for a “lie” signifies falsity, and the “teacher of a lie” one who teaches falsity by applying knowledges from the sense of the letter of the Word to confirm falsities.

For man’s interiors which belong to his thought and affection are elevated to heaven by the Lord when man is in the good of life and thence in the truths of doctrine; but when he is in the evil of life and thence in falsities, his lower things look downward, thus only to his body and to such things as are in the world, and thus to hell. Thus man puts off his truly human nature and puts on a beastly nature, for beasts look downward and to such things only as are met with in the world and upon the earth. Elevation into the light of heaven by the Lord is an actual elevation of man’s interiors to the Lord; and a depression or casting down to such things as are below and outside the eyes is an actual depression and casting down of the interiors, and when this takes place, all the thought of the spirit is immersed in the ultimate sensual."

This must have a like meaning; “to be as the head” signifying to be spiritual and intelligent, and “to be as the tail” to be sensual and stupid; therefore it is added “he shall lend to thee, and thou shalt not lend to him,” which signifies that he shall teach thee truths, but thou shalt not teach him. [8] In Isaiah: Say unto him, Take heed, and be quiet; fear not, neither let thine heart be soft because of the two tails of smoking firebrands, for the glowing anger of Rezin and Syria, and of the son of Remaliah (7:4). “Rezin and Syria” signify the perverted rational, and “the son of Remaliah,” king of Israel, who is also called “Ephraim,” signifies the perverted intellectual; it is the intellectual in respect to the Word that is signified by “the king of Israel” and “Ephraim”; and it is the rational in respect to the knowledges (scientiae) that confirm that is signified by “Rezin and Syria,” for a man in order to have an understanding of the Word must have a rational, and when these two are perverted they look only downward to the earth, and outward to the world, as sensual men do who are in the falsities of evil; therefore they are called “tails.” A “smoking firebrand” signifies the lust of falsity and consequent wrath against the truths and goods of the church.

Because “tails” signify sensual knowledges, and when these knowledges are separated from things interior which are spiritual, and in consequence do not with things interior look inward and upward but look outward and downward, they signify falsities confirmed by knowledges. Therefore also in what follows in Revelation, where falsities from that origin are treated of, it is said: That the tails of the horses seen in vision were like unto serpents, and that they had heads with which they did hurt (9:19). And afterwards: That the dragon with his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and cast them to the earth (Rev. 12:3, 4); which things may be seen explained below. 560.

This is evident from the signification of “stings,” as being craftiness and shrewdness in persuading as to falsities; it follows therefore that they had in them the power to hurt men, for one who deceives craftily and shrewdly is especially harmful. The stings were “in their tails,” because they deceive by means of knowledges sensually perceived, knowledges both from the Word and from the world, which are what human learning consists of; they deceive by knowledges from the Word by explaining it sensually according to the letter, and not according to its interior sense; they deceive by knowledges from the world by using them for confirmation.

[2] It is believed in the world that those who are crafty and shrewd are also prudent and intelligent; but craftiness and malice are not prudence and intelligence, but viewed in themselves are insanity and folly; for such remove themselves from eternal happiness and cast themselves into eternal misery, and this is not the part of the prudent and intelligent but of the insane and foolish. Moreover, with such all things of heavenly and angelic wisdom are in dense darkness, and where that wisdom is thick darkness there is folly. That sensual men are crafty and shrewd can be seen from those who are in the hells, where all are merely natural and sensual; it can hardly be believed by anyone how much craftiness and shrewdness these possess (see in the work Heaven and Hell, n. 576–581, where the malice and wicked devices of the infernal spirits are treated of). [3] That “stings” signify craftiness can be seen without confirmation from the Word, for in common discourse the craftiness in speech by which men are deceived are called sharp points, and the talk itself is called sharp. But “stings” signify particularly interior falsities, which are such as cannot be dispelled, because they are from the knowledges and fallacies of the senses. That such falsities are signified by “stings” (or sharp points) can be seen from representatives in the spiritual world, where interior falsities are represented in various ways by sharp things, like the points of swords, the points of arrows, and things pointed in various forms, and this when they are intended to hurt; for this reason it is also forbidden there to exhibit such things to view, for spirits when they see them become furious to inflict injury. [4] These falsities are signified by “sharp instruments” in Amos: Behold the days will come upon you in which they will draw you out with barbs, and your posterity with fishhooks (4:2)."

[5] And in Moses: If ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you, then those whom ye let remain of them shall be thorns in your eyes and pricks in your sides (Num. 33:55). The “inhabitants of the land whom they were to drive out,” signify the evils and falsities of religion and of doctrine; for these were signified in an abstract sense by the nations of the land of Canaan. Therefore “they shall be thorns in your eyes” signifies the harm that will be done by malignant falsities to the truths of the church, and “pricks in your sides” signify the harm that will be done by malignant falsities to the goods of the church, “eyes” signifying in the Word the understanding of truth, and “sides” the things of charity, consequently goods. 561. And their power was to hurt men five months, signifies that while in that state they induced a stupor on the understanding of truth and on the perception of good. This is evident from the signification of “to hurt,” as being to do harm, here to induce a stupor (of which presently); also from the signification of “men,” as being those who have an understanding of truth and a perception of good, and in an abstract sense the understanding of truth and the perception of good, because from these man is a man (see above, n. 546); also from the signification of “five months,” as being while in that state (see above, n. 548). “To hurt” signifies here to induce a stupor, because it is said above that “their tails were like scorpions,” and “scorpions” signify a persuasiveness that infatuates and suffocates, and thus also induces a stupor; for this persuasiveness, as has been said above, is such with spirits as to stupefy the rational and intellectual, and thus to induce a stupor. 562.

That an “angel” means in the Word entire angelic societies which are in like good, may be seen above (n. 90, 302, 307); therefore also an “angel” in the contrary sense signifies the infernal societies which are in like evil. The hells where those are who are in the falsities of evil and who are merely sensual are here meant, because the angel is called “the angel of the abyss,” the “abyss” meaning the hell where such are (see above, n. 538), also because this is said of the “locusts,” which signify men who have become merely sensual through infernal falsities (see above, n. 543). “To have this angel as a king over them” signifies to receive influx from hell, because all evils and all falsities therefrom are from hell, and because all who are in evils and in falsities therefrom are ruled and led by the hells, therefore hell is to such as a king who rules over them, and to whom they yield obedience; and because this, while they are living in the world, is effected by influx, and efflux from hell is what leads; thence “to have a king over them” signifies to receive influx. 563.

The sensual of man, which is the ultimate of his intellectual life, is destructive of all spiritual truth and good, which is the truth and good of the church, because that sensual stands nearest to the world and clings most closely to the body; and from both these it has affections and consequent thoughts, which viewed in themselves are diametrically contrary to spiritual affections and the consequent thoughts, which are from heaven.

This anyone can see from the faculty to understand that everyone possesses; for if that which stands nearest to the world and clings most closely to the body is dominant it follows that the world itself and the body itself, with all their pleasures and lusts, which are called pleasures “of the eye and of the flesh,” will be dominant, and that man in order that he may come into spiritual affections and thoughts therefrom must be entirely withdrawn and elevated from these sensual things. This withdrawing and elevation are effected by the Lord alone, so far as man suffers himself, of the Lord, to be led to the Lord, and thus to heaven, by the laws of order which are the truths and goods of the church. When this takes place, as often as man is in a spiritual state he withdraws from this ultimate sensual and is kept elevated above it; and this also for the reason that this sensual in men is altogether corrupted, for in it is what is one’s own (proprium) into which everyone is born, which in itself is nothing but evil. From this it can be seen why this sensual is called destruction, that is, “Abaddon” and “Apollyon.” [2] It is to be known, that there are three degrees of life with every man, an inmost, a middle, and an ultimate; and that man becomes more perfect, that is, wiser, as he becomes more interior, because he thus comes so much the more interiorly into the light of heaven; also that man becomes more imperfect, that is, less wise, as he becomes more exterior, because he thus draws so much nearer to the light of the world and so much farther away from the light of heaven. From this it can be seen what is the quality of the merely sensual man who sees nothing from the light of heaven but solely from the light of the world, namely, that all things belonging to the world are to him in light and splendor, and all things belonging to heaven are in darkness and thick darkness; and when these are in darkness and in thick darkness, and the former in light and splendor, it follows that the only fire of life or the only love that incites and leads is the love of self, and the consequent love of all evils, and that the only light of life that touches and instructs the sight of the thought is that which favors the evils that are loved,"

And Aaron shall make expiation upon the horns of it once in the year of the blood of the expiations of sin; once in the year shall he make expiation upon it in your generations: this is the holy of holies unto Jehovah (Exod. 30:1–10). That these particulars respecting that altar signify in the internal sense worship from spiritual good, which is the good of charity towards the neighbor, as also the grateful hearing and acceptance by the Lord, may be seen in Arcana Coelestia (n. 10176–10213), where they are explained in series."

This is evident from the signification of “the angels at the river Euphrates,” as being reasonings from the fallacies pertaining to the sensual man (of which presently); and because reasonings from such fallacies were not before accepted in the church these angels are said to be “bound” at that river, and they are said to be “four” because of the conjunction of falsity with evil, for this number signifies in the Word the conjunction of good and truth, and in the contrary sense, as here, the conjunction of evil and falsity (see above, n. 283a, 384, 532). What precedes treats of the sensual man who is in the falsities of evil, and of the effect of the persuasions in which the sensual man is; therefore what now follows treats of the reasonings from the sensual. And because the sensual reasons only from such things as stand forth before the senses in the world, whenever it reasons respecting spiritual things, that is, the things of heaven and of the church, it reasons from fallacies, which are called the fallacies of the senses; therefore it is said here reasonings from the fallacies pertaining to the sensual man. But respecting these fallacies and reasoning from them more will be said in what follows. [2] Here the state of the church at its very end is treated of, which is the state when the men of the church, having become sensual, reason from the fallacies of the senses; and when they reason from these respecting the things of heaven and the church they believe nothing at all because they understand nothing. It is known in the church that the natural man does not perceive the things of heaven unless the Lord flows in and enlightens, which influx is through the spiritual man; much less does the sensual man"

Genuine reasonings respecting spiritual things spring from the influx of heaven into the spiritual man, and thence through the rational into the knowledges and cognitions which are in the natural man, by means of which the spiritual man confirms himself. This way of reasoning respecting spiritual things is according to order. But reasonings about spiritual things that come from the natural man, and still more those that come from the sensual man, are entirely contrary to order; for the natural man cannot flow into the spiritual man and see anything there from itself, still less can the sensual man, since there is no physical influx; but the spiritual man can flow into the natural and from that into the sensual, since there is spiritual influx. (But on this see further in the New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine, n. 51, 277, 278.) [3] From this what is meant by the things that now follow can be seen, namely, that at the very end of the church man speaks and reasons respecting spiritual things, or the things of heaven and the church, from the corporeal-sensual and thus from the fallacies of the senses; although therefore man then speaks in favor of Divine things he does not think in favor of them; for a man is able to speak in one way from the body while thinking in another way in his spirit; and while the spirit which thinks from the corporeal- sensual is unable to think in any other way than against Divine things, nevertheless from the corporeal-sensual it is able to speak in favor of them, and this especially for the reason that Divine things are to him the means of acquiring honor and gain. Every man has two memories, a natural memory and a spiritual memory, and he is able to think from either, from the natural memory when he is speaking with men in the world, but from the spiritual memory when he is speaking from the spirit; but man rarely speaks from the spirit with another, from the spirit he speaks only with himself, which is thinking. They who are sensual men are unable to speak with themselves from their spirit, or to think, in any other way than in favor of nature, consequently in favor of things corporeal and worldly, for the sensual man thinks from the sensual, and not from the spiritual; indeed, he is wholly ignorant of what the"

[4] But let us go on to explain these words, that “a voice was heard from the horns of the golden altar, saying to the sixth angel that he should loose the four angels bound at the river Euphrates.” “The river Euphrates” signifies the rational, and thence also reasoning; this is the signification of this river because it divided Assyria from the land of Canaan, and “Assyria” or “Asshur” signifies the rational, and “the land of Canaan” the spiritual. There were three rivers, besides the sea, that were boundaries of the land of Canaan, namely, the river of Egypt, the river Euphrates, and the river Jordan. “The river of Egypt” signified the knowledge (scientia) of the natural man; “the river Euphrates” signified the rational which is in man from knowledges and cognitions; and “the river Jordan” signifies entrance into the internal or spiritual church; for “the regions beyond Jordan,” where the tribes of Reuben and Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh had their inheritances allotted them, signified the external or natural church, and because that river was between those regions and the land of Canaan, and through it was the passage from one to the other, it signified entrance from the external church, which is natural, into the internal church which is spiritual. It was for this reason that baptism was there instituted, for baptism represented the regeneration of man, whereby the natural man is introduced into the church and becomes spiritual. [5] This explains what these three rivers signify in the Word. All those places also outside of the land of Canaan signified such things as belong to the natural man, while those within the land of Canaan signified such things as belong to the spiritual man, thus the things of heaven and the church. Therefore the two rivers, “the river of Egypt” (or the Nile), and “the river of Assyria” (or the Euphrates), signified the terminations of the church, and also the introductions into the church. Moreover, cognitions and knowledges which are signified by “the river of Egypt,” are what introduce, for without cognitions and knowledges no one can be introduced into the church nor perceive the things that belong to the church; for the spiritual man sees its spiritual things in knowledges by means of the rational, as man sees himself in a"

[6] But “the river of Assyria” (or the Euphrates) signifies the rational, because man by the rational is introduced into the church. By the rational is meant the thought of the natural man from cognitions and knowledges, for a man who is imbued with knowledges is able to see things in series, that is, from first and mediate things to see the last, which is called the conclusion, and can therefore analytically arrange, turn over, separate, conjoin, and at length conclude things, even to a further end, and at length to the final end; which is the use that he loves. This, then, is the rational which is given to every man according to uses, which are the ends that he loves. Since everyone’s rational comes into accord with the uses of his love, therefore it is the interior thought of the natural man from the influx of the light of heaven; and as man through rational thought is introduced into spiritual thought and becomes a church, so that river signifies the natural35 which introduces. [7] It is one thing to be rational, and another to be spiritual; every spiritual man is also rational, but the rational man is not always spiritual, since the rational is in the natural man, that is, is its thought, while the spiritual is above the rational, and through the rational passes into the natural, into the cognitions and knowledges of its memory. [8] But it is to be known that the rational does not introduce anyone into the spiritual, but it is only said to do so because such is the appearance; for the spiritual flows into the natural through the rational as a medium, and in this way it introduces. For the spiritual is the inflowing Divine, since it is the light of heaven, which is the Divine truth proceeding, and this light through the higher mind, which is called the spiritual mind, flows into the lower mind, which is called the natural mind, and conjoins this to itself, and through that conjunction causes the natural mind to make one with the spiritual; thus introduc tion is effected.

This makes evident the signification of “the four angels bound at the river Euphrates,” and afterwards the signification of “loosing” them. “The angels bound at the river Euphrates” signify the guard against man’s natural entering into the spiritual things of heaven and the church, for thence would result nothing but errors and heresies, and at length denial. [9] Moreover, in the spiritual world there are ways that lead to hell and ways that lead to heaven; also ways that lead from spiritual things to natural and thus to sensual things; and in those ways there are also guards lest anyone should go in the opposite direction, for thus he would fall into heresies and errors, as has just been said. These guards are set by the Lord at the beginning of the establishment of a church, and are also maintained, lest the man of the church from his own reason or his own understanding should invade the Divine things of the Word and thence of the church. But at the end, when the men of the church are no longer spiritual but are natural, and many are merely sensual, and thus there is no way open with the man of the church from the spiritual man into the natural, then these guards are removed and the ways are opened, and in these opened ways they advance in a contrary order, which is done by reasonings from fallacies. Thus36 it is that the man of the church speaks in favor of Divine things with the mouth, while in heart he thinks against them, that is, he is in favor of Divine things from the body and against them from the spirit; for reasoning respecting Divine things from the natural and sensual man has this effect. From this then the signification of “the four angels bound at the river Euphrates,” and their being “loosed” can now be seen. 569b.

In the sense of the letter this describes the extension of the land of Canaan, but in the internal sense it describes the extension of the church from its first boundary to its last; its first boundary is the knowing faculty (scientificum) which is of the natural man, the other boundary is the rational which is of the thought; the first, namely, the knowing faculty, which is of the natural man, is signified by “the river of Egypt,” the Nile; while the rational, which is of the thought, is signified by “the river of Assyria,” the Euphrates; to these two the spiritual church, which is signified by “the land of Canaan,” extends itself, so too does the spiritual mind which is with the man of the church.

The “vine that God caused to go forth out of Egypt” means the sons of Israel, and signifies the church, for a “vine” signifies the spiritual church, and this was signified also by “the sons of Israel”; and because the church is called a “vine,” it is said, “Thou didst plant it, Thou hast sent out its boughs even unto the sea, and its shoots unto the river,” which describes the extension of the spiritual things of the church, the “sea” meaning one of its limits, and the “river,” by which is meant the Euphrates, the other. The Euphrates: As the fourth river that went out of Eden (Gen. 2:14); also signifies the rational, for “the garden of Eden” (or Paradise) signifies wisdom. The signification of the other three rivers may be seen in Arcana Coelestia (n. 107–121). 569c.

These words signify that each and every thing of the Word is to be falsified in the church by means of reasonings from fallacies and falsities; “the waters of the river strong and many, the king of Assyria,” signifies reasonings from mere fallacies and falsities; “he shall go up over all his channels and over all his banks” signifies that by these each and every thing of the Word will be falsified; “Judah, which he will overflow and pass over,” signifies the church where the Word is, and thus the Word.

Falsifications of the Word by evils of life and falsities of doctrine, and thence reasonings that favor these, are signified by “the girdle was marred in the hole of the rock by the Euphrates.” For by means of the Word there is conjunction of the Lord with the church, and when the Word is perverted by reasonings that favor evils and falsities there is no longer any conjunction, and this also is what is meant by “the girdle was profitable for nothing.” That this was done by the Jews is evident from the Word both of the Old and New Testaments.

This has a similar meaning as “the drying up of the Sea Suph before the sons of Israel.” Those who will pass through under the Lord’s protection are signified by “the remnant of the people which shall be left from Assyria,” “those left from Assyria” signifying those who have not perished by reasonings from falsities. The following in Revelation has a similar signification: And the sixth angel poured out of his bowl upon the river Euphrates, and the water thereof was dried up, that the way of the kings who are from the rising of the sun might be made ready (16:12). This will be more fully explained below in its place. [23] From this it can now be seen that “the river Euphrates” signifies the rational by means of which the spiritual mind enters into the natural, and that in the contrary sense it signifies reasoning from fallacies and from falsities. But it is to be known that reasonings are in a like degree as the thoughts are, since they descend from the thoughts; thus there are reasonings from the spiritual man which might better be called conclusions from reasons and from truths; there are reasonings from the natural man, and there are reasonings from the sensual man. Reasonings from the spiritual man are rational, and therefore might better be called conclusions from reasons and from truths, because they are from the interior and from the light of heaven; but reasonings from the natural man respecting spiritual things are not rational, however rational they may be in things moral and civil, which are evident before the eyes, because they are from natural light alone; but reasonings from the sensual man respecting spiritual things are irrational, because they are from fallacies and thus from ideas that are false; these are the reasonings here treated of in Revelation. 570.

This license was now granted because the sensual man only reasons from such things as he sees in the world with his eyes, while the things that are within and above these he declares cannot be, since he does not see them; this is why the things that belong to heaven and the church, because they are above his thoughts, he either denies or does not believe, but ascribes all things to nature. Thus the sensual man thinks by himself or in his spirit, but otherwise before the world, for before the world he speaks from his memory, even about spiritual things from the Word or from the doctrine of the church; and what he says has a similar sound as when a spiritual man says it. Such is the state of men of the church at its end; and although they fit together words which they speak or preach seemingly from a spiritual origin, they nevertheless flow from the ultimate sensual in which their spirit is, and this when left to itself reasons against them, because it reasons from fallacies, consequently from falsities. 571. That had been prepared for the hour, and day, and month, and year, signifies continually in the state. This is evident from the signification of “being prepared for the hour and day and month and year,” as being to be continually in the state, that is, of depriving themselves of all understanding of truth, and thence of spiritual life, which is signified by what follows, namely, “that they should kill the third part of men”; for “hours,” “days,” “months,” and “years,” signify in the Word the states of life in particular and in general, therefore “to be prepared for” these periods signifies to be continually in that state. “Hours,” “days,” “months,” and “years,” do not mean hours, days, months, and years, because in the spiritual world times are not divided into such intervals, for the sun from which the angelic heaven has its light and its heat is not carried around as the sun in the natural world is apparently, therefore it does not cause years, months, days, or hours; but times in the spiritual world, although they succeed each other as times do in the natural world, are distinguished by the states of life.

That an “hour,” signifies state, so also a “day,” a “month,” and a “year,” in like manner, is evident from the passages in the Word in which they are mentioned, but to quote those passages here would be too lengthy. (This, however, can be seen from what is shown respecting Time in the work Heaven and Hell; also Arcana Coelestia, that “times” do not signify in the Word times, but states of life, n. 2788, 2837, 3254, 3356, 4814, 4901, 4916, 7218, 8070, 10133, 10605.) “Times” signify states for the reason that in the spiritual world there are no stated times of the day called morning, noon, evening, and night, nor stated times of the year called spring, summer, autumn, and winter; nor are there changes of light and shade, of heat and cold, as in our world, but instead of these there are changes of state in respect to love and faith; and from these no idea can be had of the intervals into which our times are divided, although times have progression there as in the natural world (as to this see Arcana Coelestia, n. 1274, 1382, 3356, 4882, 6110, 7218). And as the sun of the angelic heaven, which is the Lord, is continually in its rising, and makes no revolutions as the sun of our world apparently does, but there are instead merely changes of state with the angels and spirits according to their reception of the good of love and the truth of faith, therefore times correspond to changes of state and signify them (Arcana Coelestia, n. 4901, 7381). Therefore angels and spirits think apart from any idea of time, which man cannot do (Arcana Coelestia, n. 3404). 572. That they should kill the third part of men, signifies of depriving themselves of all understanding of truth, and thus of spiritual life. This is evident from the signification of “to kill,” as being to deprive of spiritual life (see above, n. 547); and from the signification of “men,” as being the understanding of truth (see also above, n. 546, 547); “the third part,” in reference to truths, means all (see above, n. 506); so here “to kill the third part of men” signifies the deprivation of all understanding of truth.

They thus deprive themselves of spiritual life, because man has spiritual life through his understanding, for he becomes a spiritual man in the measure in which his understanding is opened and permits itself to be enlightened by means of truths. But it is by means of truths from good that the understanding is opened, not by means of truths without good; for man thinks truth so far as he lives in the good of love and charity. Truth indeed is the form of good, and all good with man is of his will, and all truth is of his understanding; therefore the good of the will presents its form in the understanding, and the form itself is thought from the understanding which is from the will. 573a. Verse 16. And the number of the armies of the horsemen was two myriads of myriads, signifies that the falsities of evil from which and in favor of which they reason and which conspire against the truths of good, are innumerable. This is evident from the signification of “armies,” as meaning the falsities of evil (of which presently); and from the signification of “horsemen,” as being the reasonings therefrom, for “horses” signify the understanding of truth, and in the contrary sense the understanding perverted and destroyed (see above, n. 355, 364, 372a, 373, 381, 382); so “horsemen” in this sense signify the reasonings from falsities, since reasonings from falsities are from the understanding perverted and destroyed, for truths constitute the understanding, but falsities destroy it. The above is evident also from the signification of “two myriads of myriads,” as being innumerable falsities conspiring against truths of good (that “myriads” signify things innumerable, and are predicated of truths, see above, n. 336), and it is said “two myriads of myriads” because this signifies things innumerable that are conjoined and conspire; for the number “two” signifies conjunction, concord, and conspiracy (see above, n. 283, 384). It means against the truths of good, because what follows treats of the destruction of truths by the armies of such horsemen. From this it can be seen that “the number of the armies of the horsemen was two myriads of myriads” signifies that the falsities of evil from which and in favor of which they reason, and which conspire against the truths of good, are innumerable."

Such is the signification of “armies” in the Word, because “wars” in the Word, both in the histories and prophecies, signify, in the internal sense spiritual wars, which are waged against hell and against the diabolical crew there, and such wars have relation to truths and goods opposing falsities and evils; this is why “armies” signify all truths from good, and in the contrary sense all falsities from evil. That “armies” signify all truths from good is evident from the sun, moon, stars, and also the angels, being called “the armies of Jehovah,” because they signify all truths from good in the complex; also from the sons of Israel being called “armies,” because they signified the truths and goods of the church. And as all truths and goods are from the Lord, and the Lord alone fights for all in heaven and for all in the church against the falsities and evils which are from hell, so He is called “Jehovah Zebaoth,” that is, “Jehovah of Hosts.” [3] That the sun, the moon, and the stars are called “hosts” is evident from the following passages. In Moses: Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them (Gen. 2:1). In David: By the word of Jehovah were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of His mouth (Ps. 33:6).

In Isaiah: And all the host of the heavens shall waste away, and the heavens shall be rolled up as a scroll; and all their hosts shall fall down, as the leaf falleth off from the vine, and as that which falleth from the fig tree (34:4)."

In Jeremiah: As the host of the heavens is not numbered, and the sand of the sea is not measured (33:22). In these passages, the sun, moon, and stars, are called a “host” because the “sun” signifies the good of love, the “moon” truth from good, and the “stars” the knowledges of truth and good, consequently they signify goods and truths in the whole complex, and these are called a “host” because they resist evils and falsities, and perpetually conquer them as enemies. [4] In Daniel: One horn of the he-goat waxed great even to the host of the heavens; and some of the host and of the stars it cast down to the earth, and trampled upon them. Yea, it magnified itself even to the Prince of the Host; and the continual offering was taken away from him, and the dwelling place of his sanctuary was cast down. And the host was given to the continual offering for transgression, because it cast down the truth to the earth. Then one holy one said, How long shall be the vision, the continual offering, and the wasting transgression, that the holy place and the host be given to be trodden down? And he said, Even to the evening, the morning (Dan. 8:10–14). What is here signified by the “he-goat,” “his horns,” and this “horn that waxed great even to the host of the heavens,” may be seen above (n. 316c, 336b, 535). “The host of the heavens, some of which it cast down to the earth,” means the truths and goods of heaven; for the last state of the church, when the truths and goods of heaven are esteemed as of no account, and rejected, is here treated of, and this is signified by “treading them down”; therefore it is added, “it cast down truth to the earth.” “The Prince of the Host” means the Lord, who is also called “Jehovah God Zebaoth” (or of Hosts). That all worship from the good of love and from the truths of faith would perish is signified by “the continual offering"

[5] That the angels are called “hosts” is evident from the following passages. In Joel: Jehovah uttered His voice before His host; for His camp was very great (2:11). In Zechariah: I will set a camp for my house from my host, because of him that passeth away and of him that returneth, that no exactor may again pass through over them (9:8).

And one said in this manner, and another said in that manner (22:19, 20). In Revelation: His hosts in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean (19:14).

[6] For the same reason the sons of Israel, because they signify the truths and goods of the church, are called “hosts,” as in the following passages. In Moses: Jehovah said, Bring out the sons of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their hosts (Exod. 6:26). I will bring forth My host, My people, the sons of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments (Exod. 7:4; 12:17). It came to pass on that very day that all the hosts of Jehovah went forth from the land of Egypt (Exod. 12:41). Thou shalt number all that go forth into the host (Num. 1:3, et seq.). They were to pitch about the Tent of meeting, and were also to go forth according to their hosts (Num. 2:3, 9, 16, 24). The Levites were to be taken to perform the warfare, to do the work in the Tent of meeting (Num. 4:3, 23, 30, 39). The sons of Israel were called the “hosts of Jehovah” because they represented the church, and signified all its truths and goods (as can be seen in Arcana Coelestia, n. 5414, 5801, 5803, 5806, 5812, 5817, 5819, 5826, 5833, 5879, 5951, 6637, 6862, 6868, 7035, 7062, 7198, 7201, 7215, 7223, 7957, 8234, 8805, 9340). They were called “hosts,” in the plural, because each tribe was called a “host,” as can be seen in Moses, when it was commanded him to number them all according to their hosts, and they were numbered according to their tribes (Num. 1, 3, et seq.); likewise when the camp was pitched about the Tent of meeting according to the tribes, it is said “according to their hosts” (Num. 2:3, 9, et seq.).

[8] From this it is now evident that “hosts” signify the truths and goods of heaven and the church in the whole complex; and as most things in the Word have also a contrary sense, so do “hosts,” and in that sense they signify falsities and evils in their whole complex, as in the following passages in Jeremiah: Upon the roofs of the houses they have burned incense unto all the host of the heavens, and have poured out drink offerings unto other gods (19:13). In Zephaniah: They worship upon the roofs the host of the heavens (1:5). In Moses: Lest thou bow thyself down to and serve the sun and the moon and the stars, and all the host of the heavens (Deut. 4:19; 17:3). In Jeremiah: They shall spread out the bones taken from the graves before the sun and the moon and all the host of the heavens, whom they have loved and whom they have served (8:2).

For everywhere in the spiritual world there is an equilibrium between heaven and hell; and where there is an equilibrium, there two forces continually act against each other; one acts and the other reacts, and continual action and reaction is continual combat; but equilibrium is provided by the Lord (on this see the work Heaven and Hell, n. 589–596, and n. 597–603). And as there is such continual combat between Heaven and Hell, therefore as all things of heaven are called “hosts,” so are all things of hell; all things of heaven have reference to goods and truths, and all things of hell to evils and falsities. [9] This then is why “hosts” in the following passages signify the falsities of evil. In Isaiah: The anger of Jehovah is against all nations, and His wrath against all their host; He hath devoted them, He hath given them to the slaughter (34:2). “Nations” signify evils, and “host” the falsities from evil; their total destruction is signified by “He hath devoted and hath given to the slaughter.” [10] In the same: The voice of the multitude in the mountains like as of a great people; the voice of a tumult of the kingdoms of the nations gathered together; Jehovah of Hosts leadeth the host (Isa. 13:4)."

And he shall stir up his powers and his heart against the king of the south with a great army; and the king of the south shall engage in battle with an exceeding great and mighty army, but he shall not stand (11:13, 25). This chapter treats of the war between the king of the north and the king of the south, and “the king of the north” means those within the church who are in the falsities of evil, and “the king of the south” those who are in the truths of good; collision and combat at the end of the church are described in the spiritual sense by their war; therefore “the army of the king of the north” means falsities of every kind, and “the army of the king of the south” truths of every kind.

He hath made us to turn back from the adversary (Ps. 44:9, 10). “God hath not gone forth in our armies” signifies that He did not defend them, because they were in the falsities of evil, for “armies” mean the falsities of evil; therefore it is also said “He hath cast us off and confounded us, and hath made us to turn back from the adversary,” “the adversary” meaning evil which is from hell. [15] In Joel: I will recompense to you the years that the locust hath eaten, the cankerworm and the caterpillar and the palmerworm, My great army which I sent among you (2:25). That an “army” signifies falsities and evils of every kind is plainly evident, since these noxious little animals, “the locust, the cankerworm, the caterpillar, and the palmerworm,” signify falsities and evils that devastate or consume the truths and goods of the church (see above, n. 543c, where this passage is explained, and it is shown that the “locust and caterpillar” signify the falsities [and evils] of the sensual man.) This makes clear what “army” signifies in the Word in both senses. “Army” has the same signification in the histories of the Word, for these contain a spiritual sense as well as the prophecies, but it shines forth from them less clearly, because the mind, when intent on the historical meaning, cannot easily be raised above the worldly things in the history and see the spiritual things that are stored up in them. 574.

[2] Visions, which and from which a man or the spirit of man sees, are of a twofold kind; there are real visions and visions that are not real; real visions are visions of such things as really appear in the spiritual world, corresponding altogether with the thoughts and affections of angels, consequently they are real correspondences.

And as “the horses and those that sat on them” were seen by John in such visions, they signify reasonings from fallacies, and thence falsifications of the Word. [3] As the prophets, by whom the Word was written, had real visions, and others who were also called prophets had visions that were not real, but their visions were vain and are called “lies,” it is important that it should be known what visions are. All things that really appear in the spiritual world are correspondences, for they correspond to the interiors of angels, which are the things of their minds, that is, of their affection and of their thought therefrom, and therefore such things are signified by them. For the spiritual, which is of the affection and the consequent thought of the angels, clothes itself with such forms as appear in the three kingdoms of the natural world, the animal, the vegetable, and the mineral, and all these forms are correspondences, such as appeared to the prophets, and which signify the things to which they corresponded. But in the spiritual world there can be appearances also that are not correspondences; and these are produced by spirits, especially evil spirits, by means of fantasies, for by means of fantasies such spirits can present to the view palaces, and houses full of decorations, also decorated garments; they can also induce upon themselves beautiful faces, and other like appearances; but as soon as the fantasy ceases all these things vanish, because they are external in which there is nothing internal. As such visions are from fantasies they signify fallacies because they deceive the senses and fallaciously present to view things like real things. Because such fallacies are here signified, it is said, “I saw horses in vision.” As reasonings from fallacies are here treated of, what fallacies are is to be told. [4] There are many fallacies in natural, in civil, in moral, and in spiritual affairs; but as fallacies in spiritual things are the fallacies here meant, I wish to show by some examples what and of what nature fallacies in spiritual things are.

They do not believe that such things exist in the spiritual world, because they suppose anything that cannot be seen with the eyes or perceived by some sense of the body is a nonentity.

This they say and believe because they think from the fallacies of the bodily senses. They who reason and draw conclusions from the fallacies of the senses attribute all things to nature, and scarcely anything to the Divine; if they attribute creation to the Divine, they imagine, nevertheless, that all things were transferred into nature, and that all the effects that appear flow from nature alone, and nothing from the spiritual world; as when they see the wonderful things that pertain to silkworms, butterflies, bees, the wonderful things in the generation of all animals from eggs, and innumerable other like things, they imagine nature to be the sole artificer of these things, and are unable to think at all about the spiritual world and its influx into the natural, and about the existence and subsistence of such wonderful things as being from that source; and yet the truth is that the Divine flows in continually through the spiritual world into the natural, and produces such things, and that nature was created to serve for the clothing of these things that proceed and flow in from the spiritual world.

[2] In regard to “hyacinthine,” it signifies in the spiritual sense the heavenly love of truth, but in the contrary sense the diabolical love of falsity, and also love of the world; as can be seen from its being of the color of heaven, and that color signifies truth from a heavenly origin, so in the contrary sense, falsity from a diabolical origin. In the spiritual world the choicest colors appear; and these have their origin in good and truth; for colors there are modifications of heavenly light, thus of the intelligence and wisdom, that are with the angels in heaven. This is why hyacinthine, purple, and scarlet double-dyed were interwoven in the curtains of the tabernacle and in the garments of Aaron; for the tabernacle represented the heaven of the Lord, and the garments of Aaron the Divine truth of heaven and the church, and those things of which the tabernacle was constructed, and of which the garments of Aaron were woven, represented celestial and spiritual things, which are of Divine good and Divine truth.

The loops on the edge of the curtain of the tent were hyacinthine (Exod. 26:4); The ephod was of gold, hyacinthine, purple, and scarlet double- dyed interwoven (Exod. 28:6); And also the breastplate of judgment (verse 15); When the camp set forward in the wilderness, Aaron and his sons spread a cloth of hyacinthine over the ark, over the table of faces, over the lampstand and the lamps, over the golden altar, and over all the vessels of ministry (Num. 4:6, 7, 9, 11, 12). This is because Divine truth proceeding from Divine love, which is signified by “the cloth of hyacinthine,” embraces and protects all the holy things of heaven and the church, which the things covered represent. [4] Because “hyacinthine” signified the celestial love of truth, it was commanded: That the sons of Israel should make for themselves a fringe in the borders of their garments, and should put on it a cord of hyacinthine, that in looking upon it they might remember all the commandments of Jehovah and do them (Num. 15:38, 39). Here “the cord of hyacinthine” stands evidently for the remembrance of the commandments of Jehovah; the commandments of Jehovah are the essential truths of heaven and the church, and these are remembered only by such as are in a celestial love of truth.

These were thy traffickers with choice wares, with bales of hyacinthine and broidered work, and with treasures of precious garments (27:7, 24). This is said of Tyre, which signifies the church in respect to the knowledges of truth; so, too, it signifies the knowledges of truth belonging to the church, and her “merchandise and tradings” mentioned in this chapter describe the acquisition of intelligence by means of such knowledges; “broidered work from Egypt” signifies the knowledge (scientia) of such things as are of the church; and because this has a lower place, and is thus round about or without, it is called “a spreading forth,” and is said to be “for an ensign.” “Hyacinthine and purple from the isles of Elishah” signify the spiritual affection of truth and good; therefore these are said to be “for a covering,” a “covering” signifying truth. “Bales of hyacinthine and broidered work” signify all truths, spiritual and natural, and these together with the knowledges from the Word are meant by “the treasures of precious garments.” [6] As “hyacinthine” signifies the heavenly love of truth, so in the contrary sense it signifies the diabolical love of falsity; and in that sense also “hyacinthine” is mentioned in the Word. Thus in Ezekiel: Two women, the daughters of one mother, committed whoredom in Egypt in their youth. Oholah which is Samaria, and Oholibah which is Jerusalem. And Oholah committed whoredom while under me, and she doted on her lovers, the Assyrians her neighbors, which were clothed in hyacinthine, governors and rulers, all of them young men of desire, horsemen riding upon horses (23:2–6). Here “Samaria” and “Jerusalem” signify the church, “Samaria” the spiritual church, and “Jerusalem” the celestial church, which are called “Oholah” and “Oholibah” because these names mean a “tent,” and a “tent” signifies the church in respect to worship; “woman” also in the Word signifies the church; “they committed whoredom in Egypt” signifies the falsification of the truths of the church by the knowledges of the natural man; “she doted on the Assyrians” signifies the falsification by reasonings from those"

And because of this same appearance they are also called “governors and rulers, young men of desire, riding upon horses,” for those who reason from self-intelligence appear to themselves and to others of like character to be intelligent and wise, and the things they speak to be truths of intelligence and goods of wisdom, when yet they are falsities which they love because they are from what is their own (proprium); “governors and rulers” signify principal truths, and “those riding upon horses” signify the intelligent. [7] In Jeremiah: Silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the workman and of the hands of the refiner; their garments38 are hyacinthine and purple; all are the work of the wise (10:9). This treats of the idols of the house of Israel, which signify doctrinals that are false, because they are from self-intelligence; therefore they are called “the work of the workman and of the hands of the refiner, and all the work of the wise,” and this because these doctrinals appear to them to be truths and goods; “silver from Tarshish and gold from Uphaz,” signifies what appears in external form to be truth and good, because from the sense of the letter of the Word. From this it can be seen that “hyacinthine” signifies the love of what is false because it is from self (proprium) or from self- intelligence. “Hyacinthine” also signifies the love of the world, because the love of the world corresponds to the love of falsity, as the love of self, which is signified by “fire,” corresponds to the love of evil; for all evil is from the love of self, and all falsity is from the love of the world which has its origin in the love of self; for spiritual evil, which is meant by the love of the world, is in its essence falsity, as spiritual good is in its essence truth (see in the work Heaven and Hell, n. 15). 577a.

(That a “lion” signifies Divine truth in respect to power, and in the contrary sense falsity destroying truth, may be seen above, n. 278.) The “heads of horses” signify knowledge and thought therefrom, because “head” signifies intelligence, and “the horse” the understanding; and as the sensual man and here his reasoning from falsities are treated of, and the sensual man who reasons from falsities has no intelligence, but only knowledge and thought therefrom, therefore these are here signified by “the heads of the horses.” (That those who are in falsities have no intelligence, but instead of intelligence only knowledge, may be seen in the New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine, n. 33.) [2] The “head” signifies intelligence, because the understanding and the will of man have their seat in the interiors of his head; consequently in the front part of the head, which is the face, are the senses of sight, hearing, smell, and taste, into which the understanding and the will flow from the interior and vivify them, and also cause them to enjoy their sensations; this is why the “head” signifies in the Word intelligence. But as those only who receive influx from heaven are intelligent, for all intelligence and wisdom flow in out of heaven from the Lord, it follows that they who are in the falsities of evil have no intelligence; for in them the higher and spiritual mind is closed, and only the lower mind, which is called the natural mind, is opened; and when the higher mind is closed the lower receives nothing of truth and good, consequently no intelligence from heaven, but only from the world. Such, therefore, in place of intelligence have mere knowledge and thought from it, and from this proceeds reasoning, and by means of it the confirmation of falsity and evil against truth and good."

In Ezekiel: I put a jewel upon thy nose, and earrings in thine ears, and a crown of adorning upon thy head (16:12). This is said of Jerusalem, which signifies the church, here such as it was in the beginning; “a jewel upon the nose” signifies the perception of truth from good; “the earrings in the ears” signify hearkening and obedience, and “a crown upon the head” signifies wisdom; for intelligence, which is from Divine truth, becomes wisdom from the good of love, and this is signified by “a crown of gold.” [4] In Revelation: A woman encompassed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars (12:1). The “head” upon which was a crown of twelve stars, signifies intelligence, as will be seen in the explanation hereafter. That the Jews placed a crown of thorns upon the Lord’s head, and that they smote His head (Matt. 27:29, 30; Mark 15:17, 19; John 19:2); signifies that they treated with such contumely Divine truth itself and Divine wisdom; for they falsified the Word, which is Divine truth and in which is Divine wisdom, and adulterated it by their traditions and by applying it to themselves; thus they desired a king who would exalt them over all in the whole earth. And as the Lord’s kingdom was not earthly but heavenly, they perverted everything that was said respecting Him in the Word, and mocked at what was foretold of Him. This is what was represented by “their placing a crown of thorns upon His head, and smiting His head.” [5] Where the statue of Nebuchadnezzar seen in a dream is described, it is said in Daniel:"

In David: Thou hast brought us into the net; thou hast laid oppressions39 upon our loins.

That they shall come upon “the crown of the head of the Nazirite of his brethren” signifies that they should also take place in the exteriors of his natural mind, for the “Naziriteship” signifies the exteriors of the natural mind, since it means the hairs, or the hair of the head.

[9] In Ezekiel: Son of man, take thee a sharp sword, a barber’s razor, and cause it to pass over41 the head and over the beard; a third part thou shalt burn with fire, a third part thou shalt smite with the sword, and a third part thou shalt disperse in the wind (5:1, 2). Here also “to cause a razor to pass over the head” signifies to deprive of all intelligence of truth; for the reason that intelligence perishes when there are no ultimates of intelligence, which are signified by “the hairs of the head, which should be shaved with a razor by causing it to pass over the head”; for when ultimates are taken away it is as when the base is taken away from a column, or the foundation from a house. This is why it was unlawful in the Jewish church, which was a representative church, to shave the hairs of the head and induce baldness, in like manner the beard; so also those who are without intelligence appear bald in the spiritual world. 577b. [10] From all this the signification of “a bald head” and “baldness” in the following passages can be seen. In Isaiah: On all their heads is baldness, every beard is cut off (15:2); in other words, there is no intelligence. In Ezekiel: Shame shall be upon all faces, and baldness upon all heads (7:18). Every head was made bald, and every shoulder was peeled (29:18). These words have a similar meaning. So Aaron and his sons were forbidden to shave their heads and the corner of the beard, of which it is said in Moses: That Aaron and his sons shall not shave their heads nor rend their clothes, lest they die, and lest Jehovah be angry in consequence with the whole congregation (Lev. 10:5)."

The “beard” signifies the ultimate of the rational man, and “not shaving the beard” signifies not to be deprived of the rational, by taking away its ultimate; for, as was said above, when the ultimate is taken away the interior also perishes. What is meant by: When a woman taken captive from the enemy is desired for a wife she must shave her head and pare her nails (Deut. 21:11, 12); may be seen explained above (n. 555c). [11] Because shame was represented by the hands upon the head, it is said in Jeremiah: Thou shalt be ashamed of Egypt also, as thou wast ashamed of Assyria. From her also thou shalt go forth with thy hands upon thy head (2:36, 37). They were ashamed and put to confusion and covered their heads (14:3, 4). Because this was a representative of shame: Tamar, after she had been ravished by her brother Amnon, put her hand on her head, and went weeping42 and crying (2 Sam. 13:19). To “put the hand upon the head” signified that no intelligence remained. Also grief for sin in having acted insanely and foolishly was represented by sprinkling dust upon the head, and by bowing the head down even to the earth; and by this cursing also was signified.

In David: The Lord at thy right hand hath stricken through kings in the day of His anger; He hath judged among the nations; He hath filled with dead bodies; He hath stricken through the head over many a land; He shall drink out of the brook in the way; therefore shall He exalt the head (Ps. 110:5–7).

[2] That this is the signification of “brimstone” can be seen from passages of the Word where it is mentioned. Thus in Moses: Jehovah made brimstone and fire to rain upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah (Gen. 19:24). In Luke: In the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all. After the same manner shall it be in the day that the Son of man is revealed (17:29, 30). Those who were in Sodom and Gomorrah mean those who are in the falsities of evil from the love of self; and since the falsities of evil from that love destroyed them, it rained brimstone and fire, “brimstone” because of the lust of destroying the church by the falsities of evil, and “fire” because that lust burst forth from the love of self. That it should be thus “when the Son of man should be revealed,” signifies that then, too, falsities of evil from the love of self will destroy the church. Such rain appears in the spiritual world when the evil who are in falsities from that love are cast down into hell.

For when a man thinks from mere fallacies he thinks solely from such things as stand forth at first sight in the sense of the letter, and not from any interior literal sense; consequently he forms the most gross and harsh ideas respecting every doctrine he derives from the Word, as that God is angry, that He punishes, casts men into hell, tempts them, that He repents, and many like things; moreover, he thinks corporeally and materially, and not at all spiritually, about everything he reads in the Word; for this reason his thought is merely sensual, and when it is merely sensual it is solely from the love of self and of the world, and when it is from these it is solely from evils and falsities. When such a man, therefore, is left to himself and thinks from his spirit, he thinks from the affection of these loves, which he conjoins to the things that are in the Word; and when the Divine things of the Word are conjoined to such loves all things therein are adulterated and falsified, for the Divine things of the Word can never be conjoined to anything but celestial love, or with spiritual affection; if conjoined to any other love or any other affection, the higher mind, which is called the spiritual mind, is closed, and the lower mind only, which is called the natural mind, is opened; yea, with those who conjoin the truths of the Word to the affection of the love of self, the natural mind also is closed, and only the ultimate of this mind is opened, which is called the sensual, which clings most closely to the body, and stands forth nearest to the world. Thus does man’s spirit become corporeal, and then it can have no lot with the angels, who are spiritual. 580. Verse 19.

This is evident from the signification of “their power,” as being to have power, here to have most power; and from the signification of the “mouth,” as being the sensual thought and reasonings therefrom. For the “mouth” and the things belonging to the mouth signify the things of the understanding and of thought and speech therefrom, for these correspond to the mouth. For all the organs that are included in the one term “mouth,” as the larynx, the glottis, the throat, the tongue, the mouth, the lips, are organs that serve the understanding for utterance and for speech, and this is why the “mouth” signifies the thought and reasoning therefrom. But as man’s thought is interior and exterior, that is spiritual, natural, and sensual, so the “mouth” signifies such thought as pertains to the man treated of, here sensual thought, because it is the man who is made sensual by falsities of evil who is treated of; sensual thought is the lowest thought of all, and is material and corporeal; in such thought are all who are in evils with respect to life, and in consequent falsities in respect to doctrine, however learned and accomplished they may be believed to be, and whatever ability they may have to fit together their falsities in a beautiful order, and to embellish them with elegant and eloquent discourse. [2] That the “mouth” from correspondence, thus in the spiritual sense, signifies thought, but in the natural sense utterance, can be seen from the following passages. In David: The mouth of the righteous meditateth wisdom (Ps. 37:30). The “mouth” here signifies thought from affection, for man from that meditates wisdom, but not from the mouth and its speech. In Luke: Jesus said, I will give you a mouth and wisdom which they will not be able to oppose (21:15). Here the mouth evidently stands for speech from the understanding, thus for the thought from which man speaks. In Matthew:"

Out of the heart go forth evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false testimonies, blasphemies (15:11, 17–19). “That which entereth into the mouth” means in the literal sense food of every kind, which, after its use in the body, goes out through the belly into the draught; but in the spiritual sense, “that which entereth into the mouth” signifies all things that enter into the thought from the memory, and also from the world, and these also correspond to food; while the things that enter into the thought, and not also into the will, do not render a man unclean; for the memory, and thought therefrom, are to man only as a way of entrance to him, since the will is the man himself. The things that merely enter the thought and go no further are cast out as it were through the belly into the draught, “the belly” signifying from correspondence the world of spirits, from which thoughts flow in with man, and the “draught” signifying hell. [3] It must be known that man cannot be purified from evils and the consequent falsities, unless the unclean things that are in him come forth as far as into the thought, and are there seen, recognized, discerned, and put away. This makes evident that “that which entereth into the mouth” signifies in the spiritual sense what enters into the thought from the memory and from the world; while “that which cometh out of the mouth” signifies in the spiritual sense thought from the will or from love; for the “heart,” from which thought goes forth into the mouth and from the mouth, signifies man’s will and love; and as the love and will constitute the whole man, for the man is such as his love is, so the things that go forth therefrom into the mouth and out of the mouth are what make the man unclean. That these are evils of every kind is evident from the things enumerated. Such is the meaning of these words of the Lord in the heavens.

To reason by means of such knowledges is meant, because the “head,” in reference to the sensual man, signifies knowledge and fatuous thought therefrom (see above, n. 577a), and accordingly also reasonings by means of sensual knowledges. From this it can be seen that “the tails of the horses were like serpents, and had heads,” signifies that from sensual knowledges which are fallacies they reason craftily.

[2] That “serpents” signify in the Word the sensual man in respect to craftiness and in respect to prudence, can be seen from the following passages. In Moses: The serpent was more crafty than any wild beast of the field which Jehovah God had made (Gen. 3:1). “Serpent” here does not mean a serpent, but the sensual man, and in a general sense the sensual itself, which is the ultimate of the human understanding; “the man and his wife” signify the most ancient church, which fell away when the men of that church began to reason from sensual knowledges respecting Divine things, which is signified by “eating of the tree of knowledge”; their craftiness in reasoning respecting Divine things from the sensual is described by the reasoning of the serpent with Adam’s wife, by which they were deceived. The serpent is said to have been “more crafty than any wild beast of the field,” because it is poisonous and its bite is therefore deadly, and because it hides itself in lurking places. “Poison” signifies craft and deceit, and therefore the “bite” of the serpent signifies deadly hurt; and the lurking places from which it bites, and in which it conceals itself, signify craftiness. [3] It is to be known that all beasts signify affections such as are in man, and “serpents” signify the affections of the sensual man, for the reason that they creep on the belly upon the ground as does the sensual of man, for this is in the lowest place, and creeps as it were upon the ground beneath all the other faculties. Moreover, sensual men in the spiritual world dwell in the lower parts, and cannot be elevated towards the higher parts, since they are in externals, and from these they judge and form conclusions respecting everything.

[4] This, then, is why the devil or hell is called “a serpent” in the following passages. In Revelation: The dragon, the old serpent, the devil and Satan, which seduceth the whole world (12:9, 14, 15; 20:2). In David: They have sharpened their tongue like a serpent; adder’s poison is under their lips (Ps. 40:3); which signifies their crafty and delusive deception. In the same: Their poison is like the poison of a serpent (Ps. 58:4). In Job: He shall suck the poison of asps; the viper’s tongue shall slay him (20:16) And in Isaiah: They hatched adder’s eggs, and wove spider’s webs; he that eateth of their eggs dieth, and when one is crushed there breaketh out a viper (59:5). This is said of evil men, who by deceit and craft seduce others in spiritual things; the hidden evils to which they allure by their craftiness are signified by “adder’s eggs, which they are said to hatch”; their deceitful falsities are signified by “the spider’s webs which they weave”; the deadly hurt when they are received is signified by “he that eateth of their eggs dieth, and when one is crushed there breaketh out a viper.”"

The “suckling” and the “weaned child” signify those who are in the good of innocence, that is, those who are in love to the Lord; and “the hole of the adder” and the “basilisk’s den” mean the hells in which are deceitful and crafty spirits, and the entrances into these appear like gloomy holes, and within they are like dens. [6] That the craft and malice of infernal spirits can do no harm to those whom the Lord protects is signified also by these words of the Lord: That the disciples would have power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy (Luke 10:19). Also that they would have power to take up serpents, and to drink any deadly thing, and it would not hurt them (Mark 16:18). “To tread on serpents” signifies to despise and make light of the deceits, craft, and wicked arts of the infernal crew; therefore it is added, “and over all the power of the enemy”; “the enemy” is that crew, and “his power” its craftiness. 581b.

And in Micah: They shall lick the dust like a serpent (7:17); “dust” signifying what is damned, and “to go upon the belly” signifying the sensual, which is the ultimate of life in man; and as this is the ultimate of life, it is in no intelligence or wisdom, but in craftiness and cunning, which are contrary to intelligence and wisdom.

Again, sensual things which are the ultimates of man’s life are signified by: The fiery serpents sent among the people who wished to return to Egypt (Num. 21:6); while the healing of the bite of such serpents by the Lord’s Divine sensual is signified by: The brazen serpent set upon a standard, by looking upon which they revived (Num. 21:5–9). The expression, the Lord’s Divine sensual, is used, because the Lord when He was in the world glorified, that is, made Divine, His whole Human even to its ultimates, as can be seen from the fact that He left nothing in the sepulcher, and that He said to the disciples: That He hath bones and flesh, which a spirit doth not have (Luke 24:39, 40). The ultimate sensual, which was also glorified or made Divine by the Lord, is signified by that “brazen serpent” set upon a standard, respecting which the Lord Himself thus spake in John: As Moses lifted up the serpent, even so must the Son of man be lifted up; that whosoever believeth in Him may not perish, but may have eternal life (3:14, 15).

This is evident from the signification of “to hurt,” as being to pervert the truths and goods of the church by means of crafty reasonings from sensual knowledges or fallacies; for the “horses” in the vision, about whose tails this is said, signify the falsifications of the Word by reasonings from fallacies (see above, n. 575). From the way these horses appeared to John, what the representative appearances in heaven are can be seen, namely, that affections there, when represented by animals, are presented in the forms of such animals as appear in our world, and yet everywhere with variety in respect to their parts, especially the face, the particulars of which from correspondence signify various things of the affection so represented; as here there were seen “horses, whose heads were as the heads of lions, and their tails like serpents, and had heads,” and those who sat upon the horses had “breastplates, fiery, hyacinthine and brimstone-like.” [2] Animals of various forms appear daily in the spiritual world, and also I have often seen them; and by a knowledge of correspondences, it is there known what the particulars signify. For all the affections that flow from the minds of angels are imaged before their eyes by animals of all kinds that exist on the earth, in the air, or in the sea; likewise by the subjects of all things that are in the vegetable kingdom of the earth, and by the subjects of all things that are in the mineral kingdom of the earth. This is why such things in our world have been made representative of celestial and spiritual things. Such representatives exist in the spiritual world, because in that world there are spiritual things interior and exterior; interior spiritual things are all such as belong to affection, and to thought therefrom, or to the understanding of truth and the wisdom of good; and exterior spiritual things are so created by the Lord as to clothe or invest interior spiritual things; and when these are clothed and invested, there come into existence such forms as are in the natural world, and thus into these forms interior spiritual things finally close, and in them have their ultimate existence."

Everyone that passeth by Babylon shall hiss at all her plagues (50:13).

Also every disease and every plague which is not written in the book of this law will Jehovah secretly send upon thee until thou be destroyed (Deut. 28:58, 59, 61). “Plagues” here signify spiritual plagues, which destroy the soul, not the body, and which are enumerated in this chapter of Deuteronomy (verses 20–68). [4] What “plagues” signify in the spiritual sense is described by correspondences in Zechariah: This shall be the plague wherewith Jehovah will plague all the peoples that shall wage war against Jerusalem; his flesh shall waste away as he standeth upon his feet, and his eyes shall waste away in their sockets, and his tongue shall waste away in his mouth. So shall be the plague of the horse, of the mule, of the camel, of the ass, and of every beast that shall be in those camps, as this plague (14:12, 15).

That “one’s flesh shall waste away as he standeth upon his feet” signifies that with those who attempt this, all the will of good will perish, and that they will thus become merely corporeal-natural, for “flesh” signifies the will and its good or evil; “feet” signify the things of the natural man, therefore “to stand upon the feet” signifies to live from such things only; “his eyes shall waste away in their sockets” signifies that all"

[2] In respect to man’s self it is to be known that it is nothing but evil and falsity therefrom; the voluntary self (proprium voluntarium) is evil, and the intellectual self therefrom (proprium intellectuale) is falsity. This self man derives mainly from parents, grandfathers, and great-grandfathers, in a long series back, so that at length the hereditary, which is his self, is nothing but evil gradually heaped up and condensed. For every man is born into two diabolical loves, the love of self and the love of the world, from which loves all evils and all falsities therefrom pour forth as from their own fountains; and as man is born into these loves he is also born into evils of every kind (respecting which more may be seen in the New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine, n. 65–83). [3] Because man, in respect to his self is such, means have been given by the Divine mercy of the Lord, by which man can be withdrawn from his self; these means are given in the Word; and when man cooperates with these means, that is, when he thinks and speaks, wills and acts, from the Divine Word, he is kept by the Lord in things Divine, and is thus withheld from self; and when this continues there is formed with man by the Lord as it were a new self, both voluntary and intellectual, which is wholly separated from man’s self; thus man becomes as it were created anew, and this is what is called his reformation and regeneration by truths from the Word, and by a life according to them. (Respecting this see also the New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine, in the article on Remission of Sins, n. 159–172; and on Regeneration, n. 173–186.) To repent is to actually turn oneself away from evils, because every man is such as his life is, and the life of man consists mainly in willing and consequent doing; and from this it follows that repentance which is merely of the thought and of the lips, and not at the same time of the will and of action therefrom, is not repentance, for then the life remains the same afterwards as it was before. This makes evident that to repent is to actually turn oneself"

[4] That “the works of the hands” signify such things as man thinks, wills, and does from self, can be seen from the following passages in the Word. In Jeremiah: Provoke Me not to anger by the work of your hands, that I may not do evil to you; yet ye have not hearkened unto Me, that ye might provoke Me to anger by the work of your hands, for evil to you. Many nations and great kings shall make them to serve; that I may recompense them according to their work and according to the doing of their hands (25:6, 7, 14). “The work and doing of the hands” means in the nearest sense their molten images and idols; but in the spiritual sense the “work of the hands” signifies all the evil and falsity that are from self-love and self-intelligence. “Molten images and idols” which are called “the work of the hands” have a like signification, as will be seen in what follows, where the signification of “idols” is given. As man’s self is nothing but evil, thus is opposed to the Divine, it is said, “Provoke Me not to anger by the work of your hands, that I may not do evil to you”; “to provoke God to anger” signifies to be opposed to Him, which is the source of evil to man; and because all evils and falsities are from man’s self, it is said, “Many nations and great kings make them to serve,” which signifies that evils from which are falsities, and falsities from which are evils, will take possession of them; “many nations” meaning evils from which are falsities, and “great kings” falsities from which are evils. [5] In the same: The sons of Israel have provoked Me to anger by the work of their hands (Jer. 32:30). Ye provoke Me to anger by the works of your hands, burning incense unto other gods in the land of Egypt (44:8). “The works of their hands” mean here in the spiritual sense worship from falsities of doctrine which are from self-intelligence; such worship is signified by “burning incense to other gods in the"

Thus is this Word understood in heaven. [6] In the same: I will speak with them My judgments upon all their wickedness, that they have forsaken Me and have burned incense to other gods, and have bowed themselves down to the works of their own hands (Jer. 1:16). Here also “to burn incense to other gods” signifies worship from the falsities of doctrine, and “to bow themselves down to the works of their own hands” signifies worship from such things as are from self-intelligence; that this is from self and not from the Divine is signified by “that they have forsaken Me.” [7] In Isaiah: In that day shall a man look to his Maker, and his eyes shall see the Holy One of Israel, and he shall not look to the altars, the work of his hands, and he shall not see that which his fingers have made (17:7, 8). This is said of the Lord’s coming and of a new church at that time. “The Maker to whom a man shall then look” means the Lord in relation to Divine good, and “the Holy One of Israel whom his eyes shall see” means the Lord in relation to Divine truth. The “altars, which are the work of hands, and which the fingers have made, to which a man shall not look,” signify worship from evils and the consequent falsities of doctrine that are from self- intelligence. So these words mean that everything of doctrine will be from the Lord and not from man’s self, which is the case when man is in the spiritual affection of truth, that is, when he loves truth itself because it is truth, and not for the most part because it gives him reputation and a name.

This describes the establishment of the church; and the “idols of silver and the idols of gold, which in that day they shall reject” signify the falsities and evils of religion and of worship which they call truths and goods; and because the falsities and evils of religion and of worship are from self-intelligence it is said, “which your hands have made for you”; that there shall then be no reasonings from such things is signified by “then shall the Assyrian fall.” [10] In Jeremiah: Silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the workman and of the hands of the refiner; his46 garment is hyacinthine and purple; they are all the work of the wise (10:9).

This is why the altar, and also the temple, were built, by command, of whole stones, and not hewn by any workman or artificer. Respecting the altar it is thus said in Moses: If thou makest to Me an altar of stones thou shalt not build it of hewn stones, for if thou move a tool upon it thou wilt profane it (Exod. 20:25). And in Joshua: Joshua built an altar unto the God of Israel in Mount Ebal, an altar of whole stones, on which no one had moved iron (8:30, 31). And respecting the temple, in the first book of Kings: The temple at Jerusalem was built of stone, whole as it was brought; for there was neither hammer, nor axe, nor any tool of iron heard in the house while it was building (6:7). The altar, and afterwards the temple, were the chief representatives of the Lord in relation to Divine good and Divine truth, therefore “the stones of which they were built” signified the truths of doctrine, of religion and of worship; “stones” signifying in the Word truths. That nothing of self-intelligence must approach the truths of doctrine and thus worship, and consequently be in it, was represented by the stones of which the temple and the altar were built, being whole, and not hewn; for such is the signification of “the work of the workman and of the artificer”; “tool,” also “hammer” and “axe” and “iron,” in general, signify truth in its ultimate, and such truth is falsified chiefly by man’s self, for this truth is the same as the truth of the sense of the letter of the Word.

This is the signification of “the works of the hands” in the following passages. In David: The works of the hands of Jehovah are verity and judgment (Ps. 111:7). Jehovah will perfect for me; O Jehovah, Thy mercy is forever; neglect not the works of Thine own hands (Ps. 138:8). In Isaiah: Thy people shall be all righteous; they shall possess the land forever, the shoot of My plants, the work of My hands, that I may be glorified (60:21). O Jehovah, Thou art our Father; we are the clay and Thou our Potter; and we all are the work of Thy hands (64:8). Woe unto him that striveth with his Former! A potsherd with the potsherds of the earth! Shall the clay say to its potter, What makest thou? or thy work, Hath he no hands? Thus saith Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, and thy47 Former, They have asked Me signs respecting My sons, and respecting the work of My hands they command Me (45:9, 11). That here “Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, the Former,” means the Lord, is evident from what follows in verse 13; and “the work of His hands” means a man regenerated by Him, thus the man of the church. [13] In the same: Jehovah of Hosts shall bless, saying, Blessed be Egypt My people, and Assyria the work of My hands, and Israel Mine inheritance (Isa. 19:25). “Egypt” here signifies the natural, “Assyria” the rational, and “Israel” the spiritual; and “Assyria” is called “the work of Jehovah’s hands” because the rational is what is reformed in man, for it is the rational that receives truths and goods, and from this the natural;"

In Moses: Bless, O Jehovah, his strength, and accept the work of his hands (Deut. 33:11). This is said of Levi, who signifies the good of charity, and in the highest sense the Lord in respect to that good; reformation by means of it is meant by “the work of his hands.” 586. That they should not adore demons, signifies that they should not worship their own cupidities. This is evident from the signification of “to adore,” as being to worship, and from the signification of “demons,” as being evil cupidities. “Demons” are evil cupidities because by demons infernal spirits are meant, and all spirits that are in the hells are nothing but evil cupidities; for all spirits that are in the hells, as well as all angels in the heavens, are from the human race; and every man after death becomes such as his life has been in the world, consequently such as his affection has been; therefore after death man is wholly his affection, a good man the affection of good and truth, and an evil man the affection of evil and falsity. Moreover, every man after death thinks, wills, speaks, and acts in accordance with his affection. The affection of evil and falsity is what is called cupidity, and is what is signified by “demon.” [2] But what is meant by “worshiping demons” shall also be told briefly. Every man is associated with spirits; without association and conjunction with them no one can live; and the spirits with man are such as his affections or cupidities are; therefore when man in his worship does not look to the Lord or to the neighbor, but looks to himself and to the world, that is, when he worships God for the sole end of being carried to honors, and of gaining wealth, or of being able to do injury to others, then he worships demons; for then the Lord is not present in his worship, but infernal spirits are present, who are closely associated with him.

They sacrificed to demons that were not God, to gods that they knew not (Deut. 32:16, 17). The sons of Israel shall sacrifice at the entrance of the tent, and they shall no more sacrifice their sacrifices unto demons, after whom they go whoring (Lev. 17:7). The sacrifices that were offered at the entrance of the tent represented the worship of the Lord, because the altar, and also the tabernacle, represented heaven where the Lord is present; but the sacrifices that were offered elsewhere represented worship where the Lord is not present, thus the worship of demons; this was because all things at that time were representative. [4] In David: They sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto demons (Ps. 106:37). This was altogether infernal; but in the spiritual sense “to sacrifice sons and daughters” signified to pervert and destroy the truths and goods of the church by evil cupidities; “sons” signifying the truths of the church, and “daughters” its goods.

[6] So elsewhere in the same: The tziim shall sing48 there, and their houses shall be full of ochim, and the daughters of the owl shall dwell there, and the demons of the wood shall dance there (Isa. 13:21). This is said of Babylon; that there are such corporeal and purely natural lusts with those who are meant by Babylon, and that these constitute the life of their mind is signified by “their houses shall be full of such things,” and “they shall dwell and dance there.” “House” signifies the mind or disposition of man, with the things therein; “daughters of the owl” signify falsities, and “demons of the wood” (or satyrs) cupidities merely corporeal. Like things are said of Babylon in Revelation: Babylon is become a habitation of demons, and a hold of every unclean spirit, and a hold of every unclean and hateful bird (18:2). The demons cast out by the Lord, by which many were then obsessed, signify falsities of every kind by which the church was infested, and from which it was delivered by the Lord (as in Matt. 8:16, 28; 9:32, 33; 10:8; 12:22; 15:22; Mark 1:32–34; Luke 4:33–38, 41; 8:2, 26–40; 9:1, 37–44, 49, 50; 13:32; and elsewhere). 587a.

But what “idols of gold, of silver, of brass, of stone, and of wood,” signify in particular can be seen from the signification of “gold, silver, brass, stone, and wood”; “gold” signifies spiritual good, “silver” spiritual truth, “brass” natural good, “stone” natural truth, and “wood” sensual good.

When a false doctrinal is confirmed by the spiritual things of the Word it becomes an idol of gold and an idol of silver; but when it is confirmed by the natural things of the Word, such as belong to the sense of its letter, it becomes an idol of brass and stone; and when it is confirmed by the mere sense of the letter it becomes an idol of wood; for both the interior or spiritual and the exterior or natural senses of the Word can be applied to confirm falsities, as can be seen from innumerable heresies which are all confirmed thereby. [2] Falsities become confirmed when the genuine sense of the Word is not understood, and for the reason that self-loves and the principles derived therefrom are dominant, and when these are dominant man sees nothing from the light of heaven, but whatever he sees is from the light of the world separated from the light of heaven; and when the light of the world is separated from the light of heaven there is thick darkness in things spiritual. It is to be known that the sons of Israel took from Egypt and also from the nations round about the foul custom of worshiping idols; and as they were merely external men they also had that worship implanted in them from natural inclination, as can be seen from the idolatries of so many of the kings of Judah and Israel related in the Word, and also from Solomon himself who was the wisest of them; but still these idols which they made for themselves and worshiped, when they are mentioned in the Word, signify in the spiritual sense false doctrinals from self-intelligence, from which and according to which is worship. [3] This signification of idols, too, has its cause from the spiritual world; there evil spirits who have framed for themselves falsities of doctrine are seen fashioning idols and marking them in various ways until they appear to be in a human form; they also make selections from various representatives and fit them together so as to cohere, and thus counterfeit that form in externals.

Such an idol I have seen made by the English, by which they represented that faith alone is the essential of salvation, and that it produces the goods of charity without any cooperation from man. Idols are formed in the spiritual world by those who are in falsities of doctrine that are from self-intelligence, because Divine truths, from which is the genuine doctrine of the church, induce upon angels the human form; for this reason also angels signify in the Word Divine truths; and for this reason falsities of doctrine that are confirmed from the Word are presented as idols in the human form; truths of the Word that are falsified and that are used as confirmations induce that form, but because the truths are falsified an idol is presented that has no life. 587b. [4] That “idols, graven images, and molten images,” signify the falsities of doctrine, of religion, and of worship, can be seen from the following passages in the Word. In Isaiah: The artificer casteth a graven image, and the refiner spreadeth it over with gold and casteth chains of silver. He that is too impoverished for an oblation chooseth wood that will not rot; he seeketh unto him a wise artificer to prepare a graven image that shall not be moved (40:19, 20). This describes how doctrine is fused and welded together by means of falsities, thus by means of such things as are from self- intelligence, for these are all falsities. The “artificer,” the “refiner,” and the “wise artificer,” whom he seeketh unto him, mean one who fashions and forms such a doctrine. “To spread it over with gold” signifies that it may appear in the external form as good; “to cast chains of silver” signifies that falsities may fit together and appear as truths; “to choose wood that doth not rot, and to prepare a graven image that shall not be moved,” signifies that the doctrine may be acknowledged and not seem to be false. [5] In Jeremiah: Every man has become foolish by knowledge; every refiner is put to shame by the graven image; for his molten image is a lie, and there is no breath in them; they are vanity, and a work of errors; in the time of their visitation they shall perish (10:14, 15; 51:17, 18)."

This whole description of a “graven image” means the formation of doctrine from self-intelligence, and the particulars of the description signify the particulars of such formation. Why otherwise should there be in the Divine Word so extended a description of the mere formation of a graven image?

[10] From self-intelligence nothing but falsity comes, because man’s self is nothing but evil, for it favors his own love and his own intelligence; such, therefore, do not seek truths for the sake of truths, but only for the sake of reputation, renown, glory, and gain, and when these are dominant heaven cannot flow in with its light and open the sight and enlighten, consequently they see like owls, moles, and bats, in the dark, according to these words in Isaiah: In that day a man shall cast away the idols of his silver and the idols of his gold, which they made for themselves to bow down to the moles and to the bats (2:18, 20).

Here, too, “idols” stand for the falsities of doctrine which are from self-intelligence; to accept these falsities and to acknowledge them is signified by “making idols to ascend upon his heart”; and to be affected by them and live according to them is signified by “putting the stumbling block of iniquity before his faces”; that to such the Lord cannot reveal the genuine truths of doctrine so long as they are in these falsities is signified by “if he shall come to the prophet, shall I, Jehovah, answer him who cometh with a multitude of his idols?” A “prophet” means one who teaches truths, and in the abstract sense the doctrine of genuine truth which is from the Lord; and “a multitude of idols” signifies falsities in abundance, for from one falsity assumed as a principle, falsities flow forth in abundance, together with falsities in a series from their connection; this is why they are called “idols,” in the plural, and “a multitude of idols.” [14] In the same: I will sprinkle clean waters upon you that ye may be cleansed from all your uncleannesses, and from all your idols will I cleanse you (Ezek. 36:25).

[18] Because an external without an internal must not be worshiped, but only an external from an internal, thus the internal in the external, it was forbidden to make any graven image in the likeness of anything living on the earth, in Moses: Ye shall not make you a graven image, the shape of any similitude, the figure of male or female, the figure of any beast that is on the earth, the figure of any winged bird that flieth under heaven, the figure of anything that creepeth on the ground, the figure of any fish that is in the waters under the earth (Deut. 4:16–18; 5:8). This was prohibited because the Jewish nation, more than all other nations, was in externals without internals, and thus in the worship of all the external things that the nations called holy; and to worship external things other than those that represented heavenly things, which were the altar, the sacrifice upon it, the Tent of meeting, and the temple, was idolatrous. The Jewish worship of these, indeed, was also an idolatrous worship, but inasmuch as the church with them was a representative church their worship was accepted for the sake of the representation, although it did not affect them in respect to their soul, as can be seen from the various things shown respecting that nation in Arcana Coelestia (see what is collected in the New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine, n. 248). And as the worship of an external anywhere else than where it was commanded, which was beside the tent in the desert and beside the temple and in the temple in Jerusalem, was the worship of the representative itself without any intuition of the thing represented, thus a worship of what is merely earthly apart from anything heavenly, therefore this was forbidden them, even to the extent that they should not make for themselves any graven images of such things; for the nature of that nation was such that as soon as they saw them made they worshiped them.

From this it came that when those who were in external worship without any internal heard that the holy things of heaven and the church were signified by these objects, they began to worship them; as the Egyptians, and from them the sons of Israel in the wilderness and afterwards in Samaria, worshiped calves, because “calves” with the ancients signified the good affections of the natural man. 588. Which can neither see nor hear nor walk, signifies in which and from which there is nothing of the understanding of truth or the perception of good, and thus nothing of spiritual life. This is evident from the signification of “to see,” as being to understand truth (see above, n. 11, 260a, 529); also from the signification of “to hear,” as being to perceive and obey (see also above, n. 14, 249), and as being to have understanding to perceive (n. 529); also from the signification of “to walk,” as being to live spiritually, and in reference to the Lord that it is life itself (see above, n. 97). From this it is clear that “not to see, to hear, or to walk,” signifies that there is no understanding of truth, no perception of good, and thence no spiritual life; these are not in idols or from them, for “idols” signify the falsities of doctrine, of religion, and of worship, and such things are not in falsities, but in truths that are from good; in truths and from them is all understanding, all perception from the will of good, and consequently spiritual life. It is said “consequently,” because spiritual life consists in the understanding of truth and in perception from the will of good; for truths are in the light of heaven, and this so much that the truths themselves give light in heaven, and this because the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord makes all light in the spiritual world, and that light gives all intelligence and wisdom to angels. Now as truths themselves are of the light it follows that falsities are of no light, for they extinguish light, consequently falsities are called in the Word “darkness” (see above, n. 526); and as they are darkness, they are the shadow of spiritual death. But it is to be known that the falsities of evil constitute such darkness, not falsities that are not from evil. “To hear” signifies perception from the will"

That in the spiritual world sounds present and produce the affection which is of the will, and the words of the sound the thought which is of the understanding, may be seen in the work Heaven and Hell (n. 236, 241), and above (n. 323a). From this it can be seen why “to hear” and “to hearken” also signify to obey, and the “ear” and “hearing” obedience. 589. Verse 21. And repented not of their murders, signifies who have not actually turned themselves away from extinguishing the things that pertain to the understanding of truth, the will of good, and spiritual life therefrom. This is evident from the signification of “repenting,” as being actually turning oneself away (as above, n. 584a ); and from the signification of “murders,” as being the extinction of the understanding of truth, of the will of good, and of spiritual life therefrom; for “man” signifies the understanding of truth, and wisdom (see above, n. 280, 546, 547); and “to kill” signifies to extinguish spiritual life by the falsities of evil (see above, n. 315, 547, 572). That “murder or manslaughter” signifies the extinction of spiritual life can be seen without proof passages from the Word, from this, that the particulars here must be understood spiritually, and “to kill” spiritually is to extinguish spiritual life, which is done by the falsities of evil. [2] This is why the devil is called “a murderer from the beginning” by the Lord, in John: Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do.

This means the Jewish nation itself, which through its idolatries and traditions extinguished spiritual life by the falsities of evil; “the father thereof” means their fathers; because they extinguished spiritual life by the falsities of evils it is said, “there is no truth in him; when he speaketh a lie, he speaketh from his own, for he is a"

Because those who are meant by “Babylon” extinguish all Divine truths by the falsities of evil, Babylon is called: An abominable shoot, a garment of those that are slain, of those thrust through with the sword; for thou hast destroyed thy land, thou hast slain thy people (Isa. 14:19, 20).

Moreover, it is “repenting of murders, enchantments, and whoredoms” that is spoken of, and “murders” signify the extinction of the affection of good which is of the will, and of the perception of truth which is of the understanding (see above, n. 589); and the affection of good which is of the will is extinguished when the good of the Word is perverted, while the perception of truth which is of the understanding is extinguished"

Such enchantments the prophets also were skilled in and employed, and by them they excited good affections, hearkening, and obedience; and these enchantments are mentioned in a good sense in the Word in Isaiah 3:1–3, 20; 26:16; Jeremiah 8:17; and in David, Psalm 58:4–5. But as the evil excited evil affections by such utterances and mutterings, and thus enchantments became magical, they are also enumerated among the magical arts and severely forbidden (Deut. 18:9–11; Isa. 47:9, 12; Rev. 18:23; 22:15. Also in reference to Balaam and Jezebel). 591. Nor of their thefts, signifies nor from taking away the knowledges of truth and good, and thus the means of acquiring for themselves spiritual life. This is evident from the signification of “theft” and of “stealing,” as meaning to take away from anyone the knowledges of good and truth, which are to serve as means for acquiring for himself spiritual life (see above, n. 193). “Theft” and “stealing” have this meaning because “wealth,” “raiment,” “utensils,” and other things that thieves take away, signify the knowledges of truth and good; therefore spiritual theft, or theft in the spiritual sense, is the taking away of these, as natural theft, or theft in the natural sense, is the taking away of the former. That this is the signification of “theft” can be seen from this, that the extinction of spiritual life in others is what is particularly treated of in this verse, and spiritual life is extinguished by the perversions of good and the falsifications of truth, also by the deprivations of the knowledges of truth and good, by means of which spiritual life is acquired; and all of these are signified by “murders, enchantments, whoredoms, and thefts,” as has been shown already."

Verse 1. And I saw another strong angel coming down out of heaven, signifies the Lord as to the Word, here as to its ultimate sense, which is called the sense of the letter. This is evident from the signification of a “strong angel,” as being the Lord as to the Word (of which presently); it means as to the Word in its ultimate sense, which is called the sense of the letter, because it is from that sense that the Lord is called “strong,” for all the strength and all the power of Divine truth exist and consist in its ultimate, consequently in the sense of the letter of the Word (of which also presently). [2] Because it is the sense of the letter of the Word that is meant, therefore it is said that the angel was seen “coming down out of heaven.” The like is said of the Word, which is the Divine truth; this comes down from the Lord through the heavens into the world, consequently it is adapted to the wisdom of the angels who are in the three heavens, and is also adapted to men who are in the natural world. For this reason the Word in its first origin of all is wholly Divine, afterward celestial, then spiritual, and lastly natural; it is celestial for the angels of the inmost or third heaven, who are called celestial angels, it is spiritual for the angels of the second or middle heaven who are called spiritual angels, and it is celestial- natural and spiritual-natural for the angels of the ultimate or first heaven who are called celestial-natural and spiritual-natural angels, and it is natural for men in the world; for so long as men live in a material body they think and speak naturally.

These successive derivations of Divine truth proceeding from the Lord Himself exist by virtue of correspondences, established from creation itself, between things higher and lower, respecting which, the Lord willing, more will be said hereafter. [3] All strength and all power are in the ultimates of Divine truth, thus in the natural sense of the Word, which is the sense of the letter, because this sense is the container of all the interior senses, that is, of the spiritual and celestial (spoken of above); and as it is the container it is also the base, and in the base lies strength itself. For if higher things do not rest upon their base they fall and are scattered. So would it be if the spiritual and celestial things of the Word did not rest upon its natural or literal sense, for this not only sustains the interior senses, but also contains them, consequently the Word or Divine truth is not only in its power, but also in its fullness in this sense. (But on this subject more may be seen above; namely, that strength is in the ultimate, because the Divine is there in its fullness, n. 346, 567. That interior things flow in successively into exteriors, even into the most external or ultimate, and that they coexist there, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 634, 6239, 6465, 9215, 9216; that they not only flow in successively, but also form in their ultimate what is simultaneous, in what order, n. 5897, 6451, 8603, 10099. That therefore there is strength and power in ultimates, n. 9836; that therefore responses and revelations were given in ultimates, n. 9905, 10548; that therefore the ultimate is more holy than the interiors, n. 9824.) From this, too, it follows that everything of doctrine of the church ought to be formed and confirmed from the literal sense of the Word, and that also doctrine has its power from that (see above, n. 356). This is why the “angel coming down out of heaven” is said to be “strong.”"

This signification of “cloud” is evident from appearances in the spiritual world; also from the Word wherever “clouds” are mentioned. From appearances in the spiritual world, as follows: the universal angelic heaven consists solely of the Divine truth that proceeds from the Lord; the reception of this constitutes angels.

There is a like appearance when angels of the higher heavens speak about Divine truths; what they say is then presented to the view of those who are in the lowest heaven under the appearance of a cloud that floats hither and thither; the more intelligent of them know from its movement and brightness and form what the angels of the higher heavens are speaking about with each other. This makes evident why a “cloud” signifies Divine truth in ultimates. As most things in the Word were taken from the appearances in the spiritual world, and thence have a like significance as they have there, so is it with “clouds.”"

In the Gospels: Jesus took Peter, James, and John into a high mountain; and He was transfigured before them; and His face did shine as the sun, and His garments became as the light. And behold, there appeared Moses and Elijah speaking with Him. While Peter was yet speaking, behold a bright cloud overshadowed them; and behold a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is My beloved Son, hear ye Him (Matt. 17:1–10; Mark 9:1–11). And in Luke: While Peter thus spake there came a cloud and overshadowed them; hence they feared as they entered into the cloud. But there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is My beloved Son; hear ye Him (9:34, 35). In this transfiguration the Lord represented Divine truth, which is the Word; for the Lord, when He was in the world, made His Human Divine truth, and when He went out of the world He made His Human Divine good by uniting it with the Divine Itself, that was in Him from conception. (That the Lord made His Human Divine truth when He was in the world, and afterwards Divine good, may be seen in the New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine, n. 303–306; and that the Lord is the Word, n. 263.) Consequently the particular things that were seen when He was transfigured signify the proceeding of Divine truth from the Lord’s Divine good. The Divine good of Divine love which was in Him, and from which He had Divine truth in His Human, was represented by “His face did shine as the sun”; for the “face” represents the interiors, since these shine forth through the face; and the “sun” signifies the Divine love (see above, n. 401b, 412b). The Divine truth was represented by the “garments” which became as the light; “garments” in the Word signify truths, and “the Lord’s garments” Divine truth (see also above, n. 64, 271, 395d); this is why they appeared “as the light”; for Divine truth makes the light in the angelic heaven, and is therefore signified by “light” in the Word (respecting which see in the work Heaven and Hell, n. 126–140).

From this it can now be seen that the manifestation here predicted signifies His manifestation in the Word; and His manifestation in the Word was effected through His opening and revealing the internal or spiritual sense of the Word, for in that sense is the Divine truth itself, such as it is in heaven, and the Divine truth in heaven is the Lord Himself there. This makes clear that “the Lord’s coming in the clouds of heaven with glory” signifies the revelation of Him in the sense of the letter of the Word from its spiritual sense. “The clouds of heaven” signify the things belonging to the sense of the letter, and “glory” signifies those belonging to the spiritual sense (see in the work Heaven and Hell, n. 1), also the revelation itself of the spiritual sense (in the small work on the White Horse); “Son of man” also signifies the Lord in relation to Divine truth (as may be seen above, n. 63, 151). [4] That a “cloud” signifies Divine truth in ultimates, consequently the Word in the sense of the letter, can be seen further from the following passages. In Isaiah: Behold, Jehovah rideth upon a light cloud, and cometh into Egypt, and the idols of Egypt are moved before Him, and the heart of the Egyptian melteth in the midst of him (19:1). “Egypt” here does not mean Egypt, but the natural man when separated from the spiritual, which is then in falsities and evils, and through these perverts all the truths and goods of the church; that the natural man is destroyed by these falsities and evils when truth from good flows in from the Lord is described by these words of the prophet understood in the internal sense. Jehovah is said “to ride upon a light cloud” to signify that the Lord enlightens the understanding with truths; “to ride” in reference to Jehovah or the Lord, signifying to enlighten the understanding, and “a light cloud” signifying truth; that then “the idols of Egypt are moved, and the heart of the Egyptian melteth,” signifies that the evils and falsities of the natural man, separated from the spiritual, then destroy the natural man; “idols” meaning falsities, the “heart” evils, and “Egypt” the natural man."

Here, too, “riding in heaven upon the clouds” signifies to enlighten the understanding by the influx of spiritual truth into natural truth, which is the truth of the sense of the letter of the Word. Because Divine truth in the heavens is spiritual, and Divine truth on the earth is natural, and the latter is enlightened by the former, therefore it is said, “and in His magnificence upon the clouds”; “the abode of the God of antiquity” means Divine truth with the angels, and “the arms of the world,” mean Divine truths with men; the truths of the sense of the letter of the Word are what are meant by “the arms of the world,” for that sense is the very strength of Divine truth, “arms” signifying strength. (That the strength of Divine truth is in the sense of the letter can be seen in the article just above.) [6] In David: God rode upon a cherub and did fly, and was borne upon the wings of the wind.

Truth in ultimates, which is the truth of the sense of the letter of the Word, is called “clouds, the dust of the feet of Jehovah,” because it is the natural and lowest truth, into which Divine truth in heaven, which is spiritual, closes, and upon which it subsists. Divine truth in ultimates, because it is but little understood unless there is enlightenment from heaven, is a subject of discussion and controversy, and this is meant by “storm and tempest in which Jehovah hath His way,” spiritual “storm and tempest” meaning discussion concerning the genuine sense, which nevertheless, with those who desire truth, the Lord enlightens by means of influx. [9] In David: His seed shall be to eternity, and His throne as the sun before Thee.1 It shall be established as the moon to eternity, and as a faithful witness in the clouds (Ps. 89:36, 37).

The “cherubim” signify the Lord in respect to guarding, that there be no approach except through the good of love; so, too, the “cherubim” signify the heavens, in particular the inmost or third heaven, because the angels who are there receive Divine truth in the good of love, therefore it is Divine truth, which is in its essence the good of love, that guards. This Divine truth, as it comes down out of the inmost heaven into the lower heavens, and at length into the world where men are, from being pure becomes thus by degrees more dense, consequently in the lowest degree it appears like a cloud; this is why it signifies Divine truth accommodated to the apprehension of the angels who are in the lowest heaven, who are spiritual-natural, and finally to the apprehension of men in the natural world. Moreover, as Divine truth in this degree is similar to the Divine truth in the sense of the letter of the Word, “cloud” signifies the Word as to the sense of the letter. It was this Divine truth that filled the court like a cloud, and at length the house, at the right side of which stood the cherubim; and as this Divine truth is inwardly the spiritual that shines from heavenly light, therefore it is called “glory,” and it is said that “the court was full of the brightness of Jehovah’s glory.” Also in Job: When God maketh the light of His cloud to be bright (37:15). [18] Because the higher heavens appear before the eyes of those who are in the lower heavens as covered by a light and bright cloud (for the reason that the lower angels are unable to see the higher or interior Divine otherwise than in accordance with their own quality), therefore also Divine truth in the higher heavens, or what is the same thing, the higher heavens themselves, are meant in some passages in the Word by “clouds”; for whether you say Divine truth or the heavens it is the same, since the heavens are heavens from Divine truth, and the angels there are angels from the reception of Divine truth.

And the rainbow above his head, signifies the interior things of the Word. This is evident from the signification of the “rainbow,” as being Divine truth such as the Word is in the spiritual sense (of which presently); and from the signification of “above the head,” as being what is interior; for “above” and “higher” signify within and interior, as can be seen from this, that in heaven when interior is said higher is meant; for the heavens of the angels who are interior or interiorly wise appear also above the heavens of the angels who are more external or externally wise. For this reason the three heavens are distinguished from one another by their height, the inmost or third heaven appearing above the middle or second heaven, and this above the ultimate or first. [2] “Higher” signifies interior, because when higher and lower things are together, that is, form what is simultaneous, as in the head of man, they exist together in such an order that those things that had in successive order existed above are placed within, and those that had in successive order existed below are placed without. This is why higher things signify interior things, and lower things signify exterior things. This may be illustrated to the comprehension by the idea of a surface, in the center of which are things purer, and in the circumferences things grosser; things higher and lower form such a surface when they are let down into one and make what is simultaneous. From this it can also be seen, what is signified by the “angel,” spoken of just above, “encompassed with a cloud,” since for the same reason and from the same idea, “to be encompassed” means by what is without and below."

But the rainbows that appear in the angelic heaven differ from the rainbows that appear in the world, in that the rainbows of heaven are from a spiritual origin, while the rainbows of the world are from a natural origin; for the rainbows of heaven are from the light that arises from the Lord as a sun, and as that sun is in its essence the Lord’s Divine love, and the light therefrom is Divine truth, the variegations of light which are presented as rainbows are variegations of intelligence and wisdom with the angels. From this it is that rainbows there signify the form and beauty of spiritual Divine truth. But the rainbows of the world are from a natural origin, namely, from the sun of the world and its light; therefore they are merely modifications and consequent variegations of light by waters that fall from a cloud. And because there are like appearances of color in the spiritual world as in the natural world, and because these correspond, therefore the rainbows of the world have a similar signification as the rainbows of heaven, namely, spiritual Divine truths in their form and beauty; these truths are such as those of the Word in the spiritual sense.

This makes evident also that the translucence of spiritual Divine truth through natural Divine truth is what produces that appearance in the heavens, and consequently that is what it signifies (as was said above; but this can be more clearly understood from what is said on Heaven in the work Heaven and Hell; that from the Lord’s Divine Human it represents One Man, n. 59–86; on the Correspondence of all Things of Heaven with all Things of Man, n. 87–102; and in Arcana Coelestia, on the correspondence of the loins, n. 3021, 4280, 4462, 5050–5062).

For this reason, in consequence of the correspondence between spiritual and natural things, such rainbows as are seen from the earth by men mean such rainbows as are seen by angels in the spiritual world, all of which arise from the light of heaven and its modification in the spiritual- natural sphere there, and thus from spiritual Divine truth, and its translucence in natural Divine truth; for all light in heaven is spiritual, and in its essence is the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord. From this it can be seen that “the bow in the cloud or rainbow” signifies spiritual Divine truth translucent through natural Divine truth, and there is such a translucence with those who are being reformed and regenerated by the Lord by means of Divine truth and a life according to it. In the heavens also this very translucence appears as a rainbow. “The sign of a covenant” signifies the Lord’s presence and conjunction with such, for “covenant” signifies conjunction. This sign was given because the “flood,” by which the human race was then destroyed, signifies the direful falsities of evil, from which the posterity of the most ancient church perished. The restoration and the establishment of a new church, called the ancient church, by Divine truth conjoined to spiritual good, which in its essence is charity, are what rainbows representatively manifest in heaven and thence signify in the world. (But as these words involve more arcana than can be explained briefly, see for a detailed explanation of them Arcana Coelestia, n. 1031–1059.) 596. And his face as the sun, signifies the Lord’s Divine love, from which is all Divine truth, which in heaven and in the church is the Word. This is evident from the signification of “face,” as being in reference to the Lord the Divine love, the Divine mercy, and every good (of which above, n. 74, 412a–e); and from the signification of"

And his feet as pillars of fire, signifies Divine truth, or the Word in ultimates, which is natural, sustaining interior things there, and full of the good of love. This is evident from the signification of “feet,” as being in reference to the Lord the Divine good of natural Divine love, which is the ultimate in Divine order (see above, n. 65, 69); from the signification of “pillars,” as being lower truths which sustain the higher (see above, n. 219); and from the signification of “fire,” as being in reference to the Lord the Divine love (see also above, n. 68, 496, 504a–d ). From this it can be seen that “the feet of the angel seen as pillars of fire” signify Divine truth or the Word in ultimates, which, as the natural sustaining interior things, is full of the good of love. Divine truth in ultimates means the Word in the sense of the letter; and because this sense is natural, and the natural is the ultimate of Divine order, therefore this is what sustains spiritual and celestial Divine truth, exactly as pillars sustain a house or feet sustain the body; for without the natural sense of the Word its interiors, which are spiritual and celestial, would fall apart, like a house when its pillars are removed. Each and all things, therefore, that are in the natural or ultimate sense of the Word are perpetual correspondences, that is, they correspond to the spiritual and celestial things that are in the heavens, and thus also they signify them. From this it can in some measure be seen how natural Divine truth, which is the Word in the world, sustains spiritual and celestial Divine truth, which is Divine truth in heaven, as pillars sustain a house. This makes clear also why the feet of the angel were seen as “pillars of fire.”"

This is the first and great commandment. The second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. On these two commandments hang the whole law and the prophets (Matt. 22:37–40). “The law and the prophets” mean the Word in all things and in every particular; consequently these words mean that each and all things in the Word hang upon the good of love to the Lord, and the good of charity toward the neighbor. 598. Verses 2–4. And he had in his hand a little book opened, and he set his right foot upon the sea, and the left upon the earth.

And when the seven thunders had spoken their voices I was about to write; and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Seal up the things which the seven thunders spake, and write them not. 2. “And he had in his hand a little book opened,” signifies the Word laid open (n. 599); “and he set his right foot upon the sea, and the left upon the earth,” signifies the sense of the letter, which is natural, in which are all things of heaven and the church (n. 600). 3. “And he cried out with a great voice, as a lion roareth,” signifies the testification of grievous distress on account of the desolation of Divine truth in the church (n. 601); “and when he cried out the seven thunders spake their voices,” signifies instruction from heaven, and perception respecting the last state of the church (n. 602). 4. “And when the seven thunders had spoken their voices I was about to write,” signifies that he wished to disclose that state (n. 603); “and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Seal up the things which the seven thunders spake, and write them not,” signifies command by the Lord that these things should be reserved, and not yet be disclosed (n. 604). 599.

And he set his right foot upon the sea, and the left upon the earth, signifies the sense of the letter, which is natural, in which are all things of heaven and the church. This is evident from the signification of “feet,” as being in reference to the angel, by whom is meant the Lord in relation to the Word, the Divine truth in ultimates, or the Word in the natural sense, which is the sense of the letter (see above, n. 65, 69). “Feet” in a general sense signify natural things, because man from the head to the soles of the feet corresponds to heaven, which in its whole complex represents one man, the head corresponding to the inmost or third heaven, the angels of which are celestial, the breast down to the loins corresponding to the middle or second heaven, the angels of which are called spiritual, and the feet corresponding to the ultimate or first heaven, the angels of which are celestial-natural and spiritual- natural; and the soles of the feet corresponding to the world, in which everything is natural. This makes clear why the “feet” signify natural things (see more on this correspondence in the work Heaven and Hell, n. 59–86, and 87–102). [2] From this it is now evident why “the feet of the angel,” who here represented the Lord as to the Word, signify the natural sense of the Word, which is the sense of its letter. The above is evident also from the signification of “the right foot upon the sea and the left upon the earth,” as being all things of heaven and the church; for the “right”4 signifies all things of good which is the source of truth, and the “left” all things of truth from good; and “the sea and the earth” signify all things of heaven and the church exterior and interior, the “sea” exterior things, and the “earth” interior things. And as all things of heaven and the church have relation to good and truth, also to things exterior and things interior, therefore these words signify in general all things of heaven and the church.

This shows why “sea and earth” signify all things of heaven and also of the church. [3] As “right and left” are mentioned in many passages in the Word, and in some places “right” alone, or “left” alone, I will explain in a few words what is signified by each of them, and by the two together. This can be known from the quarters in the spiritual world, where the south is to the right, and the north to the left, and the east in front, and the west behind. An angel perpetually faces the Lord as a sun, therefore before him is the Lord as the east, and behind him the Lord as the west, and at his right hand is the south, and at his left hand the north. It is from this way of facing that the “right” signifies truth in light, and the “left” truth in shade; or what is the same, that the “right” signifies spiritual good which is truth in light, and the “left” signifies spiritual truth which is truth in shade; so, too, the “right” signifies good which is a source of truth, and the “left” truth from good. Such is the signification of all the right and left parts of the body, and also of the head; as the right and left eye, the right and left hand, the right and left foot, and so on, the proper signification of each member or part being preserved. From these few statements it can be known what “right” and “left” signify, in general and in particular, in the Word of both the New and the Old Testaments, as in the following passages. [4] In Matthew: When thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what the right hand doeth, that thine alms may be in secret (Matt. 6:3, 4). This signifies that good is to be done from good and for the sake of good, and not on account of self and the world for the sake of appearance; “alms” mean every good work; and “let not the left hand know what the right hand doeth” signifies that good must be done from good itself, and not without good, since that would not be good. The “right hand” signifies good which is a source of truth, and the “left hand” truth from good, as has been said above; these"

[5] In the same: And the King shall set the sheep on His right hand, but the goats on the left; and He shall say unto them on His right hand, Come, ye blessed of My Father, possess as inheritance the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. And He shall say unto them on the left hand, Depart from Me, ye cursed, into the eternal fire, prepared for the devil and his angels (Matt. 25:33, 34, 41). He who does not know what is signified in the proper sense by “sheep” and what by “goats,” might suppose that “sheep” mean all who are good, and “goats” all who are evil; but in the proper sense “sheep” mean those who are in the good of charity towards the neighbor, and thence in faith, and “goats” mean those who are in faith separated from charity; thus all upon whom the judgment in the last time of the church will come; for all who were in the good of love to the Lord, and thence in the good of charity and faith, had been taken up into heaven before the Last Judgment; while all who were in no good of charity, and in no faith therefrom, consequently all who were inwardly and at the same time outwardly evil, had been cast down into hell before the Last Judgment; but those who were inwardly good and not equally so outwardly, also those who were inwardly evil but outwardly in good, were all left until the Last Judgment, when those who were inwardly good were taken up into heaven, and those who were inwardly evil were cast into hell (respecting this see what has been said from things seen and heard, in the little work on the Last Judgment). From this it can be seen that “goats” mean those who have been in faith separated from charity; as for instance: The he-goat in Daniel (8:5–25), and in Ezekiel (34:17). This makes evident that the “right hand,” where the “sheep” are, means the good of charity and of faith therefrom, and the “left"

It was said to the sheep that they should “possess as inheritance the kingdom prepared for them from the foundation of the world,” because in the heavens at the right is the south, where all those are who are in truths from good; for in the southern part the Divine proceeding itself is such as is meant by “the kingdom prepared from the foundation of the world.” So, too, they are called “the blessed of My Father,” the “Father” meaning the Divine good, from which are all things of heaven. But respecting the “goats,” that are on the left hand, it is not said “prepared from the foundation of the world,” but “the eternal fire, prepared for the devil and his angels,” because the evil prepare their hell for themselves. They are called “cursed” because by the “cursed” in the Word are meant all who turn themselves away from the Lord, for such reject the charity and faith of the church. What the “eternal fire” signifies may be seen in the work Heaven and Hell (n. 566–575). [6] The “two robbers who were crucified one of them on the right hand and the other on the left hand of the Lord” (Matt. 27:38; Mark 15:27; Luke 23:39–43), have a similar signification as the “sheep” and the “goats”; therefore to the one who acknowledged the Lord it was said that he should be with Him in paradise. [7] In John: Jesus said to the disciples who were fishing, Cast the net on the right side of the boat, then ye shall find. They cast, therefore, and they were no longer able to draw it for the multitude of fishes (21:6). Since “fishing” signifies in the Word the instruction and conversion of men who are in external or natural good, in which good were most of the Gentiles at that time, “fish” signifying the things of the natural man, and “boat” doctrine from the Word; therefore “the right side of the boat” signifies the good of life. This makes clear the signification of what the Lord said, “Cast the net on the right side of the boat,” namely, that they should teach the good of life. That they would thus convert the Gentiles to the church is signified by their finding in such abundance that “they were not"

[8] In Matthew: If thy right eye hath caused thee to stumble, pluck it out and cast it from thee. And if thy right hand hath caused thee to stumble, cut it off and cast it from thee (5:29, 30). That by the “right eye” and the “right hand” the Lord did not mean the right eye and the right hand, anyone can see from its being said that the eye “must be plucked out” and the hand “must be cut off” if they cause to stumble; but as the “eye” signifies in the spiritual sense everything belonging to the understanding and to thought therefrom, and the “right hand” everything belonging to the will and to affection therefrom, it is evident that “if the right eye hath caused thee to stumble it must be plucked out” signifies that if one thinks evil the evil must be rejected from the thought; also “if the right hand hath caused thee to stumble it must be cut off” signifies that if evil is willed the evil of the will must be cast out. For the eye itself cannot cause to stumble, nor can the right hand, but the thought of the understanding and the affection of the will, to which they correspond, can. It is said the “right eye” and the “right hand,” and not the left eye and the left hand, because the “right” signifies good, and in the contrary sense evil, while the “left” hand signifies truth, and in the contrary sense falsity, and all cause of stumbling comes from evil, not from falsity, unless the falsity is the falsity of evil. That these things are said of the internal man, whose part it is to think and to will, and not of the external, whose part it is to see and to act, is evident also from the words that immediately precede respecting the “woman of another,” that merely looking upon her from lust is committing adultery. 600b.

The Divine itself proceeding from the Lord as a sun produces such a Divine sphere in those quarters; for this reason none can possibly dwell there except those who are in those truths from good; this is the signification of “to sit on the right hand and on the left hand of the Lord is for those only to whom it has been given, or for whom it has been prepared by the Father”; “the Father” meaning the Divine good of the Divine love, from which is heaven and everything of heaven; so these words of the Lord mean that to sit on His right hand and on His left in the heavens is given by the Lord to those for whom it has been prepared from the foundation of the world to have an inheritance allotted to them in the south and in the north. [10] That the “right hand” means the south in the heavens is clearly evident in David: The heavens are Thine, and the earth is Thine; the world and the fullness thereof, Thou hast founded them; the north and the right hand Thou hast created (Ps. 89:11, 12). “Heaven and earth” means the higher and lower heavens, likewise the internal and external church; the “world and the fullness thereof” means the heavens and the church in general as to good and truth; the “world” heaven and the church as to good, and the “fullness thereof” heaven and the church as to truth; and as these principles, or those who are in them, are in the north and in the south, and the south is at the Lord’s right hand, it is said “the north and the right hand”; and as Divine truth united to Divine good in those quarters is such from the foundation of the world, as has been"

This treats of those who are in temptations, and who, by means of temptations and after temptations, accept and receive instruction in the truths of doctrine; temptations themselves are signified by “the bread of distress and the waters of oppression,” “bread of distress” signifying temptations in respect to the good of love, and “waters of oppression” temptations in respect to the truths of faith; for temptations are of two kinds, namely, in respect to the good which is of love, and in respect to the truth which is of faith; “bread” signifying the good of love, and “waters” the truths of faith, and “distress” and “oppression” states of temptation. Instruction in the truths of doctrine is signified by “thine eyes shall look again to thine instructors,” “eyes” signifying the understanding and faith, and “instructors” doctrine. The good of life according to the truths of doctrine is signified by “thine ears shall hear the word,” “ears” signifying obedience, and because obedience is of the life, so “to hear the word” signifies a life according to the truths of doctrine. Instruction and obedience are further described by “saying, This is the way, walk ye in it, when ye shall go to the right hand and when ye shall go to the left”; “way” signifies truth leading, truth leading to the south in heaven is meant by “going to the right,” and truth leading to the north there by “going to the left.” [12] In the same: Enlarge the place of thy tent, and let them stretch forth the curtains of thy habitations; hinder not; make long thy cords, and make firm thy stakes; for on the right hand and on the left thou shalt break forth; and thy seed shall inherit the nations, and make the desolate cities to be inhabited (Isa. 54:2, 3)."

(The rest may be seen explained above, n. 386b.)

Here “the tip of the right ear,” “the thumb of the right hand,” and “the great toe of the right foot,” have a similar signification as above; so has the “blood,” namely, Divine truth, for this is what purifies man from the falsities that have consumed the goods in him; and when he is purified from these, good can be produced by means of truths, and the man be thus healed of leprosy. From all this it can be seen that “the right and the left” signify the good from which is truth and the truth that is from good (as has been said above). For what other purpose would the blood have been put upon the right part of those members, and the oil be taken from the left palm, and sprinkled with the left finger? [20] Likewise: The prophet Ezekiel was commanded to lie upon his left side, and to have laid upon him the iniquities of the house of Israel (Ezek. 4:4). For a “prophet” signifies one who teaches, and in an abstract sense the doctrine of the church; the “left side” signifies the doctrine of truth from good, and it is through truths from good that man is purified from his iniquities."

Thus these “ten lavers” signified all things of purification and all who are purified, and “the five on one shoulder and the five on the other” signified those, or that kind of men, with whom Divine truth is in the light and with whom it is in the shade; “ten” signifying all things and all persons, and “five” one part or one kind. The brazen sea represented general purifying. This was placed by “the right shoulder of the house eastward from the region of the south,” because purifying Divine truth proceeds from the Lord’s Divine love; for the east is where the Lord appears as a sun; Divine truth, which is the light of heaven from that sun, in the south is in its clearness and sunshine; this is why the general purificator was placed “eastward from the region of the south.” These arcana of the Word cannot be known in the world until the quarters in heaven are understood, which differ from the quarters in the world. (Respecting the quarters in heaven, see what has been said, from things seen and heard, in the work Heaven and Hell, n. 141–153.) [22] Since everyone in the spiritual world enters and walks in ways that lead to those who are in a like ruling love, and everyone is free to go any way he wishes, thus into and by any way that his love leads him, and these ways to the right or to the left tend to one love or another, thus to the love that has become ingrafted, so “right and left” signifies pleasantly, freely, and of choice. Thus in the book of Genesis: Abraham said to Lot, Separate thyself; if to the left I will go to the right, if to the right I will go to the left (13:9)."

Not to recede or to turn to the right hand or to the left, signifies also to go in no other way than that in which the Lord Himself leads, and in which the good and truth of heaven and the church lead, thus not to go astray, as: That they should not turn aside from the word of the priest, the Levite, and of the judge, nor from the precepts in the Word, to the right hand or to the left (Deut. 17:11, 20; 28:14; Josh. 1:7; 2 Sam. 14:19). And that the sons of Israel should not turn aside to the right hand or to the left, but should go by the king’s highway when they passed through the land of Edom (Num. 20:17). And when they passed through the land of King Sihon (Deut. 2:27). Moreover, “the right hand” signifies full power, and in relation to the Lord, Divine omnipotence (as may be seen above, n. 298a, b ). 601a. Verse 3. And cried out with a great voice, as a lion roareth, signifies the testification of grievous distress on account of the desolation of Divine truth in the church. This is evident from the signification of “crying out with a great voice,” as being the testification of grievous distress (of which presently); and from the signification of “as a lion roareth,” as being on account of the desolation of Divine truth in the church; for a “lion” signifies Divine truth in its power (see above, n. 278), and “to roar” signifies the result of distress because of the desolation of truth. [2] That this is the signification of “crying out with a great voice, as a lion roareth,” can be seen from what follows in this chapter, where the desolation of Divine truth in the church is treated of; for “a strong angel coming down out of heaven” means the Lord in relation to the Word, which is Divine truth, of whom it is said afterwards that “the angel lifted up his hand to heaven, and sware"

[3] And afterwards it is said, “In the days of the voice of the seventh angel the mystery of God shall be finished,” which signifies the Last Judgment that was to come when there should be no faith in Divine truth because there would be no good of charity. From this it can be seen that “He cried out with a great voice, as a lion roareth,” signifies the testification of grievous distress on account of the desolation of Divine truth in the church. [4] Moreover, a “lion” is often mentioned in the Word; and in the highest sense a “lion” signifies the Lord in relation to Divine truth, likewise heaven and the church in respect to Divine truth from the Lord; and from this a “lion” signifies Divine truth in respect to power (see above, n. 278). This makes evident what “to roar” or “the roaring of a lion” signifies, namely, an ardent affection for defending heaven and the church, and thus for saving the angels of heaven and the men of the church, which is done by destroying the falsities of evil by means of Divine truth and its power; but in the contrary sense “to roar” or “the roaring of a lion” signifies an ardent desire to destroy and devastate the church, which is done by destroying Divine truth by means of the falsities of evil. Such is the signification of a “lion’s roaring,” because when a lion is hungry and seeks its prey, and also when it is enraged with anger against its enemy, it is its habit to roar. [5] That this is the signification of “to roar” and “roaring” in the Word can be seen from the following passages. In Isaiah: Thus Jehovah said unto me, Like as the lion, and the young lion roareth over his prey, when a multitude of shepherds goeth out against him, and he is not dismayed at their voice nor affected by their tumult, so shall Jehovah of Hosts come down to wage war upon Mount Zion and upon the hill thereof (31:4). Jehovah is compared to a lion roaring, because a “lion” signifies the Lord in relation to Divine truth and its power, and “to roar” signifies the eagerness to defend the church against evils and"

[6] In Joel: Jehovah shall roar out of Zion, and shall give forth His voice from Jerusalem, and the heavens and the earth shall quake; but Jehovah shall be a shelter for His people, and a stronghold for the sons of Israel (3:16). The protection of the faithful by the Lord by means of Divine truth is described by “Jehovah shall roar out of Zion, and shall give forth His voice from Jerusalem”; the vehement power of Divine truth, and consequent terror, are described by “the heavens and the earth shall quake”; and salvation and protection by “Jehovah shall be a shelter for His people, and a stronghold for the sons of Israel”; “the people of Jehovah” and “the sons of Israel” being the faithful who are of the church. [7] In Hosea: I will not return to destroy Ephraim. They shall go after Jehovah; He shall roar like a lion, for He shall roar, and sons from the sea shall draw near with honor, with honor shall they come as the bird out of Egypt and as the dove out of the land of Assyria; and I will make them to dwell upon their houses (11:9–11). “Ephraim” signifies the church in respect to the understanding of truth, concerning which therefore what follows is said. “To go after Jehovah” signifies to worship the Lord and to live from Him; “He shall roar like a lion, for He shall roar,” signifies the protection of such by the Divine truth; “the sons from the sea shall draw near with honor,” signifies that those who are in natural good shall draw near to the church; “with honor shall they come as a bird out of Egypt,” signifies their natural thought from true knowledges (scientifica); the “bird” meaning thought, and “Egypt” knowledge, which is natural truth; “and as the dove out of the land of Assyria,” signifies that they shall have rational good and truth, a “dove”"

[8] In Amos: The Lord Jehovih will not do7 a word unless He shall reveal His secret unto His servants the prophets. The lion hath roared, who will not fear? The Lord Jehovih hath spoken, who will not prophesy? (3:7, 8). “The Lord Jehovih will not do a word unless He hath revealed His secret to His servants the prophets” signifies that the Lord opens the interior things of the Word and of doctrine to those who are in truths from good; “to reveal a secret,” signifies to enlighten and to open the interior things of the Word; “His servants the prophets” signify those who are in the truths of doctrine and who receive; “the lion hath roared, who will not fear?” signifies a powerful revelation and manifestation of Divine truth; “the Lord Jehovih hath spoken, who will not prophesy?” signifies its reception and manifestation.

Those are called “lions” who are in Divine truths; “roaring” signifies grief; “the pride of Jordan, which is devastated,” signifies the church in respect to Divine truth which introduces. [10] In Job: God roareth with His voice; He thundereth with the voice of His majesty; nor yet doth He overthrow when His voice is heard; God thundereth marvelously with His voice (37:4, 5). “To roar” and “to thunder with the voice” signify the power and efficacy of Divine truth or the Word. 601b. [11] In the passages that have been cited, “to roar” signifies in a broad sense the ardent affection of protecting heaven and the church, or the angels of heaven and the men of the church, which is done by destroying the falsities of evil by means of Divine truth and its power. But in the contrary sense, “to roar” signifies an eager cupidity for ruining and destroying the church, which is done by destroying Divine truth by means of the falsities of evil. In this sense “to roar” is used in the following passages. In Jeremiah: Babylon shall become heaps, the abode of dragons, an astonishment, and a hissing. They shall roar together like lions; they shall growl like lions’ whelps; when they are heated I will set8 their feasts, and I will make them drunken that they may exult and may sleep the sleep of an age and not awake (51:37–39). The destruction of Babylon so that there may be in it no truth or good, is signified by “Babylon shall become heaps, the abode of dragons, an astonishment, and a hissing.” “Babylon” signifies those who abuse holy things for the sake of dominion; their eager cupidity for destroying Divine truth by means of the falsities of evil is signified by “they shall roar together like lions, they shall growl like lions’ whelps.” The eagerness of those who unite in doing this crime is signified by “when they are heated I will set their feasts”; that such will become insane from the falsities of evil is signified by “I will make them drunken that they may exult.” That they will"

The young lions roar against him, they give forth their voice, they reduce his land to a waste; his cities are burned, even so that there is no inhabitant (Jer. 2:14, 15). “Is Israel a servant? Is he one born of the house?” signifies the church that had been in truths and goods, but is so no longer. “Israel” signifies the church; a “servant” those who are in truths, and “one born of the house,” those who are in goods; “why has he become a prey?” signifies its devastation; “the young lions roar against him, they give forth their voice” signifies the desolation of Divine truth in the church by the falsities of evil; “they reduce his land to a waste” signifies the destruction of the church itself by evils; “his cities are burned even so that there is no inhabitant” signifies the destruction of the doctrinals also of the church by evils, so that there is no good of the church left.

The vastation of the church is attributed to Jehovah, although men are the cause of it. “I call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the land” signifies falsity destroying every truth in the universal church. “Jehovah shall roar from on high, and give forth His voice from the abode of His holiness,” signifies the testification of grief in heaven on account of the vastation of Divine truth. “In roaring He shall roar against their habitations” signifies great grief and lamentation over all things of the church; “a tumult cometh even to the end of the earth” signifies the disturbance of all things of the church from first to last; “for Jehovah hath a controversy against the nations, He shall enter judgment with all flesh,” signifies visitation and judgment upon all who are in evils; “He shall give the wicked to the sword” signifies their destruction by falsities.

Here, too, “the roaring like that of a lion, and like that of young lions,” signifies grief and lamentation over the vastation of Divine truth in the church by the falsities of evil. “He seizeth the prey and none shall deliver” signifies the deliverance and salvation of those who are in truths from good. The vastation itself is described by “behold darkness, distress, and the light is darkened in the ruins thereof”; “darkness” meaning falsities; “distress” evil; “the darkening of the light” the disappearance of Divine truth, and “ruins” total overthrow.

This is evident from the signification of “speaking the voices,” as being to instruct, here from heaven, because it is said “the seven thunders spake”; also from the signification of “the seven thunders,” as being Divine truth in respect to understanding and perception (see above, n. 273). The thunders are said to be “seven,” because “seven” signifies all things and fullness, and is used when things holy are treated of (see above, n. 20, 24, 257, 300). It was the last state of the church about which John was instructed from heaven by voices like thunder, since that state is treated of in this chapter, as is evident from the words that follow: “In the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he is about to sound, the mystery of God shall also be finished; as He hath declared the good tidings to His servants the prophets” (verse 7); and that teaching shall go on in the church until that state, which is the end, shall come, is meant by the last words of this chapter, “Thou must prophesy again over many peoples and nations and tongues and kings” (verse 11).

That “to seal up” means to keep secret and to reserve until another time can be seen from what follows in this book; for what follows treats of the middle state of the church, which intervenes between the sounding of the sixth and of the seventh angel, that is, between next to the last state of the church and the last, therefore the things that are to take place in the last state are what must be reserved and not yet disclosed. 605.

This is said of the Lord; His dominion over all things of heaven and the church is meant by “all things are put under His feet.” And in Isaiah: I will make the place of My feet honorable (60:13). “The place of the Lord’s feet” in a general sense means all things of heaven and the church, since the Lord as a sun is above the heavens; but in a particular sense “the place of His feet” signifies the church, for the Lord’s church is with men in the natural world, and the natural is the lowest, into which the Divine closes, and upon which it as it were subsists. This is why the church on the earth is also called “the footstool of the Lord,” as in the same: The earth is My footstool (Isa. 66:1; Matt. 5:35). Also in Lamentations: He hath cast down from the heavens unto the earth the splendor of Israel, and doth not remember His footstool (2:1).

This is why the whole heaven is in the sight of the Lord as one man, and corresponds to all things of man, therefore heaven also is called the Greatest Man.

That “to swear” signifies asseveration and confirmation, but here verity (since it is the Lord that is meant by the angel that swears), can be seen from this, that “to swear” means to asseverate and confirm that a thing is so, and when done by the Lord means Divine verity; for oaths are made only by those who are not interiorly in truth itself, that is, by those who are not interior but only exterior men; consequently they are never made by angels, still less by the Lord; but He is said in the Word to swear, and the Israelites were allowed to swear by God, because they were only exterior men, and because the asseveration and confirmation of the internal man, when it comes into the external, falls into the form of an oath. In the Israelitish church all things were external, representing and signifying things internal. The Word in the sense of the letter is similar. From this it can be seen that “the angel sware by Him that liveth unto the ages of the ages” cannot mean that he thus sware, but that he said in himself that this is verity, and that when this came down into the natural sphere it was changed, according to correspondences, into the form of an oath. [2] Now as “to swear” is only an external corresponding to the confirmation that belongs to the mind of the internal man, and is therefore significative of that, so in the Word of the Old Testament it is said to be lawful to swear by God, yea, that God Himself is said to swear. That this signifies confirmation, asseveration and simply verity, or that it is true, can be seen from the following passages. In Isaiah: Jehovah hath sworn by His right hand and by the arm of His strength (62:8). In Jeremiah: Jehovah of Hosts hath sworn by His soul (51:14; Amos 6:8). In Amos: The Lord Jehovih hath sworn by His holiness (4:2)."

Jehovah is said “to have sworn by His right hand,” “by His soul,” “by His holiness,” and “by His name,” to signify by Divine verity; for “the right hand of Jehovah,” “the arm of His strength,” “His holiness,” “His name,” and “His soul,” mean the Lord in relation to Divine truth, thus Divine truth proceeding from the Lord; the like is meant by “the excellency of Jacob,” for “the mighty One of Jacob” means the Lord in relation to Divine truth. [3] That “to swear,” in reference to Jehovah, signifies confirmation by Himself, that is, from His Divine, is evident in Isaiah: By Myself have I sworn, the word has gone forth from My mouth, and shall not be recalled (45:23). In Jeremiah: By Myself I have sworn that this house shall become a desolation (22:5). Because “to swear” in reference to Jehovah signifies Divine verity it is said in David: Jehovah hath sworn truth unto David, He turneth11 not from it (Ps. 132:11). [4] Jehovah God, or the Lord, never swears, for to swear is not becoming to God Himself, or the Divine verity; but when God, or the Divine verity, wills to have anything confirmed before men, then that confirmation in its descent into the natural sphere falls into the form or formula of an oath, such as is used in the world. This shows why it is said in the sense of the letter of the Word, which is the natural sense, that God swears, although He never swears.

In Malachi: I will be a witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against those that swear to a lie (3:5). In Moses: Thou shalt not swear to a lie by My name, so that thou profane the name of thy God; also, Thou shalt not take the name of thy God in vain (Lev. 19:12; Deut. 5:11; Exod. 20:7; Zech. 5:4).

Especially was this granted to the sons of Jacob, because they were wholly external and natural men, and not internal and spiritual; and merely external or natural men wish to have the truth confirmed and witnessed to by oaths; but internal or spiritual men do not wish this; indeed, they turn away from oaths and shudder at them, especially those in which God and the holy things of heaven and the church are appealed to, and are content with saying and with having it said that a thing is true, or that it is so.

This is evident from these words of the Lord in Matthew: Ye have heard that it was said, Thou shalt not swear [falsely], but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oath; but I say unto you, swear not at all; neither by the heaven, for it is the throne of God; neither by the earth, for it is the footstool of His feet; neither by Jerusalem, for it is a city of the great King. Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, for thou canst not make one hair white or black (5:33–37). Here the holy things by which one must not swear are mentioned, namely, “heaven,” “earth,” “Jerusalem,” and the “head”; and “heaven” means the angelic heaven, wherefore it is called “the throne of God” (that “the throne of God” means that heaven, see above, n. 253, 462, 477); “the earth” means the church (see above, n. 29, 304, 413, 417), which is called therefore “the footstool of God’s feet” (that “the footstool of God’s feet” also means the church, see above, n. 606); “Jerusalem” means the doctrine of the church, wherefore it is called “the city of the great king” (that “city” means doctrine, see above, n. 223); and the “head” means intelligence therefrom (see above, n. 553, 577), therefore it is said “thou canst not make one hair white or black,” which signifies that man of himself can understand nothing. [10] Again, in the same: Woe unto you, ye blind guides, for ye say, Whosoever shall swear by the temple it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple he is a debtor! Ye fools and blind; for whether is greater, the gold or the temple that sanctifieth the gold?

And whosoever sweareth by the temple sweareth by it and by Him that dwelleth therein. And he that sweareth by heaven sweareth by the throne of God and by Him that sitteth thereon (Matt. 23:16–22).

Who created heaven and the things that are therein, and the earth and the things that are therein, and the sea and the things that are therein, signifies the Lord in respect to all things of heaven and the church, interior and exterior. This is evident from the signification of “to create,” as being not only to cause to be, but also to be perpetually, by holding it together and sustaining it by the Divine proceeding; for the heavens have had existence and perpetually have existence, that is, subsist by means of the Lord’s Divine, which is called the Divine truth united to Divine good. This received by angels makes heaven. Thence it is that when heaven is mentioned the Lord is meant, because heaven, where the angels are, is heaven from the Lord, that is from the Divine proceeding from Him. This, therefore, is what is signified here by “to create.” (That “to create,” in reference to the church and to men of the church, means to create anew, that is, to regenerate, may be seen above, n. 294.) The above is evident also from the signification of “heaven, earth, and sea, and the things that are in them,” as being all things of heaven and the church, interior and exterior. “Heaven, earth, and sea,” signify here in particular the higher and the lower heavens, since in the spiritual world the face of things is similar as in the natural world, that is, there are mountains, lands, and seas; the mountains there are the higher heavens, because the angels of those"

Thence it is that the angel who spoke these things was seen “standing upon the earth and the sea.” “The earth and the sea and the things that are in them” signify also all things of the church, both interior and exterior, because there are in the church things interior and exterior, as there are in the heavens things higher and lower, and the former correspond to the latter. (That “the sea and the earth,” signify the church in respect to its exteriors and interiors, may be seen above, n. 600.) According to the sense of the letter, “heaven, earth, and sea,” mean the visible heaven, the habitable earth, and the navigable sea, and “the things therein” mean birds, beasts, and fishes; but that this is not the meaning of these words is evident from this, that John was “in the spirit” when he saw the angel “standing upon the sea and upon the earth”; and what is seen “in the spirit” is seen not in the natural world but in the spiritual world, where also, as has been said just above, there are earths and seas, and angels and spirits in them.

That time shall be no more, signifies that there shall be no longer any understanding of Divine truth, nor any state of the church therefrom. This is evident from the signification of “time,” as being here the state of man in respect to the understanding of the Word, and thus the state of the church, because both the one and the other are treated of in this chapter. “Time” signifies state, because times in the spiritual world are determined and distinguished only by particular and general states of life. This is because the sun in that world, which is the Lord, does not move, but remains in the same place in heaven, and that place is the east; that sun does not there revolve through the heavens as the sun in the natural world appears to do. By the apparent revolution of the sun of the natural world times in general and in particular are determined, and thus have existence; in general, the year and its four seasons, called spring, summer, autumn, and winter. Moreover, these four seasons of the year are the four natural states of the natural world corresponding to the same number of states in"

In particular, within these general states in the natural world, there are determined and fixed times, called months and weeks, but especially days, and days are divided into four natural states, which are called morning, noon, evening, and night, corresponding to which there are four states in the spiritual world. In the spiritual world, because the sun, as has been said, does not revolve through the heavens but remains constant and fixed in its east, there are no years, months, weeks, days, or hours, consequently there are no determinations by times, but only determinations by states of life, general and particular. Therefore it is not known there what time is, but only what state is, for the determination of a thing is what gives the idea of it, and according to the idea is the thing named. This, then, is the reason that it is not known in the spiritual world what times are, although they succeed each other there the same as in the natural world, but instead of times there are states and their changes; this is the reason also that times, when mentioned in the Word, signify states. (But respecting time and times in the spiritual world, see in the work Heaven and Hell, n. 162–169; and on the changes of states of the angels, n. 154–161.13 [2] Since “time” means the things pertaining to time in the natural world, as those pertaining to the year and the day (those of the year are seedtime and harvest, and those of the day are morning and evening), by these things pertaining to time states of the church are described in the Word, “seedtime” describing and signifying the establishment of the church; “harvest” its fruit bearing; “morning” its first time, and “noon to evening” its progression. These natural states (or conditions) also correspond to spiritual states, which are states of heaven and the church. As concerns the church, the church in general passes through these states, so does each man of the church in particular. Moreover, each man of the church from his earliest age is also inaugurated into these states, but when the church is at its end he can no more be inaugurated, for he does not receive Divine truth, but either rejects or perverts it, therefore he has neither seedtime nor harvest, that is, no establishment and no fruit bearing, nor has he morning or evening, that is, neither beginning nor progression.

Behold, the morning is come upon thee, O inhabitant of the land, the time is come (7:5–7). This, too, was said of the state of the church. The end of the former church is first described, and the establishment of a new church afterwards, the end of the former church by this, “one evil, behold the evil cometh; the end is come, the end is come”; the establishment of a new church by this, “Behold, the morning is come upon thee, O inhabitant of the land, the time is come,” “morning” signifying the state of a new or commencing church, and “time” its progressive state; accordingly the meaning is similar as that of “seedtime and harvest” and “morning and evening,” mentioned above, consequently it means the state of the church in respect to the understanding of truth and the will of good.

With a similar meaning it is said in Revelation: That the woman should be nourished in the wilderness for a time and times and half a time (12:14).

In Genesis: During all the days of the earth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease (8:22). This may be seen explained in Arcana Coelestia (n. 930–937). In David: The day is Thine, the night also is Thine; thou hast prepared the light and the sun.

Jehovah said, If I shall not have set My covenant of day and night, the statutes of heaven and earth, I will reject also the seed of Jacob and of David14 My servant (33:25, 26). “The statutes of the sun, moon, and stars,” also “the covenant of day and night,” and “the statutes of heaven and earth,” have a similar signification as “times,” since “times” exist from those statutes. That “seedtime and harvest, summer and winter,” also “day and night,” have a similar signification as “times” has been said above. [7] It follows that “times” have the same signification in these words in Genesis: God said, Let there be luminaries in the expanse of the heavens, to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs and for seasons, and for days and for years (1:14–19). The two “luminaries,” the sun and moon, signify love and faith; for that chapter treats in the spiritual sense of the new creation, or the regeneration of the man of the church, and the things said respecting the sun and moon signify the things that chiefly regenerate man and make the church; therefore these words and those that follow describe the process by which regeneration is effected, and afterwards it describes their states.

The mystery of God shall also be finished, as He hath declared the good tidings to His servants the prophets, signifies prediction in the Word respecting the Lord’s coming, to be fulfilled when the end of the church is at hand. This is evident from the signification of “to be finished,” as being to be fulfilled; also from the signification of “the mystery of God as He hath declared the good tidings,” as being the Lord’s coming (of which presently); also from the signification of “His servants the prophets,” as being the truths of doctrine, here the Word. That those are called “servants of the Lord” who are in truths from good, may be seen above (n. 6, 409a ); and that those are called “prophets” who teach doctrine, and in the abstract sense “prophets” mean doctrines, will be further shown below. The Word also is meant, because the Word is the doctrine of Divine truth, and because the Word was written through the prophets; also because everything of doctrine must be from the Word.

[2] The end of the church is meant also by “evening,” and the Lord’s coming by “morning” in Daniel: Unto evening and morning two thousand three hundred (8:14, 26). “Evening” signifies the end of a former church, and “morning” the Lord’s coming and the beginning of a new church. “Morning” has a similar signification in Ezekiel: Behold an evil cometh, the end is come, the end is come; it hath awaked upon thee; behold it is come, the morning is come upon thee, O inhabitant of the land, the time is come (7:5–7).

In Isaiah: O Zion, proclaimer of good tidings, get thee up into the high mountain; O Jerusalem, proclaimer of good tidings, lift up thy voice with power; say unto the cities of Judah, Behold your God; behold, the Lord Jehovih cometh in strength, and His arm shall rule for Him; He shall feed His flock like a shepherd (Isa. 40:9–11). It is very clear that this is said of the Lord’s coming; and this is why Zion and Jerusalem are called “proclaimers of good tidings.” “Zion” means all who are of the celestial church, who are those that are in love to the Lord, therefore it is said, “get thee up into the high mountain,” “high mountain” signifying that love (see above, n. 405). “Jerusalem” means all who are of the spiritual church, who are those that are in the doctrine of genuine truth, therefore it is said, “lift up thy voice with power”; which signifies confession from genuine truths. “The cities of Judah,” to which it is said, “Your God, the Lord Jehovih, cometh in strength,” signify doctrinals from the Word, “cities” signifying doctrinals, and “Judah” the Word. Evidently Zion and Jerusalem are called “proclaimers of good tidings,” for the reason that “good tidings” mean the coming of the Lord, for it is said, “Behold your God, behold the Lord Jehovih cometh in strength.” That He will effect judgment, and will protect those who acknowledge Him, is signified by “His arm shall rule for Him, He shall feed His flock like a shepherd.” [4] In the same: How joyous upon the mountains are the feet of him that proclaimeth good tidings, that maketh peace to be heard, that proclaimeth good tidings of good, that maketh salvation to be heard; that saith unto Zion, Thy king15 shall reign, when he shall see eye to eye that Jehovah returneth to Zion (Isa. 52:7, 8). This, too, is said of the Lord’s coming, who is evidently meant by “thy king shall reign, when he shall see eye to eye that Jehovah returneth to Zion,” likewise in what follows in that chapter; this is why it is said “proclaim good tidings.” (The rest of the verse may be seen explained above, n. 365e.)

[5] In Isaiah: The spirit of the Lord Jehovih is upon me, therefore Jehovah hath anointed me to proclaim good tidings unto the poor; He hath sent me to bind up the broken in heart, to preach liberty to the captives, to the bound, to the blind; to proclaim the year of Jehovah’s good pleasure and the day of vengeance for our God; to comfort all that mourn (61:1, 2). That this was said of the Lord and His coming is evident in Matthew (5:3, et seq.) and in Luke (4:16–22). The coming itself is meant by “the year of Jehovah’s good pleasure and the day of vengeance for our God.” “The poor to whom the Lord will proclaim good tidings,” also “the captives,” “the bound” and “the blind,” mean the Gentiles who are said to be such because they have been ignorant of truth from not having had the Word. The Gentiles are also meant in Matthew by: The poor hear the gospel (11:5). In David: Sing unto Jehovah, bless His name; proclaim the good tidings of His salvation from day to day; for Jehovah cometh, for He cometh to judge the earth; He shall judge the world in righteousness, and the peoples in His truth (Ps. 96:2, 13). [6] The acknowledgment and celebration of the Lord with joy of heart because of His coming is signified by “Sing unto Jehovah, bless His name; proclaim the good tidings of His salvation from day to day.” The coming itself is described by “Jehovah cometh”; and as He comes when the Last Judgment is at hand it is said “He cometh to judge the earth; He shall judge the world in righteousness, and the peoples in truth,” “the earth” meaning the church, “the world” those in the church who are in the good of charity, and “the peoples” those who are in truths therefrom.

That when the end of the church is at hand the good tidings of the Lord’s coming will be proclaimed, is predicted also by the Lord Himself in the Gospels: These good tidings of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all the nations; and then shall the end come (Matt. 25:14; Mark 13:8–10). [7] That the Lord’s coming is meant by “proclaiming good tidings” and by “good tidings” can be seen also from the following passages. In Luke: The angel said to Zacharias, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God; and I was sent to speak unto thee, and to proclaim to thee these good things (1:19). The angel said to the shepherds, Be not afraid, behold I proclaim to you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. For there is born to you this day, in the city of David, a Savior, who is Christ the Lord (2:10, 11).

[8] Because “to proclaim good tidings” signifies to announce the Lord’s coming, “the good tidings” in the highest sense signify the Lord Himself in relation to His coming, in relation to judgment, and to the salvation of the faithful, in these passages in Mark: Jesus said, Whosoever shall wish to save his soul shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his soul for My sake and the Gospel’s shall save it (8:35; 10:29, 30). Jesus said to His disciples, Going into all the world, preach ye the Gospel to every creature (16:15). 613. Verses 8–10.

And when I had eaten it my belly was made bitter. 8. “And the voice which I heard from heaven again spake with me, and said,” signifies exploration of the men of the church as to what understanding of the Word yet remained with them (n. 614); “Go, take the little book that is open in the hand of the angel that standeth upon the sea and upon the earth,” signifies the Word laid open by the Lord to heaven and the church (n. 615). 9. “And I went unto the angel, saying unto him, Give me the little book,” signifies the faculty to perceive from the Lord of what quality the Word is (n. 616); “And he said unto me, Take and eat it up,” signifies that he should read, perceive, and explore the Word, of what quality it is within and of what it is without (n. 617); “and it shall make bitter thy belly” signifies that inwardly it was undelightful because adulterated (n. 618); “but in thy mouth it shall be sweet as honey” signifies that outwardly it was delightful"

Verse 8. And the voice which I heard from heaven again spake with me, and said, signifies exploration of the men of the church as to what understanding of the Word yet remained with them. This is evident from the things that precede and those that follow in this chapter; for “the voice from heaven that spake with him and said” involves these things. Those that precede treat of the understanding of Divine truth or of the Word, as can be seen from verses 2–4, where the “voice” with which the strong angel coming down from heaven cried out, and “the voices of the seven thunders” signify a manifestation of what the state of the church is in regard to the understanding of the Word (see above, n. 601–604). The things that follow treat of the understanding of the Word yet remaining with the men of the church; for “the little book that the angel had in his hand” signifies the Word, and “eating it up” signifies exploration, and that “it was sweet in the mouth and bitter in the belly” signifies that in the sense of the letter the Word was delightful, but in the internal sense, in which are the truths themselves, it was undelightful. This will further appear from what follows. As these are the things treated of and yet to be treated of, it is clear that “the voice that he heard from heaven again speaking and saying” signifies the exploration of the men of the church as to what understanding of the Word yet remained with them. [2] It is to be known that the understanding of the Word perishes in the church by degrees, as the man of the church from internal becomes external; and from internal he becomes external as he falls away from charity, consequently as he falls away from the life of faith.

Therefore the Word as to the sense of the letter may be loved, but for the reason that it can be drawn over to confirm the falsities arising from the love of self and of the world, for such is the Word in the letter. From this it comes that in the end of the church there is scarcely any understanding of truth. Truths from the Word are indeed then spoken with the mouth, but yet there is no idea of truth. It has been granted me to test whether this is so in the case of many in the spiritual world, and it was found that although, so far as they had spoken from the Word they had spoken truths, yet they had no understanding of them; thus they were like empty vessels and like tinkling bells, speaking only from such things as they drew forth from the memory, and not at all from any perception of the understanding. When man is such he cannot inwardly possess anything celestial or spiritual, but only what is natural, from the body and the world, and when this is separated from what is celestial and spiritual it is infernal. From this it can be seen what is meant in what follows by the little book given to John to eat being in his mouth sweet as honey, but that his belly was made bitter from it. 615. Go, take the little book that is open in the hand of the angel who standeth upon the sea and upon the earth, signifies the Word manifested by the Lord to heaven and the church. This is evident from the signification of “the little book that is open,” as being the Word manifested (see above, n. 599); also from the signification of the “angel who had the little book in his hand,” as being the Lord in relation to the Word (see above, n. 593); also from the signification of “sea and earth,” as being heaven and the church (see above, n. 600); and also from the signification of “standing upon them,” as being that all things in them are subject to the Lord (see above, n. 606). From this it can be seen that “the little book that is open in the hand of the angel who standeth upon the sea and upon the earth” signifies the Word manifested by the Lord to heaven and the church. The signification of “taking it and eating it up” will be shown in what follows."

This is evident from the signification of “going to the angel and saying, Give me the little book,” as being in the nearest sense to obey the command, because he was told to go and take it; but in a more remote sense, which also is the interior sense, these words mean the faculty to perceive from the Lord of what quality the Word is. It is granted by the Lord to every man to perceive this, but yet no one does perceive it unless he wishes as of himself to perceive it. Man must have this ability to reciprocate in order to receive the faculty to perceive the Word; unless a man wishes and does this as of himself no such faculty can be appropriated to him; since, in order that appropriation may be effected, there must be an active and a reactive; the active is from the Lord, so is the reactive, but the latter appears to be from man; for the Lord Himself gives this reactive, and thence it is from the Lord and not from man; but as man does not know otherwise than that he lives from himself, and consequently that he thinks and wills from himself, so he must needs do this as if it were from what is proper to his own life; and when he so acts, it is then first implanted in him, and conjoined and appropriated to him. [2] He who believes that Divine verities and goodnesses flow into man apart from such an ability to react or reciprocate, is much deceived, for this would be to let the hands hang down, and to wait for immediate influx; as those think who wholly separate faith from charity, and who say that the goods of charity, which are the goods of life, flow in without any cooperation of man’s will, when yet the Lord teaches that He continually stands at the door and knocks, and that man must open the door, and that He enters in to him who opens (Rev. 3:20). In brief, action and reaction constitute all conjunction, and in action and mere passiveness there is no conjunction; for when the agent or active flows into the mere patient or passive, it passes through and is dissipated, for the passive yields and retires; but when the agent or active flows into a passive that is also a reactive, then they join together and the two remain conjoined. Thus it is with the influx of Divine good and Divine truth into man’s will or love; for this reason when the Divine flows into the understanding alone it passes through and is dissipated,"

From this it can be seen what is involved in its being said, first, “Go, take the little book that is open in the hand of the angel who standeth upon the sea and upon the earth,” and then that he “went unto the angel, saying, Give me the little book,” and the angel then said, “Take and eat it up,” thus the ability to react or reciprocate is described. And from this then it is that these words signify the faculty to receive and perceive from the Lord of what quality the Word is. The reception of the Divine influx is described in like manner elsewhere in the Word. 617a. And he said unto me, Take and eat it up, signifies that he should read, perceive, and explore the Word, of what quality it is within and what it is without. This is evident from the signification of “he said unto me, Take the little book,” as being the faculty given to perceive of what quality the Word is, that is, what the understanding of the Word now is in the church (see the preceding article, n. 616); and from the signification of “to eat up” (or devour), as being to conjoin and appropriate to oneself, and as the Word is conjoined to man by reading and perception, here “to eat up” or “to devour” signifies to read and perceive. “To eat up” here signifies also to explore, because it is added that “the little book made his belly bitter,” and was perceived to be “in his mouth sweet as honey,” and by this it was ascertained what the Word, as regards its understanding, is within and without; what it is within is signified by “the belly and its bitterness,” and what it is without by the “mouth” in which it was perceived to be sweet as honey. From this it can be seen that “he said unto me, Take and eat it up,” signifies that he should read, perceive, and explore the Word, of what quality it is within and of what it is without. [2] “To eat” and “to drink” are often mentioned in the Word, and those who have no knowledge of the spiritual sense can have no other idea than that natural eating and drinking are thereby meant; but “to eat” and “to drink” signify to nourish oneself spiritually, consequently to appropriate to oneself good and truth, “to eat” signifying to appropriate to oneself good, and “to drink” to appropriate to oneself truth.

That “bread,” “food,” “wine,” and “drink” mean in the spiritual sense the nourishment of the mind, has been frequently shown above; also that the Word is spiritual throughout, although in the sense of the letter it is natural. To be nourished spiritually is to be instructed and imbued, consequently to know, to understand, and to be wise. Unless a man enjoys this nourishment together with the nourishment of the body, he is not a man but a beast; and this is why those who place all delight in feastings and banquetings and daily indulge their palates are dull in spiritual things, however they may be able to reason respecting the things of the world and of the body; therefore after death they live a life that is beastly rather than human, for instead of intelligence and wisdom they have insanity and folly. This has been said to make known that here “to devour or eat up the little book” signifies to read, to perceive, and to explore the Word, for “the little book” that was in the hand of the angel coming down from heaven means the Word, as has been said above. Moreover, one cannot eat or devour a book naturally, thus not the Word; and this, too, makes clearly evident that “to eat” here signifies to be spiritually nourished. [3] That “to eat” and “to drink” signify in the Word to eat and drink spiritually, which is to be instructed, and by instruction and living to imbue oneself with good and truth and to appropriate this, consequently intelligence and wisdom, can be seen from the following passages. In Jeremiah: Thy words shall be found, that I may eat them, and Thy Word be to me for joy and for the gladness of my heart (15:16). Here “to eat” manifestly stands for spiritual eating, which is to know, to perceive, and to appropriate to oneself, for it is said, “that I may eat Thy words, and Thy Word be to me for joy and for the gladness of my heart”; the “words of God” signify His precepts or Divine truths.

But He said, I have food to eat that ye know not. The disciples said one to another, Hath anyone brought Him aught to eat? Jesus said unto them, My food is to do the will of Him that sent Me, and to accomplish His work (John 4:31–34). [4] From this, too, it is evident that “to eat” signifies in the spiritual sense to receive in the will and to do, from which is conjunction; for the Lord by doing the Divine will conjoined the Divine that was in Him with His Human, and thus appropriated the Divine to His Human. To this may be referred: The Lord’s feeding the five thousand men, besides women and children, with five loaves and two fishes, and when they had eaten and were filled they took up twelve baskets of fragments (Matt. 14:15–22; John 6:5, 13, 23). Also His feeding four thousand men from seven loaves and a few fishes (Matt. 15:32, et seq.). This miracle was done because previously the Lord had been teaching them, and they had received and appropriated to themselves His doctrine; this is what they ate spiritually; therefore natural eating followed, that is, flowed in out of heaven with them as the manna did with the sons of Israel, unknown to them; for when the Lord wills, spiritual food which also is real food but only for spirits and angels, is changed into natural food, just as it was turned into manna every morning. [5] The like is signified by “eating bread in the kingdom of God” in Luke: I appoint unto you a kingdom that ye may eat and drink at My table in My kingdom (22:27, 29, 30)."

The like is signified elsewhere in Luke: Blessed is he that eateth bread in the kingdom of God (14:15). This is why the Lord there likened the kingdom of God: To a great supper, to which those invited did not come, and to which only those came who were brought in from the streets (verses 16–24). 617b. [6] Spiritual eating, by which the soul is nourished, is also signified by “eating” in the following passages. In Isaiah: If ye will be willing and obedient ye shall eat good (1:19). “To eat good” signifies spiritual good, therefore it is said, “If ye will be willing and obedient,” that is, if ye will do; for spiritual food is given, conjoined, and appropriated to man by his willing and his doing therefrom. In David: Blessed is everyone that feareth Jehovah, that walketh in His ways. Thou shalt eat the labor of thy hands; blessed art thou, and it is good with thee (Ps. 128:1, 2). “To eat the labor of his hands” signifies the celestial good that man receives from the Lord by a life according to Divine truths, and acquires as it were by his own labor and zeal, therefore it is said that he shall eat “who feareth Jehovah and walketh in His ways,” and it is added “Blessed art thou, and it is good with thee.” [7] In Isaiah:"

In Ezekiel: Thou didst eat fine flour, honey, and oil; whence thou didst become exceeding beautiful, and didst prosper even to a kingdom (16:13). This was said of Jerusalem, which signifies the church, here the ancient church, which was in truths and in spiritual good, and at the same time in natural good; “fine flour” signifies truth, “honey” natural good, or the good of the external man; and “oil” spiritual good, or the good of the internal man; the reception, perception, and appropriation of these goods is signified by “eating fine flour, honey, and oil”; that from these the church became intelligent is signified by “whence thou didst become exceedingly beautiful,” “beauty” signifying intelligence; that from these it became a church is signified by “thou didst prosper even to a kingdom,” “kingdom” signifying the church.

It is evident that the “Son” whom the virgin shall conceive and bear, and whose name shall be called “God with us,” is the Lord in respect to His Human; the appropriation, in respect to the Human, of spiritual and natural Divine good is meant by “butter and honey shall He eat,” spiritual Divine good by “butter,” natural Divine good by “honey,” and appropriation by “eating”; and because so far as it is known how to reject evil and to choose good, so far spiritual and natural Divine good is appropriated, therefore it is said, “that He may know to reject the evil and to choose the good.” That the"

That these kings are meant is evident from what follows in verses 17 and 18, where Egypt and Assyria are mentioned; moreover, these things also are what chiefly devastate the church. That the Lord came into the world when there was no longer any truth and good in the church, thus when there was nothing of the church remaining, has been said several times above. [9] In the same prophet: It shall come to pass by reason of the abundance of milk that one shall eat butter; for butter and honey shall everyone eat that remains in the land (Isa. 7:22). This is said of a new church to be established by the Lord; and “butter and honey” signify spiritual good and natural good, and “to eat” signifies to appropriate (as above); “milk” signifies the spiritual from the celestial, from which these goods are.

[12] In Isaiah: They shall build houses and inhabit them, and they shall plant vineyards and eat the fruit of them. They shall not build that another may inhabit, they shall not plant that another may eat (65:21, 22). Everyone knows what is signified by these words in the sense of the letter; but as the Word in its bosom is spiritual, spiritual things also are meant, that is, such things as belong to heaven and the church, for these are spiritual things. “To build houses and to inhabit them” signifies to fill the interiors of the mind with the goods of heaven and the church, and thereby to enjoy celestial life, “houses” signifying the interiors of the mind, and “to inhabit” celestial life therefrom. “To plant vineyards and to eat the fruit of them” signifies to enrich themselves with spiritual truths, and to appropriate to themselves goods therefrom; “vineyards” mean spiritual truths, “fruits” goods therefrom; and “to eat” to receive, perceive, and appropriate to themselves, for every good is appropriated to man by means of truths, that is, by a life according to them. This that has been said makes evident what is signified by “they shall not build that another may inhabit, they shall not plant that another may eat,” “another” signifying falsity and evil destroying truth and good; for when truths and goods perish with man falsities and evils enter. In Jeremiah: Build ye houses and inhabit them, and plant gardens and eat the fruit of them (29:5, 28). These words have a similar meaning as those just explained. [13] In Moses: That there shall be given in the land great and good cities which they builded not, houses full of every good thing which they did not fill, cisterns hewed out which they did not hew, vineyards and olive gardens which they did not plant; they shall eat to satiety (Deut. 6:10, 11)."

But these riches enumerated are worldly riches by which are meant spiritual riches, from which man has eternal life. The “great and good cities to be given” signify doctrinals from genuine goods and truths; “houses full of every good thing” signify the interiors of the mind full of love and wisdom; “cisterns hewn” signify the interiors of the natural mind full of the knowledges of good and truth; “vineyards and olive gardens” signify all things of the church, both its truths and its goods, “vineyards” meaning the church in respect to truths, and “olive gardens” the church in respect to goods, since “wine” signifies truth, and “oil” good; “to eat to satiety” signifies full reception, perception, and appropriation. [14] In Isaiah: He shall delight in Jehovah; and I will make thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and will feed thee with the heritage of Jacob (58:14). “To make to ride upon the high places of the earth” signifies to give an understanding of higher or interior truth respecting the things of the church and of heaven; and “to feed with the heritage of Jacob” signifies to bestow all things of heaven and the church; for “the heritage of Jacob” means the land of Canaan, and that land signifies the church, and in a higher sense heaven. 617c.

The “tree of the knowledge (scientia) of good and evil” signifies the knowledge of natural things, through which it is not permitted to enter into the celestial and spiritual things which belong to heaven and the church, thus to enter from the natural man into the spiritual, which is the inverse way, and therefore does not lead to wisdom, but destroys it. “Adam and his wife” mean the most ancient church, which was a celestial church. Because the men of that church were in love to the Lord they had Divine truths inscribed on them, and thence they knew from influx the corresponding things in the natural man, which are called knowledges; in a word, there was with them spiritual influx, that is, influx from the spiritual mind into the natural, and thus into the things that are in it, and what these were they saw by correspondence as in a mirror. [16] With them spiritual things were entirely distinct from natural things; spiritual things had their seat in their spiritual mind, and natural things in their natural mind, and thus they did not immerse what is spiritual in their natural mind, as spiritual-natural men are wont to do. For this reason, if they had consigned spiritual things to the natural memory, and had appropriated them to themselves in that way, that which was implanted with them would have perished, and they would have begun to reason about spiritual things from the natural man, and thus to form conclusions, which celestial men never do. This, moreover, would have been wishing to be wise from self-intelligence, and not from Divine intelligence, as before, and by this they would have extinguished all their celestial life, and they would have entertained natural ideas even about spiritual things. This, therefore, is what is signified by their “not eating of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil,” and if they did eat, “dying they should die.” The like is true of those who are in the Lord’s celestial kingdom as of these most ancient people"

(On this more may be seen in the work Heaven and Hell, n. 20–28, where the two kingdoms, celestial and spiritual, into which heaven is in general distinguished, are treated of.) [17] In David: He that did eat of My bread hath lifted up his heel against Me (Ps. 41:9). This is said of the Jews, who had Divine truths because they had the Word, as can be seen in John (13:18), where these words are applied to the Jews; therefore “to eat the Lord’s bread” signifies the appropriation of Divine truth, but here a communication of it, for the Jews could not appropriate it. “Bread” signifies the Word, from which is spiritual nutrition. “To lift up the heel against Him” signifies to pervert the sense of the letter of the Word even to denial of the Lord, and the falsification of every truth. For the Divine truth is presented in image as a man; this is why heaven in its whole complex is called the Greatest Man, and corresponds to all things of man; for heaven is formed according to the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord; and as the Word is the Divine truth, this, too, before the Lord is in image like a Divine Man; for this reason its ultimate sense, which is the mere sense of the letter, corresponds to the heel. The perversion of the Word, or of the Divine truth, by applying the sense of the letter to falsities, such as were the traditions of the Jews, is signified by “lifting up the heel against the Lord.” The whole heaven is in image like a man, and thence corresponds to all things of man, and heaven is such because it was created and formed by the Lord by means of the Divine truth proceeding from Him, which is the Word by which all things were made (John 1:1–3), as may be seen in the work Heaven and Hell (n. 59–102, and n. 200–212).

But He shall say, I know you not whence ye are; depart, ye workers of iniquity (13:26, 27). Their saying, when presented for judgment, that they “ate and drank before the Lord,” signifies that they had read the Word and drawn from it the knowledges of good and truth, supposing that this would save them; therefore it follows, “Thou didst teach in our streets,” which signified that they had been instructed in truths from the Word, thus by the Lord. But that reading the Word and being instructed from it is of no avail for salvation, without at the same time a life according to it, is signified by the answer, “He shall say, I know you not whence ye are; depart from Me, ye workers of iniquity”; for it is of no avail for salvation to enrich the memory from the Word and from the doctrinals of the church, unless they are committed to life. [19] In Matthew: The king said to them on his right hand, I was an hungered and ye gave me to eat; I was thirsty and ye gave me to drink. And to those on the left hand, I was an hungered and ye gave me not to eat; I was thirsty and ye gave me not to drink (25:34, 35, 41, 42). By these words also spiritual hunger and thirst and spiritual eating and drinking are signified; spiritual hunger and thirst are the affection and desire for good and truth, and spiritual eating and drinking are instruction, reception, and appropriation. It is said here that the Lord hungered and thirsted, because from His Divine love He desires the salvation of all; and it is said that men gave Him to eat and to drink; which is done when from affection they receive and perceive good and truth from the Lord, and by means of the life appropriate them to themselves. The like may be said of a man who from his heart loves to instruct man and desires his salvation; therefore it is charity, or the spiritual affection of truth, that is described by these words and those that follow. [20] From what has been said it can now be seen what is signified in the spiritual sense by eating bread and drinking wine in the Holy Supper, Matthew 26:26; Mark 14:22; where it is also said, that the"

There “bread” signifies the good of love, and “wine” truth from that good, which is the good of faith, and “flesh and blood,” have a similar signification, also “eating” signifies appropriation and conjunction with the Lord, as can be seen from what is said and shown in the New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine (n. 210–222). That such is the signification of “bread and wine,” and “body and blood,” also of “eating,” becomes still more evident from the Lord’s words in John: Your17 fathers did eat the manna in the wilderness, and they are dead. This is the bread which cometh down out of heaven; if anyone shall eat of this bread he shall live forever; and the bread that I will give is My flesh, which I will give for the life of the world. Verily I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink His blood ye have not life in you. He that eateth My flesh and drinketh My blood hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day. He that eateth My flesh and drinketh My blood abideth in Me and I in him. This is that bread that came down out of heaven. He that eateth of this bread shall live forever (John 6:49–58). Anyone who has the ability to think interiorly can see that neither flesh nor blood nor bread nor wine, are here meant, but the Divine proceeding from the Lord; for it is the Divine proceeding, which is Divine good and Divine truth, that gives eternal life to man, and causes the Lord to abide in man, and man in the Lord; for the Lord is in man in His own Divine and not in what is man’s own, for this is nothing but evil; and the Lord is in man, and man in the Lord, when the Divine proceeding is appropriated to man by a right reception. The appropriation itself is signified by “eating,” the Divine good proceeding, by “flesh” and “bread,” and the Divine truth proceeding, by “blood” and “wine.” It was similar in the sacrifices, in which the “flesh” and the “meal offering,” which was bread, signified the good of love, and the “blood” and “wine,” which were the drink offering, signified truth from that good, both from the Lord. Since “flesh” and “bread” signify the Divine good proceeding, and “blood” and “wine,” the Divine truth proceeding, “flesh” and “bread” mean the Lord Himself in relation to Divine good, and “blood” and “wine,” the Lord Himself in relation to Divine truth.

[21] Because “bread” signifies the Lord in relation to Divine good, and “to eat it” signifies appropriation and conjunction: When the Lord manifested Himself to the disciples after His death, when He brake bread and gave to them, their eyes were opened and they knew Him (Luke 24:30, 31). This, too, shows that “to eat bread” given by the Lord signifies conjunction with Him. Enlightened by this the disciples knew Him; for “eyes” in the Word correspond to the understanding and thence signify it, and this is what is enlightened; and thence “their eyes were opened.” “To break bread” signifies in the Word to communicate one’s good to another. [22] The Lord ate with publicans and sinners: At which the Jews murmured and were offended (Mark 2:15, 16; Luke 5:29, 32; 7:33–35); because the Gentiles that are meant by “publicans and sinners” received the Lord, imbibed His precepts, and lived according to them, and by this means the Lord appropriated to them the goods of heaven, and this is signified in the spiritual sense by “eating with them.” [23] Because “to eat” signifies to be appropriated, it was granted to the sons of Israel to eat of the sanctified things or of the sacrifices, for the “sacrifices” signified Divine celestial and spiritual things, and thus “eating” of them signified their appropriation. Because the appropriation of holy things was signified by such “eating,” various laws were given, prescribing who should eat and where they should eat and of what sacrifices, thus: What Aaron and his sons should receive and eat of the sacrif ices (Exod. 29:31–33; Lev. 6:16–18; 7:6, 7; 8:31–33; 10:13–15);"

In these and many other statutes and laws respecting the eating of things sanctified are contained arcana respecting the appropriation of Divine good and Divine truth, and thus of conjunction with the Lord; but this is not the place to unfold the particulars, only let it be known from the passages cited, that “to eat” signifies to be appropriated and conjoined. So again: When the sons of Israel were joined to the Lord by the blood of the covenant, and when Moses had read the book of the law before them, and they presently saw the God of Israel, it is said that they did eat and drink (Exod. 24:6–11). [24] That “to eat flesh and drink blood” signifies the appropriation of spiritual good and truth, can be seen in Ezekiel: Thus said the Lord Jehovih, Gather yourselves from every side to My sacrifice that I do sacrifice for you, a great sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel, that ye may eat flesh and drink blood. Ye shall eat the flesh of the mighty and drink the blood of the princes of the earth. And ye shall eat fat to satiety, and drink blood even to drunkenness, of My sacrifice which I sacrifice for you. Ye shall be satiated at My table with horse and with chariot, with the mighty man and with every man of war. So will I give My glory among the nations (39:17–21)."

The full fruition of these is signified by “eating fat to satiety, and drinking blood to drunkenness,” “fat” signifying interior goods, and “blood” interior truths, which were disclosed by the Lord when He came into the world, and were appropriated by those who received Him. [25] Before the Lord’s coming into the world, to eat fat and drink blood was forbidden, because the sons of Israel were in externals only, for they were natural-sensual men, and not at all in things internal or spiritual, consequently if they had been permitted to eat fat and blood, which signifies the appropriation of interior goods and truths, they would have profaned them, therefore “eating fat and blood” signified profanation. “To be satiated at the Lord’s table with horse and with chariot, with the mighty man and with every man of war” has a similar signification; “horse” signifying the understanding of the Word; “chariot,” the doctrine from the Word; “the mighty man and the man of war,” good and truth fighting against evil and falsity and destroying them, and “the mountains of Israel upon which they should eat,” the spiritual church in which the good of charity is the essential. All this makes very clear that “to eat” signifies to appropriate to oneself, and that “flesh,” “blood,” “mighty man,” “princes of the earth,” “horse,” “chariot,” and “man of war,” signify the spiritual things that are to be appropriated, and by no means natural things, for to eat such things naturally would be abominable and diabolical. Similar things are signified by: Eating the flesh of kings, of commanders of thousands, of horses, and of them that sit upon them, free and bond (Rev. 19:18). 617e. [26] As most things in the Word have also a contrary sense, so have “to eat” and “to drink”; and in that sense they signify to appropriate evil and falsity, and thus to be conjoined to hell; as can be seen from the following passages.

The devastation of the church and lamentation over it are signified by “to be called in that day to weeping, lamentation, baldness, and girding with sackcloth”; lamentation over the destruction of truth is signified by “weeping,” over the destruction of good by “lamentation,” over the destruction of all affection of good by “baldness,” and over the destruction of the affection of truth by “sackcloth”; “to slay an ox and to slaughter a sheep” signifies to extinguish natural good and spiritual good; “to eat flesh and drink wine” signifies to appropriate evil and falsity, “flesh” here signifying evil, “wine,” the falsity of evil, and “to eat and drink” these, to appropriate to oneself. [27] In Ezekiel: The prophet was told to eat food by weight and with care, and to drink water by measure and with astonishment; and that he should eat a cake of barley made with dung; and that thus shall the sons of Israel eat their bread unclean among the nations whither they shall be thrust out, and they shall be in want of bread and water, and be made desolate, a man and his brother, and shall waste away for their iniquity (4:10–17). These words in the prophet represented the adulteration of Divine truth, or of the Word, with the Jewish nation; “the cake of barley made with dung” signifies such adulteration, “a cake of barley” meaning natural good and truth, such as the Word is in the sense of the letter, and “dung,” infernal evil; therefore it is said, “thus shall the sons of Israel eat their bread unclean,” “bread unclean” meaning good defiled with evil, that is, adulterated. That “they would be in want of bread and water among the nations whither they should be driven” signifies that they would no more have good and truth because of being in evils and falsities, “nations” signifying evils and falsities, and “to be thrust out thither,” to be delivered up to these; “man and broth er” who shall be made desolate, signify faith and charity, “man” signifying the truth of faith, and “brother,” the good of charity, and “to be made desolate,” the"

All things in that chapter relating to particular beasts and birds, and to their hoofs, feet, and cud, by which the clean are distinguished from the unclean, are significative.

This describes the extinction of good by falsity and of truth by evil; the extinction of all good and truth, however it is sought for, is signified by “if he shall cut down on the right hand he shall still be hungry, and if he shall eat on the left hand they shall not be satisfied”; “to cut down and to eat” on the right and left means to search for, “to be hungry and not be satisfied” means not to be found, or if found to have no ability to receive; “they shall eat every man the flesh of his own arm” signifies that falsity shall consume good, and evil truth, in the natural man; “Manasseh Ephraim, and Ephraim Manasseh,” signifies that the will of evil shall consume the understanding of truth, and the understanding of falsity shall consume the will of good.

[31] In Matthew: In the consummation of the age it shall be as it was before the flood, eating and drinking, contracting marriage, and giving in marriage (24:38; Luke 17:26–28). “To eat and drink, to contract marriage, and give in marriage” does not mean here to eat and drink, nor to contract marriage, and give in marriage, but “to eat” means to appropriate evil, “to drink” to appropriate falsity, “to contract marriage and give in marriage,” to conjoin falsity with evil, and evil with falsity; for this treats of the state of the church when the Last Judgment is at hand; for this is signified by “the consummation of the age.” Evidently the good as well as the evil will then be eating and drinking, for there is nothing evil in eating and drinking, and this they also did before the flood, and it was not on this account that they perished, but because they appropriated to themselves evil and falsity, and conjoined these in themselves; this, therefore, is what is here signified by “eating and drinking, and by contracting in marriage and giving in marriage.” [32] In Luke: The rich man said to his soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thy rest, eat, drink (12:19)."

It seems as if “eating and drinking” and “surfeiting” in these passages mean such luxury and intemperance as those indulge in who follow appetite only; this is indeed the natural literal sense of these words; but in their spiritual sense they mean the appropriation of evil and falsity, as can be seen from the passages cited above, where this is signified by “eating and drinking,” also from this, that the Word in the letter is natural, but interiorly is spiritual; the spiritual sense is for the angels, and the natural for men. [33] Besides these many other passages might be cited from the Word, testifying and confirming that “to eat” signifies to receive, perceive, and appropriate to oneself such things as nourish the soul; for “to eat” spiritually is simply to imbue the mind with its own food, which is to wish to know, understand, and become wise in such things as pertain to eternal life. That this is the signification of “to eat” can be seen also from the signification of “bread” and “food,” as also of “famine” and “hunger,” and of “wine” and “water,” which have been treated of above in their proper places. Since “to eat” means to perceive the quality of a thing, and this is perceived by its taste, it is from correspondence that in human language taste (sapor) and to have a taste (sapere) are predicated of the perception of a thing, and from this comes wisdom (sapientia). 618.

Now as “sweet” signifies what is delightful from the good of truth and the truth of good, so “bitter” signifies what is undelightful because of adulterated truth. What is undelightful thence is not perceived and felt as bitter by anyone in the natural world, but by the spirit and angel in the spiritual world; for every adulterated good of truth, when it is changed with them into taste, is clearly perceived as bitter. For spirits and angels equally with men have taste, but the taste of spirits and angels flows forth from a spiritual source, but that of men from a natural source; the taste of bitterness with spirits is from the adulterated truth of good, but with men it is from a mixture of what is sweet with what is offensive. John’s sensation of bitterness was also from a spiritual origin, for he was in the spirit, otherwise he could not have eaten the little book. Adulterated truth means the truth of good applied to evil and mixed with its falsity, and this is done when the truths of the sense of the letter of the Word are applied to filthy loves, and are thus mixed with evils.

From this it can be seen that “the little book would make bitter, and did make bitter, the belly,” signifies that the Word was inwardly undelightful. This undelightfulness thus far spoken of is spiritual undelightfulness; but there is also a spiritual-natural undelightfulness that is also meant by this “bitterness,” which is that the truth of doctrine inwardly gathered from the sense of the letter of the Word and called its literal sense, is undelightful to those who are in falsities of evil; for this relates to the understanding of the Word by the men of the church at its end, when they are for the most part in falsities from evil; and to such the falsities of evil, confirmed from the sense of the letter of the Word, are delightful,19 but truths confirmed from the literal sense of the Word are undelightful. This, too, is signified by “the little book made bitter the belly, but in the mouth was like honey, sweet.” [3] That “bitter” signifies the truth of good adulterated can also be seen from the Word where “bitter” is mentioned, as in the following passages. In Isaiah: Woe unto them that call evil good and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter! Woe unto the mighty to drink wine, and to the men of strength to mingle strong drink (5:20, 22). Evidently good and truth adulterated are here signified by “bitter,” for it is said, “Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness,” which signifies the adulteration of good and the falsification of truth; for good is adulterated when “good is called evil and when evil is called good,” and truth is falsified when “darkness is put for light and light for darkness,” “darkness” meaning falsities, and “light” truths. This makes clear that like things are signified by “putting bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter,” also by “Woe unto the mighty to drink wine, and to the men of strength to mingle strong drink”; “the mighty to drink wine” signify those who adulterate the truth of the Word, and “the men of strength to mingle strong drink” signify those who falsify it, “wine” and “strong drink” meaning the truths of the"

They shall not drink wine with a song; strong drink shall be bitter to them that drink it (Isa. 24:7, 9). “The new wine that shall mourn,” and “the vine that shall languish,” signify the truth of the Word and of the church which has been lost, “new wine” signifying the truth of the Word, and the “vine” the truth of the doctrine of the church; “all the glad in heart shall sigh, and they shall not drink wine with a song,” signifies that internal blessedness of mind and felicity of heart will perish because of the loss of the truth of spiritual good; “strong drink shall be bitter to them that drink it,” signifies the truth of good made undelightful by its falsification and adulteration. [5] In Moses: The waters in Marah, that they were unable to drink because of the bitterness, were healed by the wood that was cast into them (Exod. 15:23–25). “The waters in Marah, that they were unable to drink because of their bitterness,” represented truths adulterated, “waters” signifying truths, and “bitterness” adulteration. “Healing them by wood cast into them” represented the good of love and of life dispelling falsity and opening truth, and thus restoring it; for all truth is adulterated by the evil of life and of love, consequently it is opened and restored by the good of love and of life, because all truth is of good, and the good of love is like a fire, from which truth appears in light.

[7] Because the sons of Jacob perverted all the truths of the Word, and by applying them to themselves and to earthly loves falsified and adulterated them, it is said of them in the song of Moses: That their vine is of the vine of Sodom and of the fields of Gomorrah, and their grapes are grapes of gall, their clusters are of bitternesses (Deut. 32:32). A “vine” signifies the church in respect to truth, consequently also the truth of the church; and “the grapes” signify the goods therefrom, which are the goods of charity, and “clusters”, the goods of faith; from which it is evident that “clusters of bitternesses” signify the goods of faith adulterated. [8] In the same: That the waters of the curse should be given to the wife accused by her husband of adultery, and if she was20 guilty the waters would become bitternesses in her, and the belly would swell and the thigh fall away (Num. 5:12–29). The marriage of man and wife signifies the marriage of truth and good, for love truly conjugial descends from that spiritual marriage; therefore “adultery” signifies the conjunction of falsity and evil, and this was why “if she was guilty the waters became bitternesses,” which signifies the adulteration of good; and as the “belly” signified conjugial love, in like manner as the womb, and also the thigh, so “the belly swelled and the thigh fell away,” which signifies in the spiritual sense that the conjugial or conjugial love itself, spiritual and natural, had perished; “the womb” or “belly” signifying spiritual conjugial love, and the “thigh” natural conjugial love.

But in thy mouth it shall be sweet as honey, signifies outwardly delightful. This is evident from the signification of “mouth,” as being what is exterior; for this treats of the little book and eating it up, and “the little book” signifies the Word, and “eating it up” signifies perception and exploration; thence “the mouth,” which first receives, means the external of the Word. It is evident also from the signification of “sweet as honey,” as being the delight of natural good. The external of the Word was “sweet as honey,” that is, thus delightful, because the external of the Word is such that it can be applied to any love whatever, or to any principle derived therefrom; and these can be confirmed by it. The external of the Word, which is the sense of its letter, is such because many things in it are written in accordance with the appearances presented to the natural man, and many appearances, when not interiorly understood, are fallacies, like the fallacies of the senses. Those, therefore, who love to live for the body and for the world, by means of these appearances draw over the external of the Word to confirm evils of life and falsities of faith.

This is why the things in the spiritual sense of the Word are undelightful, for in that sense are the truths themselves which are not according to appearances; as that the Jewish nation itself was not holy, but worse than every other nation, consequently that it was not chosen; that the city of Jerusalem merely signifies the Lord’s church and doctrine respecting Him and the holy things of heaven and the church; and that the temple, the ark, the altar, and the sacrifices represented the Lord and the holy things that proceed from Him, and that for this and no other reason were they holy. These are truths that are stored up inwardly in the sense of the letter of the Word, that is, in its internal spiritual sense; and these truths they deny, because, as was said, they have falsified and adulterated the Word in the sense of the letter; and these things therefore are undelightful to them, like foods that are bitter in the belly. [3] It is said that the little book was “in the mouth sweet as honey,” because “honey” signifies the delight of natural good; that “honey” signifies that delight can be seen from the following passages. In Ezekiel: It was said to the prophet, Open wide thy mouth and eat that I give thee. And I saw and behold, a hand was put forth unto me, and lo, the roll of a book was therein; and when he had spread it before me it was written in front and behind, and written thereon were dirges, moaning, and woe. Then he said unto me, Son of man, eat this roll, and go speak unto the house of Israel. Then he said unto me, Feed thy belly and fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee; and when I ate it, it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness. And he said, Go to the house of Israel and speak my words unto them (2:8–10; 3:1–4). These things involve things altogether similar to those in Revelation. The command to the prophet Ezekiel “to eat the roll of the book” involves something similar as the command to John “to eat the little book,” namely, to explore how the Divine truth which is in the Word is yet received, perceived, and appropriated by those who are of the church; for the prophet Ezekiel and John represent the doctrine of truth and the Word, therefore the exploration was made with them. It was made by eating a book, because “to eat” signifies to perceive and thus to appropriate, as has been shown"

[4] In Isaiah: A virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call His name God with us. Butter and honey shall He eat, that He may know to reject the evil and to choose the good (7:14, 15). That this was said of the Lord is proved in Matthew (1:23). Anyone can see that “butter and honey” do not mean here butter and honey, but something Divine corresponding to them, for it is added, “that He may know to reject the evil and to choose the good,” and that is not known by eating butter and honey; but “butter” signifies the delight of spiritual good, and “honey” the delight of natural good, consequently the two signify the Lord’s Divine spiritual and Divine natural, and thus His Human, interior and exterior. That the Lord’s Human is meant can be seen from its being said that “a virgin shall conceive and bear a son”; and that it is Divine from its being said, “and shall call His name God with us,” “to call a name” signifying the quality of a thing, here what the Divine is, for He was to be called “God with us.” [5] “Butter and honey” also signify the delight of spiritual and natural good in these words in the same chapter: Butter and honey shall everyone eat that remains in the land (verse 22)."

He shall not see the streams, the flowings of the brooks of honey and butter (20:16, 17). This is said of hypocrites who talk well and smoothly about God, about the neighbor, and about heaven and the church, and yet think altogether otherwise; and because they cunningly contrive by these means to captivate minds, although in heart they cherish what is infernal, it is said, “He shall suck the poison of asps, the viper’s tongue shall slay him.” That such have no delight in natural good or spiritual good is meant by “He shall not see the streams, the flowings of the brooks of honey and butter,” “streams” meaning the things of intelligence, and “the flowings of the brooks of honey and butter,” the things therefrom that are of affection and love, which are the very delights of heavenly life. Every delight of life that abides to eternity is a delight of spiritual good and truth, and from that a delight of natural good and truth; but hypocritical delight is a natural delight separate from spiritual delight, and this delight is turned in the other life into what is direfully infernal. Evidently “butter and honey” do not mean here butter and honey, for where, in the world, can there be found “flowings of brooks of honey and butter”? [7] “Milk and honey” have a similar signification as “butter and honey”; and as “milk” signifies the delight of spiritual good, and “honey” the delight of natural good, and these delights are with those who are of the Lord’s church, therefore the land of Canaan, which signifies the church, was called: A land flowing with milk and honey (Exod. 3:8, 17; Lev. 20:24; Num. 13:27; 14:8; Deut. 6:3; 11:9; 26:9, 15; 27:3; 31:20; Josh. 5:6; Jer. 11:5; 32:22; Ezek. 20:6)."

These goods with their delights are signified by “milk and honey.” 619b. [8] There was also much honey in the land of Canaan at that time, because at that time the church of the Lord was there, as can be seen from the first book of Samuel, where it is said: That they came into the forest, where there was honey upon the face of the ground, and there was a stream of honey, and Jonathan’s eyes were opened by tasting the honey (14:25–27, 29). “Jonathan’s eyes were opened by tasting the honey” because “honey” corresponds to natural good and its delight, and this good gives intelligence and enlightens, from which Jonathan knew that he had done evil; as we read in Isaiah, “He shall eat butter and honey, that he may know to reject the evil and to choose the good.” For at that time correspondences exhibited their effects outwardly, since all things of the Israelitish church consisted of correspondences, which represented and signified things celestial and spiritual. [9] Again, “oil and honey” have a similar signification as “butter and honey” in the following passages. In Moses: He made him to ride on the high places of the earth, and fed him with the produce of the fields; he made him to suck honey out of the cliff, and oil out of the flint of the rock (Deut. 32:13). This is in the song of Moses, which treats of the church in its beginning, and afterward in its progress, and finally in its end. Those that constituted the ancient church are described by these words, not those however who constituted the Israelitish church, for these were evil from the beginning even to the end, as can be seen from their fathers in Egypt, and afterwards in the wilderness; but the ancient church, the men of which are meant by “their"

(That “oil” signifies the good of love and charity, may be seen above, n. 375; and that “cliffs” and “rocks” signify truth from the Lord, n. 411, 443a.) [10] In David: I fed21 them with the fat of wheat, and with honey out of the rock I satisfied them (Ps. 81:16). “The fat of wheat” signifies the delight of spiritual good, and “honey out of the rock,” the delight of natural good through truths from the Lord (as above). It is to be known that natural good is not good unless there is also spiritual good; for all good flows in through the spiritual man or mind into the natural man or mind, and so far as the natural man or mind receives the good of the spiritual man or mind so far man receives good; that there may be good there must be both, or the two sides, consequently natural good separated from spiritual good is in itself evil, although by man it is still perceived as good. Since there must be both, it is said in the passages cited and yet to be cited, “butter and honey,” “milk and honey”; “fat and honey,” as also “oil and honey,” and “butter,” “milk,” “fat,” and “oil” signify the good of spiritual love, and “honey” the good of natural love, together with their delights. [11] In Ezekiel: Thus wast thou decked with gold and silver, and thy garments were fine linen and silk and broidered work; thou didst eat fine flour, honey, and oil, whence thou didst become exceeding beautiful, and didst prosper even to a kingdom.

This is said of the land of Canaan, which means the church which is in celestial, spiritual, and natural good, and in truths therefrom; but the contents of this verse are explained above (n. 374c, 403b), showing that “oil and honey” here signify the good of love in the internal or spiritual man and in the external or natural man. [14] In David: The judgments of Jehovah are truth, they are righteous altogether; more desirable than gold and than much fine gold; and sweeter than honey and the dropping of honeycombs (Ps. 19:9, 10). I have not departed from Thy judgment; for Thou hast instructed me. How sweet are Thy words to my palate, more than honey to my mouth (Ps. 119:102, 103). “Judgments” signify the truths and goods of worship, therefore it is said “the judgments of Jehovah are truth, they are righteous altogether”; “righteous” signifies the good of life and worship therefrom; and as good is also signified by “gold” and “fine gold,” it is said that “they are more desirable than gold and than much fine gold,” “gold” meaning celestial good, “fine gold” spiritual good, and “desirable” what belongs to affection and love. Since the goods by which a man is affected are delightful it is said that they are “sweeter than honey and the dropping of honeycombs,” and that “the words of Jehovah are sweet to the palate, more than honey to the mouth,” “sweet” signifying what is delightful, “honey” natural good, and “the dropping of honeycombs” natural truth. And because “honey” means natural good, and the “mouth” signifies what is external, it is said “more than honey to my mouth,” as in Revelation, that “the little book was sweet as honey in the mouth.” [15] In Luke: Jesus said to the disciples, who believed that they saw a spirit, See My hands and My feet, that it is I Myself; feel of Me and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones as ye see Me having.

From the series of these words regarded in the spiritual sense it is very evident that “honeycomb” and “honey” signify natural good, for the Lord disclosed to His disciples that He had glorified or made Divine His whole Human, even to its natural and sensual; this is signified by “hands and feet” and by “flesh and bones,” which they saw and felt, “hands and feet” signifying the ultimate of man which is called the natural, “flesh” its good, and “bones” its truth; for all things that are in the human body correspond to spiritual things, “flesh” corresponding to the good of the natural man, and “bones” to its truths. (On this correspondence, see in the work Heaven and Hell, n. 87–102.) And this the Lord confirmed by eating the broiled fish and honeycomb before the disciples; “the broiled fish” signifying the truth of good of the natural and sensual man, and “the honeycomb,” the good of the truth of the same. The Lord, therefore, by letting them feel of Him, showed and confirmed that His whole Human, even to its ultimates, was glorified, that is, made Divine; and this He showed, too, by the eating, in that “He ate before them a piece of broiled fish and of a honeycomb.” 619c.

For John the Baptist represented something similar as Elijah; wherefore it is also said that “Elijah should come,” by whom John is meant. Elijah represented the Lord in relation to the Word, or the Word from the Lord; John had a similar representation; and as the Word teaches that the Messiah or the Lord was about to come, John was sent before to preach respecting the Lord’s coming, according to the predictions in the Word.

It is the same whether you say the truth and good of the natural man or natural truth and good, such as the Word is in its ultimate sense, which is called the sense of the letter or the natural sense, for this was what John represented by his raiment and food.

This is evident from the things that precede, namely, that “the little book” means the Word, “the angel” the Lord in relation to the Word, and “to devour or to eat it” means to receive, perceive, and appropriate to oneself, consequently to explore, here of what quality the understanding of the Word still is in the church. Exploration is effected by means of a thing’s being perceived and the way in which it is perceived; it was effected with the prophet John, because a “prophet” signifies the doctrine of the church, and in a universal sense, the Word. 621.

The other perception however is signified by its taste when it has come into the belly, which is said to be made bitter by it. This other perception of the Word is such as the perception of its spiritual sense is, that is, as the Word is inwardly. Consequently, as the “mouth” signifies what is exterior, so here the “belly” signifies what is interior, because inwardly received and ascertained. The “belly” signifies interior things because the belly stores up the food inwardly, and “food” signifies everything that nourishes the soul; also because the belly, like the bowels, is within or in the midst of the body; for this reason the “belly,” and also the “bowels,” signify in the Word interior things. [2] That the “belly,” and the “bowels” signify interior things can be seen from the following passages. In Ezekiel: Son of man, feed thy belly and fill thy bowels with this roll (3:1, 3). This has a similar signification as what is now being explained in Revelation, that “he took and ate up the little book,” for the “roll” has a similar signification as “the little book,” namely, the Word, and “to feed the belly and fill the bowels with the roll” signifies to explore how the Word is understood in the church, which is done by the reading and perception of it. [3] In David: Fill their belly with Thy treasure; the sons are fed to the full, and what remains to them they leave to their babes (Ps. 17:14). “Treasure” signifies the truth of the Word, “belly” the interior understanding, so “to fill their belly with treasure” signifies to instruct their interior understanding in the truths of the Word; that thence those who are affected by truths are fully instructed is signified by “the sons are fed to the full,” “sons” signifying those who are in the affection of truth; and the sons’ “babes,” truths in their birth; of such it is said that “what remains to them they leave"

      "text": "APOCALYPSE EXPLAINED 2001 to their babes.” It is here said the interior understanding, for man has an exterior understanding and an interior understanding; the exterior understanding is of the natural mind, and the interior understanding is of the spiritual mind; the interior understanding is signified by the “belly.” [4] In John: Jesus said, If anyone thirst let him come unto Me and drink. He that believeth on Me, as the Scripture saith, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water. This He said of the Spirit which they that believe on Him were to receive (7:37–39). Thus the Lord describes Divine truth inwardly perceived by those who are in the spiritual affection of truth; such are meant by “those who thirst and come to the Lord and drink”; that such shall have an understanding of Divine truth is signified by “out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water,” “rivers out of the belly” meaning interior understanding or intelligence, and “living water,” Divine truth from the Lord; and as “the Holy Spirit” means Divine truth proceeding from the Lord, it is added “this He said of the Spirit which they that believe on Him were to receive.” [5] In Mark: Whatsoever from without goeth into the man cannot render him unclean, because it goeth not into his heart but into the belly; and is cast out into the draught purging all foods. But that which goeth forth out of the man, that rendereth the man unclean; for from within out of the heart of men it goeth forth (7:18–21; Matt. 15:17–20). These words must be thus understood, that all things, whether falsities or evils, that from things seen or things heard flow into the thought of the understanding and not into the affection of its will, do not affect or infect the man, since the thought of a man’s understanding, so far as it does not proceed from the affection of his will, is not in the man but outside of him, therefore it is not appropriated to him; it is similar with truth and good. This the Lord teaches by correspondences when He says that “that which enters through the mouth into the belly does not render a man unclean, because it does not enter into the heart, for that which"

These spiritual things the Lord explained by natural things, since the foods that are taken into the mouth and thus pass into the belly signify such things as man takes in spiritually and with which he nourishes his soul; this is why the “belly” corresponds to the thought of the understanding and signifies it. That the “heart” signifies the affection of man’s will has been shown above; also that only that which is made a part of a man’s affection or will is appropriated to him. Evidently spiritual, not natural, things are here meant, for the Lord says that “out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, whoredoms, thefts, false testimonies, blasphemies.” Since the falsities and evils that enter from without into the thoughts enter from the hells, and if not received by man with the will’s affection are cast back into the hells, it is said that “they are cast out into the draught,” for the “draught” signifies hell; and for the reason that in the hells all things are unclean, and those who are there have been cast out of heaven, which is like a man in form, and is therefore called the Greatest Man and also corresponds to all things of man, while the hells correspond to what is cast out of the belly of the Greatest Man or heaven; this is why hell is meant in the spiritual sense by the “draught.” The “belly” is said “to purge all foods,” because the “belly” signifies the thought of the understanding, as has been said above, and “foods” signify all spiritual nourishments, and the thought of the understanding is what separates unclean things from what are clean, and thus purges. [6] In Jeremiah: Jehovah God hath said, Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon hath confounded Me, he hath placed Me as an empty vessel, he hath swallowed Me up as a whale, he hath filled his belly with My delicacies, he hath thrust Me out (51:34)."

[7] In David: Be gracious unto me, O Jehovah, for I am in distress; mine eye wasteth away with vexation, my soul and my belly (Ps. 31:9). “Eye, soul, and belly,” here signify the understanding and exterior and interior thought of truth therefrom; thus the “belly” signifies the interiors of the understanding, which are said “to waste away with vexation” when they are destroyed by falsities. [8] In the same: Our soul is bowed down to the dust, our belly cleaveth unto the earth (Ps. 44:25). Here, too, “soul” and “belly” signify in the spiritual sense the thought of the understanding; and “bowed down to the dust,” and “cleaving to the earth,” signify to be imbued with falsities, for “dust” and “earth” signify what is infernal and damned. What is infernal and damned is signified also by “going upon the belly” and “eating dust,” as was said to the serpent: Be thou cursed above all beasts, and above all the wild beasts of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life (Gen. 3:14). For this reason also: It was strictly forbidden to eat anything that goeth upon the belly, for it was an abomination (Lev. 11:42)."

For this reason, in the spiritual world no one lies with the belly upon the ground; and indeed, to walk there with the feet upon the ground means to touch and drink in what is exhaled from the hells with the corporeal natural, which corresponds to the soles of the feet; and this natural has no communication with the thoughts of the understanding, except in those who are in evils in respect to life and in falsities in respect to doctrine. [9] In Job: The belly prepareth deceit (15:35). I am filled with words, the spirit of my belly causes anguish for me; and my belly, like wine, is not opened (32:18, 19); which means inability to open the thoughts of one’s understanding. In Jeremiah: O Jerusalem, wash thy heart from evil, that thou mayest be saved. How long shall thoughts of thy iniquity lodge in thy belly? (4:14). Here thoughts are plainly attributed to the belly, for it is said, “How long shall thoughts of iniquity lodge in thy belly?” and evil is attributed to the heart, because the heart corresponds to the will, in which evil has its seat. In David: There is no certainty in the mouth of anyone; perditions are their belly; their throat is an open sepulcher; they flatter with their tongue (Ps. 5:9). Here “perditions,” that is, evil thoughts, are attributed to “the belly.” In the same:"

In Habakkuk: My belly trembled, my lips quivered at the voice (3:16). “My belly trembled” signifies grief of thought, therefore it is added, “my lips quivered at the voice,” which signifies a consequent stammering of the speech: The bowels of the whale in which Jonah was three days and three nights (Jonah 1:17); signifies the hells where there are most direful falsities, with which he was encompassed, consequently grievous temptations, as can be seen from the prophecy of Jonah in the next chapter, where it is also said: Out of the belly of hell have I cried, and Thou hast heard my voice (2:2). 622b.

In Isaiah: O that thou hadst hearkened to My commandments! Thy seed would have been as the sand, and the issue of thy bowels like the grains thereof (48:18, 19). In David: I was cast upon Thee; from my mother’s belly Thou art my God (Ps. 22:10). Thou dost possess my reins; Thou hast covered me in my mother’s belly (Ps. 139:13). The wicked are estranged from the womb; they err from the belly, speaking falsehood (Ps. 58:3). So elsewhere. [13] The “belly” or “bowels” signify the interiors of the thought or of the understanding, because there are two lives with man, the life of the understanding and the life of the will; to these two fountains of life all things of the body correspond; consequently under their direction all things of the body are acted upon and act, even to the extent that any part of the body that does not suffer itself to be put in action by the understanding and the will has no life. For this reason the universal body is subject to the control of these two lives, for all things in the body that are moved, and so far as they are moved by the respiration of the lungs, are subject to the control of the life of the understanding; and all things in the body"

This is why “soul” and “heart” are often mentioned in the Word, and why the “soul” signifies the life of the understanding, also the life of faith, for the soul is predicated of respiration; and why the “heart” signifies the life of the will, also the life of the love. For the same reason “the belly and bowels” are predicated of thought, which is of the understanding, and the “heart” is predicated of affection, which is of the will. 623. Verse 11. And he said to me, Thou must again prophesy upon peoples and nations and tongues and many kings. 11. “And he said to me, Thou must again prophesy,” signifies Divine command to still teach the Word (n. 624); “upon peoples and nations and tongues and many kings,” signifies with all who are in truths and goods in respect to life, and at the same time in goods and truths in respect to doctrine, consequently to teach the Word in respect to the goods of life and the truths of doctrine (n. 625). 624a. Verse 11. And he said to me, Thou must again prophesy, signifies Divine command to still teach the Word. This is evident from the signification of “saying,” when the angel speaks, by whom in this chapter the Lord in relation to the Word is represented, as being command, for what the Lord says is a command; also from the signification of “to prophesy,” as being to teach the Word (of which presently). It is said he must still teach the Word, because such understanding of the Word as still remained in the church was explored, and it was found that the Word was delightful in respect to the sense of the letter, for this is signified by “the little book was in the mouth sweet as honey,” “the little book” meaning the Word. It was commanded to still teach the Word in the church, because its end was not yet come. The end of the church is described by “the sounding of the seventh angel”; but here the state of the church next before the end is described by “the sounding of the sixth angel”; this state of the church is here treated of.

[2] Why the Word must still be taught although its interior truths are undelightful, and why the Last Judgment does not come until the consummation, that is, when there is no longer any good or truth remaining with the men of the church, is wholly unknown in the world, although known in heaven. The reason is that there are two classes of men upon whom judg ment is effected; one class consists of the well-disposed, and the other of those who are not well-disposed. The well-disposed are the angels in the ultimate heaven, most of whom are simple, because they have not cultivated the understanding by interior truths, but only by exterior truths from the sense of the letter of the Word, according to which they have lived; for this reason their spiritual mind, which is the interior mind, was not indeed closed, but neither has it been opened, as it is with those who have received interior truths in doctrine and in life; this is why they have become simple in respect to spiritual things, and are called well-disposed. But the ill-disposed are those who have lived outwardly as Christians but inwardly have admitted evils of every kind into the thought and into the will, so that while in the external form they appeared to be angels, in internal form they were devils. When such come into the other life they come into association for the most part with the well-disposed, that is, with the simple good who are in the ultimate heaven; for exterior things consociate, and the simple good are such that what appears in external form to be good they believe to be good, their thought not penetrating farther. These ill-disposed must be separated from the well-disposed before the Last Judgment comes, and also afterward and they can only be separated successively. This is why before the time of the Last Judgment the Word must still be taught, although interiorly, that is, in respect to its interiors, it is undelightful; and as these interior things are undelightful they do not receive them, but only such things from the sense of the letter of the Word as favor their loves and the principles derived from them, on account of which the Word in respect to the sense of the letter is delightful to them. It is therefore by means of these interior things that the well- disposed are separated from the ill-disposed."

Whence then are these tares? And they said, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up? But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares ye root up at the same time the wheat with them. Let both, therefore, grow together until the harvest; and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them; but gather the wheat into the barn. He that hath sowed the good seed is the Son of man; the field is the world; the good seed are the sons of the kingdom; the harvest is the consummation of the age. As then the tares are gathered up and burned in the fire, so shall it be in the consummation of this age (13:27–30, 37–43). “The consummation of the age” signifies the last time of the church; that until then the well-disposed are not to be separated from the ill-disposed, because they are consociated by outward things, is signified by “lest while ye gather up the tares ye root up at the same time the wheat with them.” (On this see the small work on the Last Judgment, n. 70.) 624b.

This a “prophet” signifies, therefore “to prophesy” signifies to teach the Word and doctrine from the Word. That such is the signification of “to prophesy” and “prophet” can be seen from passages in the Word where these are mentioned, understood in the spiritual sense, as in the following. In Matthew: Many will say to Me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied by Thy name, and by Thy name cast out demons, and in Thy name done many mighty works? But then will I profess unto them, I know you not; depart from Me, ye that work iniquity (7:22, 23).

This makes clear what these words mean, namely, that worship of the Lord by prayers and by words of the mouth only is meant by “Many will say to Me in that day, Lord, Lord”; and to teach the Word and doctrinals from the Word is meant by “have we not prophesied by Thy name?”; “name” signifying according to doctrine from the Word, and “to prophesy” to teach; “to cast out demons” signifies to deliver from falsities of religion, “demons” meaning the falsities of religion; “to do many mighty works” signifies to convert many. But because these works were done not for the Lord’s sake, nor for the sake of truth and good and the salvation of souls, but for the sake of self and the world, thus only that they might appear in outward form, so in reference to themselves it was not good but evil that was done; this is meant by the Lord’s saying “I know you not, ye that work iniquity.” Doing such things does not appear to be working iniquity, and yet everything that a man does for the sake of self and of the world is iniquity, since there is in it no love of the Lord and of the neighbor, but only the love of self and the world; and his own love awaits everyone after death.

Because the falsities of evil are what must be refuted, this is said to Amaziah, who represented the perverted church; “his wife shall be a harlot” signifies the falsification and adulteration of the Word; “his sons and daughters shall fall by the sword” signifies that the truths and goods of the church will be destroyed by the falsities of evil; and “the land shall be divided by line” signifies that the church and everything belonging to it will be scattered. [11] In Hosea: By a prophet Jehovah caused Israel to come up out of Egypt, and by a prophet was he guarded. Ephraim hath provoked to anger with bitterness; therefore he shall leave his bloods upon him (12:13, 14). By the “prophet” here in the nearest sense Moses is meant, by whom Israel was led out of Egypt and afterwards guarded; but in the spiritual sense “prophet” means the Lord in relation to the Word, and “Israel” all those of the church who are in truths from good, and “Egypt” the natural man, which separated from the spiritual man is damned. Therefore “By a prophet Jehovah caused Israel to come up out of Egypt” signifies that the Lord leads out of damnation those who are in truths from good by means of the Divine truth, which is the Word, and guards them by means of it. “Ephraim hath provoked to anger with bitterness” signifies that they perverted the Word as to the understanding of it, “Ephraim” signifying the understanding of the Word, and “bitterness” perversions and falsities therefrom, from which is what is undelightful; “therefore he shall leave his bloods upon him” signifies damnation on account of the adulteration of the truth that is in the Word. [12] In the same: The days of visitation are come, the days of retribution are come; Israel, the foolish prophet, and the man insane of spirit, shall know it; this because of the multitude of iniquity and great hatred.

The falsities of evil are signified by “the multitude of iniquity,” and the evils of falsity by “great hatred”; “Ephraim who is a watchman with God” signifies the understanding of the Word, and this is why he is called “a watchman with God”; but as those who are in the falsities of evil and in the evils of falsity pervert the understanding of the Word, and thus craftily lead astray, it is said “the prophet is the snare of a fowler, and hatred in the house of God.” [13] In Ezekiel: Prophesy against the prophets of Israel that prophesy, and say thou to the prophets out of their own heart, Hear ye the word of Jehovah; Thus saith the Lord Jehovih, Woe unto the foolish prophets that go away after their own spirit, and after that which they have not seen! And My hand shall be against the prophets that behold vanity, and that divine falsehood (13:2, 3, 9). By “prophets” here and elsewhere in the Word are meant in the nearest sense such prophets as those were in the Old Testament through whom the Lord spoke; but in the spiritual sense those prophets are not meant, but all whom the Lord leads; with these also the Lord flows in and reveals to them the secrets of the Word, whether they teach or not; such, therefore, are signified by “prophets” in the spiritual sense. But “the prophets that prophesy out of their own heart, and go away after their own spirit, and who behold vanity and divine falsehood,” mean all who are not taught and led by the Lord but by themselves, consequently they have insanity in place of intelligence, and folly in place of wisdom, for they have the love of self in place of the love to God, and the love of the world in place of the love to the neighbor, and from these loves falsities continually pour forth. From this it can be seen what these words signify in series."

[15] In many passages “prophets” are mentioned, and no one has had any other idea respecting them than that the prophets of the Old Testament, through whom the Lord spoke unto the people, and through whom He dictated the Word, are meant; but as the Word has a spiritual sense in each and every particular of it, therefore in that sense “prophets” mean all whom the Lord teaches, thus all who are in the spiritual affection of truth, that is, who love truth, because it is truth, for the Lord teaches these, and flows into their understanding and enlightens; and this is more true of these than of the prophets of the Old Testament, for they did not have their understanding enlightened, but the words they were to say or write they received merely by hearing, and did not even understand their interior sense, still less their spiritual sense. From this it can be seen that “prophets” mean in the spiritual sense all who are wise from the Lord; and this whether they teach or do not teach. And as every truly spiritual meaning is abstracted from the idea of persons, places, and times, so the “prophet” also signifies in the highest sense the Lord in relation to the Word, and as to doctrine from the Word, and likewise the Word and doctrine; and in the contrary sense “prophets” signify the perversions and falsifications of the Word and the falsities of doctrine. As this is what “prophets” signify in both senses, I will cite a few passages only in which prophets are mentioned, and in which they mean all who receive and teach the Word and doctrine, and in a sense separate from persons the Word and doctrine, and in the contrary sense those"

Jehovah hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep, and hath closed your eyes; your prophets and your heads, the seers, hath He covered (29:10). In Jeremiah: They have denied Jehovah when they said, It is not He, neither shall evil come upon us, neither shall we see sword and famine. But the prophets shall become wind, and the word is not in them (5:12, 13). I have sent unto them all My servants the prophets, daily rising up early and sending them (7:25). Thus said Jehovah of Hosts against the prophets, Behold I will feed them with wormwood, and make them drink waters of gall; for from the prophets of Jerusalem is hypocrisy gone forth into all the land. Hearken not unto the words of the prophets that prophesy unto you; they make you vain; they speak the vision of their own heart, and not out of the mouth of Jehovah (23:15, 16). The prophets that have been before me and before thee of an age prophesied over many lands and over great kingdoms, of war, and of evil, and of pestilence. The prophet who prophesieth of peace, when the word of the prophet shall come to pass that prophet shall be known that God sent him (28:8, 9). In Matthew: Woe unto you, hypocrites and Pharisees, because ye build the sepulchers of the prophets, and adorn the tombs of the righteous, and say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.

O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killest the prophets, and stonest them that are sent unto thee (23:29–37; Luke 11:47–51). In these passages it seems as if “prophets” mean merely the prophets through whom Jehovah, that is, the Lord, spoke, consequently that by “slaying the prophets” the Lord simply meant their slaughter. But the Lord meant at the same time the slaughter and extinction of Divine truth that comes from the falsification and adulteration of the Word; for by a person and his function the thing itself which the person did and said is meant in the spiritual sense; thus a “prophet” means Divine truth or the Word and doctrine therefrom; therefore as the function of a person and the person are in effect one, so the thing itself that the prophet teaches is meant by “prophet.” “To shed blood” also means to adulterate the truths of the Word; and as the Jewish nation was such it is said, “O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killest the prophets, and stonest them that are sent unto thee,” these words meaning in the spiritual sense that such extinguish all Divine truth which they have from the Word. [17] Because a “prophet” means Divine truth, which is the Word, and which is in the church from the Word, and this cannot be extinguished except by those who have the Divine truth of the Word, therefore the Lord said: That it was not fitting for a prophet to perish out of Jerusalem (Luke 13:33). “Jerusalem” meaning the church in respect to the doctrine of truth. 624e. In the Word “priest and prophet” are also often mentioned, and “priest” means there one who leads men to live according to Divine truth, and “prophet” one who teaches it. In this sense “priest and prophet” are mentioned in the following passages. In Jeremiah: The law shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the Word from the prophet (18:18)."

The houses of Israel are ashamed; they, their kings, their princes, and their priests, and their prophets (2:8, 26); not to mention many other passages where “prophets and priests” are mentioned together, and thereby “priests” are meant those who teach life, and lead to good, and by “prophets” those who teach truths which lead; but in an abstract sense “priests” and “the priesthood” mean the good of love, consequently the good of life, and “prophets” the truth of doctrine, consequently the truth that leads to the good of life; in a word, “prophets” must teach, and “priests” lead. [19] In Zechariah: In that day I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land, that they may no more be remembered; and also I will cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land; and it shall come to pass that when any man shall prophesy anymore, his father and his mother that begat him shall say unto him, Thou shalt not live; and his father and his mother that begat him shall thrust him through. It shall come to pass in that day that the prophets shall be ashamed every man of his vision when they have prophesied, neither shall they wear a tunic of hair to dissemble; and he shall say, I am no prophet, I am a man that tilleth the ground, for a man sold me from boyhood (13:2–5). This is said of the Lord’s coming into the world, and of the abolition of representative worship and of the falsities with which the doctrine of the church then abounded; for the Jewish nation, with which the church was, placed all worship in externals, and nothing in internals, that is, nothing in charity and faith, which are internal, but in sacrifices, and in such things as are external, consequently their worship and doctrine consisted of mere falsities, and the nation itself, viewed in itself, was idolatrous. The abolition of such things by the Lord is described by these words of the prophet; therefore “I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land, that they may no more be remembered,” signifies the abolition of idolatrous worship, that is, of worship merely external without any internal; “I will cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land” signifies the abolition of the falsities"

The same is meant by “his father and his mother that begat him shall thrust him through.” The abolition of the falsities of doctrine is meant also by “the prophets shall be ashamed, every man of his vision, neither shall they wear a tunic of hair to dissemble,” “prophets” and “their vision” here also meaning the falsities of doctrine, and “to wear a tunic of hair to dissemble” signifying to pervert the external things of the Word such as are in the sense of its letter, for “tunic of hair” with the prophets represented the ultimate sense of the Word, the same as “the raiment of camel’s hair” of John the Baptist. His saying “I am a man that tilleth the ground, for a man sold me from boyhood,” signifies that this is the case with those of the Jewish church, which was merely external, not internal, because of their being born in it, and consequently devoted to it.

This is said of the Lord’s coming, when iniquity is consummated, or when there shall be no longer any good or truth remaining in the church. “Upon the people and upon the city of holiness” signifies upon the church and its doctrine, which are then wholly vastated and extinguished. “To finish the transgression and to seal up sins” signifies when all in the church are in the falsities of doctrine and in evils in respect to life, for, as has been shown at the beginning of this article, the Lord’s coming and the Last Judgment therewith do not take place until there is no longer any truth of doctrine or good of life remaining in the church, and this for the"

[21] In Moses: Jehovah said unto Moses, I have set thee a god to Pharaoh; and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet (Exod. 7:1). The Lord said to Moses, “I have set thee a god to Pharaoh,” because Moses represented the Law, by which is meant the Divine truth, and this too is signified by “God” in the spiritual sense; for Moses received from the Lord’s mouth the words that he was to say to Pharaoh, and he who receives these is called a “god”; this is why angels are called “gods,” and thence also signify Divine truths. That Aaron was “his prophet” signifies that he taught the truth received by Moses and declared it to Pharaoh, for a “prophet,” as has been said above, signifies one that teaches truth, and in an abstract sense the doctrine of truth. (But this may be seen more fully explained in Arcana Coelestia, n. 7268, 7269.) [22] This is why the prophets of the Old Testament represented the Lord in relation to the doctrine of Divine truth, and the chief of them represented the Lord in relation to the Word itself, from which comes the doctrine of Divine truth, as Moses, Elijah, Elisha, and John the Baptist; and as the Lord is the Word, that is Divine truth, He Himself in the highest sense is called a “Prophet.” As Moses, Elijah, and John the Baptist represented the Lord as to the Word:"

There “Moses and Elijah” mean the Word both historical and prophetical, “Moses” the historical Word, and “Elijah” the prophetical, and for the reason that when the Lord was transfigured He presented Himself in the form in which the Divine truth is in heaven. That Elijah represented the Lord as to the Word is evident from the miracles done by Him, all of which signified such things as belong to Divine truth or the Word; and as John the Baptist in like manner represented the Lord as to the Word he was called “Elijah,” as can be seen in Malachi: Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the great and terrible day of Jehovah cometh; and He shall turn the heart of the fathers to the sons, and the heart of the sons to the fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse (4:5, 6). And it is openly declared: That John was Elijah (Matt. 11:14; 17:10–12; Mark 9:11–13); not that he was Elijah, but he represented something similar to that which Elijah represented, that is, the Word; and as the Word teaches that the Lord was to come into the world, and because, moreover, in each and all particulars in the inmost sense the Word treats of Him, therefore: John was sent before Him to teach them that the Lord was to come (as may be seen Matt. 11:9, 10; Luke 1:76; 7:26). [23] From this it can now be seen why the Lord is called a “Prophet,” namely, because He was the Word, that is, Divine truth itself (as is evident from John 1:1, 2, 14). That the Lord is called a “Prophet” because He was the Word can be seen also in Moses: Jehovah thy God will raise up unto thee a prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ye shall hearken. I will put My words in his mouth, that he may speak unto you all that I shall command him. The man who will not hearken unto My words which he shall speak in My name, of him I will require it (Deut. 18:15–19)."

By this also the representation of the Lord by Moses is described; for the Lord from Jehovah, that is, from the very Divine that was in Him from conception, spoke with Himself; this is meant by “I will put My words in his mouth, that he may speak unto you all that I shall command him”; and this, too, was represented with Moses by “Jehovah spake with him mouth to mouth, and not as with other prophets.” Again this is why: The Lord is called a Prophet (Matt. 21:11; Luke 7:16; John 7:40, 41; 9:17). 625.

[2] “Many kings” signify various truths that are from good, because the peoples and nations outside of the church were for the most part in falsities as to doctrine, and yet because they lived a life of love to God and of charity towards the neighbor the falsities of their religion were accepted by the Lord as truths, for the reason that there was inwardly in their falsities the good of love, and the good of love gives its quality to every truth, and in this case it gives its quality to the falsity that such accept as truth; and moreover, the good that lies concealed within causes such when they come into the other life to perceive genuine truths and accept them. Again there are truths that are only appearances of truth, like those truths that are in the sense of the letter of the Word; these appearances of truth are accepted by the Lord as genuine truths when there is in them the good of love to the Lord and the good of charity towards the neighbor; and with such in the other life the good that lies hidden within dissipates the appearances, and makes bare the spiritual truths which are genuine truths. From this it can be seen what is here meant by “many kings.” (But respecting falsities in which there is good that exist among the Gentiles, see in the New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine, n. 21.) [3] From what has been said and shown in this and the preceding article, it can be seen that “he must again prophesy upon peoples, and nations, and tongues, and many kings” signifies that the Word must still be taught to those who are in goods and truths in respect to doctrine, and thence are in life; but as it is said “upon peoples, nations, tongues, and kings,” these words signify also that the Word must be taught in respect to the goods of life and the truths of doctrine, for these two are what the Word in its whole complex contains. [4] This is the sense of these words abstracted from persons, which is the truly spiritual sense.

It is from this that angels have intelligence and wisdom, and that thence angelic intelligence and wisdom are ineffable. While man lives in the world he is in natural thought, and natural thought derives its ideas from persons, places, times, and material things, and if these should be taken away from man, his thought which comes to perception would perish, for without these he comprehends nothing; but angelic thought is apart from ideas drawn from persons, places, times, and material things; and this is why angelic thought and speech are ineffable, and to man also incomprehensible. [5] And yet a man who has lived in the world a life of love to the Lord and of charity towards the neighbor comes, after his departure from the world, into that ineffable intelligence and wisdom; for his interior mind, which is the very mind of his spirit, is then opened, and then the man, when he becomes an angel, thinks and speaks from that mind, and consequently thinks and speaks such things as he could not utter or comprehend in the world. Such a spiritual mind, which is like the angelic mind, every man has; but because man while in the world speaks, sees, hears, and feels, by means of a material body, that mind lies hidden within the natural mind, or lives above it; and what man thinks in that mind he is wholly ignorant of; for the thought of that mind then flows into the natural mind, and there limits, bounds, and so presents itself as to be seen and perceived. So long as man is in the body in the world, he does not know that he has within him this mind, and in it possesses angelic intelligence and wisdom, because, as has been said, all things that abide there flow into the natural mind, and thus become natural according to correspondences. This has been said to make known what the Word is in the spiritual sense, which sense is wholly abstracted from persons and places, that is, from such things as derive their quality from the material things of the body and the world."
