      "text": "APOCALYPSE EXPLAINED 2741 Editor’s Preface This edition of Apocalypse Explained was translated by John C. Ager and revised by John Whitehead. The text was electronically scanned from the Swedenborg Foundation’s Standard Edition of 1911-1912. This process allowed the books to be completely reset in a more readable typeface. It also allowed for updating certain stylistic elements and for substituting contemporary spellings. Arabic numbers have replaced the Roman numerals, and some of the longer passages have been divided into paragraphs for greater ease of reading. The Ager/Whitehead translation, however, has not been materially altered. Volume 5 of Apocalypse Explained continues Swedenborg’s verse- by-verse exposition, or commentary, of the biblical text of the Apocalypse, commonly known as Revelation or the Revelation of John. As was the custom in his day, Swedenborg referred to the Psalms as the book of David, and to the Pentateuch (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy) as the books of Moses. In this volume Swedenborg interrupts his exposition of the text with occasional articles, or \"continuation\" passages, some of which are untitled. The contents page lists where the two major continuations begin. These articles are added throughout Revelation 14 and 15. Interested readers may wish to consult R. L. Tafel’s Documents Concerning Swedenborg (London: Swedenborg Society, 1875, 1877), volume 2, pages 984ff, for further information about these passages. As with previous printings, the bold numerals in brackets, [2], [3], etc., indicate divisions of Swedenborg’s longer numbered sections that were added for the convenience of the reader by J. F. Potts in his six-volume Swedenborg Concordance (London: Swedenborg Society, 1888-1902). The numbers in parentheses (6), (7), etc., are divisions of the exposition by the author. Italicized letters following a number (817a, 817b) are subdivisions added by the Latin editor, S. H. Worcester.

And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion; and the dragon gave him his power and his throne and great authority. 3. And I saw one of his heads as if it had been wounded to death; and the stroke of his death was healed; and the whole earth wondered after the beast. 4. And they worshipped the dragon which gave authority unto the beast; and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like unto the beast? Who is able to make war with him? 5. And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and there was given unto him authority to work forty-two months. 6. And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme His name and His tabernacle and them that dwell in heaven. 7. And it was given unto him to make war with the saints and to overcome them; and there was given to him authority over every tribe and tongue and nation. 8. And all that dwell on the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world. 9. If anyone hath an ear let him hear. 10. If anyone shall lead into captivity he shall go into captivity; if anyone shall kill with the sword he must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints. 11. And I saw another beast coming up out of the earth, and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon. 12. And all the authority of the first beast he exerciseth before him; and he maketh the earth and them that dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose stroke of his death was healed."

And I saw a beast coming up out of the sea having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten diadems, and upon his heads a name of blasphemy. 1. “And I saw a beast coming up out of the sea,” signifies reasonings from the natural man confirming the separation of faith from life (n. 774); “having seven heads,” signifies knowledge (scientia) of holy things, which are falsified and adulterated (n. 775); “and ten horns,” signifies much power (n. 776); “and upon his horns1 ten diadems,” signifies power from the appearances of truth in abundance (n. 777); “and upon his heads a name of blasphemy,” signifies the falsifications of the Word (n. 778). 774. Verse 1. And I saw a beast coming out of the sea, signifies reasonings from the natural man confirming the separation of faith from life. This is evident from the signification of “a beast coming up out of the sea,” as being the things that belong to the natural man; for “beasts” signify in the Word the affections of the natural man, in both senses (see above, n. 650); and the “sea” signifies the various things of the natural man that have reference to its"

Thence it is clear that “a beast coming up out of the sea” signifies reasonings from the natural man. It is evident that these are reasonings that confirm the separation of faith from life, because in this chapter the dragon is further described, “the beast coming up out of the sea,” signifies the reasonings of the dragon from the natural man confirming the separation of faith from life, and “the beast coming up out of the earth” signifies the confirmations of the dragon from the sense of the letter of the Word, and the falsification of it (see below, from verse 11 to the end of this chapter). [2] That the dragon is further described in this chapter, and is also meant by the two beasts, is evident from its being said that “the dragon gave to the beast coming up out of the sea his power and his throne and great authority,” and furthermore, that “they worshipped the dragon which gave authority unto the beast;” also that “the other beast that came up out of the earth spake as a dragon, and exercised all the authority of the first beast before the dragon.” Thence it is clear that so far as those who separate faith from life (who are signified by “the dragon,”) confirm that separation by reasonings from the natural man, they are represented by “the beast coming up out of the sea;” while so far as they confirm that separation by the sense of the letter of the Word, and thereby falsify that sense, they are described by “the beast coming up out of the earth.” That this is so can be fully seen from the description of each that follows. [3] That reasonings from the natural man enter into the dogmas of those who make faith the only means of salvation, thus the very essential of the church, and so separate it from life or from charity, which they do not acknowledge as a means of salvation and as an essential of the church; this is but little seen, and consequently but little known, by the followers and those learned in that doctrine, because their thought is continually fixed on those passages of the Word by which they confirm that doctrine. And as the dogmas they confirm by the ultimate sense of the Word, which is the sense of the letter of the Word, are falsities, they must needs take their"

That life or charity may be separated from faith, they contend (1) That by Adam’s fall man lost all freedom to do good from himself; and (2) for this reason man is in no wise able to fulfill the law; and (3) without the fulfilling of the law there is no salvation; and (4) that the Lord came into the world that He might fulfill the law, and thus His righteousness and merit might be imputed to man, and by that imputation man might be loosed from the yoke of the law even to the extent that nothing condemns him; and (5) that man accepts the imputation of the Lord’s merit by faith alone, and not at all by works. That these are mostly reasonings from the natural man confirming the assumed principle of faith alone and its connecting derivatives can be seen from a survey of these particulars in their order. [4] (1) “By Adam’s fall man lost his free will, which is a freedom to do good from himself.” This reasoning is from falsities; for no man has or can have a freedom to do good from himself, since man is merely a recipient; consequently the good that man receives is not man’s but is the Lord’s with him. Nor do angels even have any good except from the Lord; and the more they acknowledge and perceive this the more they are angels, that is, higher and wiser than the others. Still less, therefore, could Adam, who was not yet an angel, be in a state of good from himself. His integrity consisted in a fuller reception of good and truth, and thus of intelligence and wisdom from the Lord, than his posterity enjoyed. This also was the image of God; for a man becomes an image by receiving the Lord, and he becomes an image in the measure of this reception. In a word, to do good from the Lord is freedom; and to do good from self is slavery. Thence it is clear that this reasoning originates in falsities that flow forth from fallacies, which are all from the natural man. Moreover, it is not in accordance with truth that hereditary evil was ingenerated in the whole human race by Adam’s fall; its origin was from another source. [5] (2) “From this it is that man is in no wise able to fulfill the law.” This reasoning, too, is from the natural man. The spiritual man knows that doing the law and fulfilling it in external form"

The internal form, or the internal of the law, is to love what is good, sincere, and just; and its external is to do this. This the Lord teaches in Matthew: Cleanse first the inside of the cup and the platter, that the outside of them may become clean also (23:26). Man fulfills the law so far as he does it from the internal, but not so far as he does it from the external apart from the internal. The internal of man is his love and will. But to love what is good, sincere, and just, and from love to will it, is from the Lord alone. Therefore to fulfill the law is to be led by the Lord. But this will be more fully illustrated in what follows. [6] (3) “Without the fulfilling of the law there is no salvation.” This involves that if man were able to fulfill the law of himself he would be saved, which yet in itself is false; and since it is false, and yet appears as if true because it is a received dogma, it must be confirmed by reasonings from the natural man. That it is false is clear from this, that man is unable to do anything good from self, but everything good is from the Lord; also from this, that no such state of integrity is possible that any good that is in itself good can be from man and be done by man, as has been said above respecting Adam. And as such a state of integrity never did and never can exist, it follows that the law must be fulfilled by the Lord, according to what has just been said above. Nevertheless, he who does not believe that man must do everything as of himself, although he does it from the Lord, is much deceived. [7] (4) “The Lord came into the world that He might fulfill the law, and thus His righteousness and merit might be imputed to man; and by that imputation man is loosed from the yoke of the law, even to the extent that after justification by faith alone nothing condemns him.” This, too, is reasoning from the natural man. It was not for this that the Lord came into the world, but that He might effect a judgment, and thereby reduce to order all things in the heavens and in the hells, and at the same time glorify His Human. By this have been saved, and are still saved all who have"

For the Lord teaches: I came not to destroy the law and the prophets;2 I came not to destroy but to fulfill. Whosoever shall break the least of these commandments, and shall teach men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of the heavens; but whosoever doeth and teacheth them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of the heavens (Matt. 5:17, 19, seq.). [8] (5) “Man accepts the imputation of the Lord’s merit by faith alone, and not at all by works.” This is a conclusion deduced from the reasonings that precede; and as those reasonings are from the natural man, and not from the rational enlightened by the spiritual, and consequently are from falsities and not from truths, it follows that the conclusion drawn from them falls to the ground. From this it can be seen that to confirm any principle that is in itself false there must be reasonings from the natural man, and confirmations from the sense of the letter of the Word, for reasonings will give an appearance of consistency to passages selected from the sense of the letter of the Word. This is why reasonings from the natural man are signified by “the beast out of the sea,” and confirmations from the sense of the letter of the Word by “the beast coming up out of the earth.” 775. Having seven heads, signifies the knowledge (scientia) of the holy things of the Word which are falsified and adulterated. This is evident from the signification of “head,” as being intelligence and wisdom, and in the contrary sense, insanity and folly (see above, n. 573, 577). And as intelligence and wisdom cannot be predicated of those who by reasonings from the natural man confirm the separation of faith and life, who are meant by “the beast coming up out of the sea,” so “its head” signifies knowledge. It means the knowledge of the holy things of the Word, because there were “seven heads,” and seven is predicated of things holy (see above, n. 257). The knowledge of the holy things of the Word is meant, because those meant by “the dragon” are not opposed to the Word; for they call the Word holy and Divine, because they collect from it"

But that they falsify and adulterate by these the holy things of the Word, of which they have knowledge, will be evident from what follows, and is evident in general from this, that those who separate faith from life cannot do otherwise, since such a separation is contrary to each and all things of the Word. For in all things of the Word and in every particular of it there is a marriage of good and truth, as is manifestly evident from the spiritual sense of the Word. This is why there are in so many passages two expressions that appear like repetitions of the same thing, but still one of them has reference to good and the other to truth; thus the two make as it were a marriage, which is called the Divine marriage, the celestial marriage, and the spiritual marriage, which regarded in itself is the marriage of good and truth. (Respecting this marriage see above, n. 238, 288b, 484, 660.) There must be a like marriage of faith and love, or of faith and good works; for faith pertains to truth, and truth to faith; and love pertains to good, and good to love. From this it is clear that those who separate faith from its life, or what is the same, from love, cannot do otherwise than falsify the Word, because they explain the sense of its letter in opposition to the marriage of good and truth which is in each and every thing of the Word. [2] It has been said that the “head” signifies wisdom and intelligence, and that with those who are not in wisdom and intelligence it signifies knowledge (scientia); therefore with those who falsify and pervert the Word it signifies insanity and folly, as above (n. 715), where the signification of “the seven heads of the dragon” was explained; so “the head of this beast” has a similar signification, since this beast means the dragon in reference to reasonings from the natural man confirming the separation of faith from the life. The “head” signifies wisdom, intelligence, and the knowledge of truths, and in the contrary sense folly, insanity, and the knowledge of falsities, because these have their seat in the head, and are there in their beginnings. This is clearly evident from the fact that the origins of all fibers are in the head, and from it they proceed to all the organs of sense and motion belonging to the face and the whole body; and there, too, are substances in infinite number that look like little spheres and are called by anatomists the cortical and cineritious substances; and from these go forth small"

From this medullary substance discernible fibers extend, and these when conjoined are called nerves. By these the cerebrum, the cerebellum, and the spinal marrow form the entire body and each and all things pertaining to it; and from this it comes that each and all things of the body are ruled by the brains. [3] From this it can be seen that the brains are the seat of the understanding and the will, which are called with one term, mind, and in consequence, of intelligence and wisdom, and that these are there in their first principles; also that the organs that are formed to receive sensations and to produce motions are derivations therefrom, precisely like streams from their fountains, or derivatives from their beginnings, or composite things from their substances; and these derivations are such that the brains are everywhere present, almost as the sun is present by its light and heat in each and all things of the earth. From this it follows that the whole body, and each and all things of it, are forms that are under the observation, auspices, and obedience, of the mind, which is in the brain; thus these forms are so constructed after the mind’s direction that any part in which the mind is not present, or to which it does not communicate its life, is no part of man’s life. From this it can be seen that when the mind is in its thought, which pertains to the understanding, and in its affection, which pertains to the will, it has an extension into every particular of the whole body, and there, by means of its forms, it spreads itself out as the thoughts and affections of the angels do into the societies of the universal heaven. The like is true here, since all things of the human body correspond to all things of heaven; consequently the form of the whole heaven before the Lord is the human form. (This is treated of at length in the Arcana Coelestia and in the work on Heaven and Hell. ) [4] This has been said to make known why the “head” signifies wisdom and intelligence, as also in the contrary sense folly and insanity. For such as man is in his beginnings such is he in the whole, for the body with each and every part of it is a derivation, as has just been said. If, therefore, the mind is in the belief of falsity"

This is also clearly evident when man becomes a spirit, whether good or evil; then his whole spiritual body, from head to foot, is wholly such as his mind is. If the mind is heavenly, the whole spirit, even as to its body, is heavenly. If the mind is infernal, the whole spirit, even as to its body, is infernal; and in consequence such a spirit appears in a direful form like a devil, while the former spirit appears in a beautiful form like an angel of heaven. But on this more will be said elsewhere. 776. And ten horns, signifies much power. This is evident from what has been stated above (n. 716), where “the dragon” that had “ten horns” was treated of. That much power which is attributed to the dragon and to this beast, is represented in the spiritual world by horns, and was therefore representatively exhibited to John as horns upon the beast of the dragon, is the power of reasonings by fallacies, thus by falsities, from the natural man. Such reasonings indeed have no real power in themselves, for all power belongs to truths; nevertheless, falsities from the fallacies of the senses and reasonings from these do have much power with men on earth before they are in truths from good, that is, before they have been regenerated by the Lord. For man from birth is in evils, and also in falsities therefrom; since falsities gush forth from evils like impure waters from an impure fountain; and those falsities when confirmed by reasonings from the fallacies of the senses appear like truths. And as man is from birth in falsities from evils he easily appropriates, acknowledges, and believes them, for they are in agreement with his first natural light and with the heat of that light, which is from the fire of the love of self or of the love of the world. And since man is easily, and as it were spontaneously, carried away to believe such things, and is thus misled, therefore much power is attributed here to the beast, and above to the dragon. But over the man who is in truths from good, or over one who is regenerated by the Lord, they have no power; and in every case they have less power in proportion as truths are multiplied with man, and finally none at all; for, as has been said above, all power is in truths from good, consequently there is none in falsities from evil."

In certain places there those who are in falsities are continually contending with those who are like them and with those who are unlike them; and it was seen that the evil conquered by means of falsities, and drew a great many over to their side. When I wondered at this it was said and perceived that falsities have power over those who are in falsities; for it was observed that those who were conquered and thus drawn over were equally in falsities; and conversely, that falsities have no power over those who are in truths. It was further seen that those who were in falsities fought also with those who were in truths, and conquered them also; but still it was perceived that these were not in truths from good, but in truths without good. But when those who are in falsities fight against those who are in truths from good they have no effect whatever; they are like chaff in the air that is dispersed and scattered in every direction by a man’s breath, with no power of resistance. Thence it is clear why the evil are sometimes called in the Word “mighty and powerful.” From this it is now evident why “ten horns” were seen upon the head of the dragon and upon the head of this beast, and likewise upon the head of the scarlet beast (Rev. 17:3). 777. And upon his horns ten diadems, signifies power from appearances of truth in abundance. This is evident from the signification of “horns,” as being power (of which just above); also from the signification of “ten,” as being much, thus also abundance (see above, n. 675); also from the signification of “diadems,” as being truths in the ultimate of order, which are the truths of the sense of the letter of the Word (see above, n. 717). Appearances of truth are also meant, because the truths of the sense of the letter of the Word are for the most part appearances of truth; and by means of these apparent truths of the Word those who are meant by this “beast” have their power. These are such as confirm by reasonings the separation of faith from life. For the truths of the sense of the letter of the Word, which are appearances of truth, and which they connect by reasonings so as to make them to appear like genuine truths, are what are here signified by “diadems.” But when these have been connected by reasonings from falsities and fallacies they are no longer apparent truths but truths falsified, and thus falsities;"

As this is among the chief things of the doctrine of those who separate faith from its life, which is charity, I will state briefly how the Divine is thereby blasphemed. It is blasphemed by this, that they believe and think that the Divine removed or rejected the human race from itself, when yet God is love itself, mercy itself, and goodness itself, and these are His Esse; evidently, therefore, it is impossible for God to remove or reject a single one of the human race, for this would be to act against His own Esse, which, as has been said, is the source of all love, all mercy, and all good. It would be impossible even for any angel or any man who is in love, mercy, and good from the Lord, to do this; and yet their love is finite, while the Divine love is infinite. God the Father’s removing or rejecting the human race they call vindictive justice, of which they cherish no other idea than that of a king or judge avenging an evil done to him, consequently that it is like their vengeance, in which there cannot but be something of anger. To confirm this they cite passages from the Word where God is called an avenger, a revenger, jealous, angry, wrathful; and these passages of the Word they thus falsify, since these expressions are used in the sense of the letter of the Word according to appearances. For when a man after death becomes a spirit, if he is in evils from his life in the world he turns himself away from the Lord; and when he turns himself away from the Lord and denies Him he can no longer be so under the Lord’s protection that his evil does not punish him, for the punishment of evil is in the evil, as the reward of good is in the good. But because the punishment of evil by the evil, or by those who are evil, appears as if it were punishment by the Divine, so from that appearance the Divine is said in the Word to be angry, to condemn, to cast into hell, and the like. Yet the Lord condemns and punishes no one (as can be seen in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 545–550, under the head, “The Lord casts no one down into Hell, but the spirit casts himself down”). From this can be seen how the Divine is blasphemed by the falsification of the Word. For it is thought that God is in some respect an avenger, or revenger, that He is angry,"

The Divine is blasphemed by the falsification of the Word also by their believing and thinking that God the Father wished to be reconciled to the human race by the punishment of extreme condemnation, which was the passion of the cross, thus by the blood of His Son; and that by this He was moved and is moved to mercy. Who that has an enlightened understanding does not see that this, too, is contrary to the Divine, and therefore contrary to the genuine truth of the Word? For as what is contrary to the Divine is blasphemy, so to wrest the sense of the letter of the Word to confirm this doctrine is blas-phemy. But more about this in what follows. 778b. [3] What, then, is signified by “blasphemy” can be seen from passages in the Word where it is mentioned; from which I am only allowed to cite the following. In the Gospels: Jesus said, Every sin and blasphemy shall be remitted unto men, but the blasphemy of the Spirit shall not be remitted unto men. And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man it shall be remitted unto him, but whosoever shall speak against the Holy Spirit it shall not be remitted unto him, neither in this age nor in that which is to come (Matt. 12:31, 32). I say unto you, All sins shall be remitted unto the sons of man. But whosoever shall blaspheme against the Spirit hath no remission to eternity, but shall be subject to an eternal judgment (Mark 3:28, 29). Everyone who shall speak a word against the Son of man it shall be remitted unto him, but unto him that blasphemeth the Holy Spirit it shall not be remitted (Luke 12:10). What is signified by “sin and blasphemy against the Holy Spirit,” and what by “a word against the Son of man,” has not hitherto been known in the church, and for the reason that it has not been known what is properly meant by “the Holy Spirit,” and what by “the Son of man.” “The Holy Spirit” means the Lord in relation to Divine truth such as it is in the heavens, that is, the Word such as it is in the spiritual sense, for this is Divine truth in heaven.

When it is known what is meant by “the Holy Spirit,” and what by “the Son of man,” it can also be known what is signified by “sin and blasphemy against the Holy Spirit,” and by “a word against the Son of man;” also why “a word against the Son of man” can be remitted, and “sin and blasphemy against the Holy Spirit” cannot. “Sin and blasphemy against the Holy Spirit” means to deny the Word, and to adulterate its essential goods and falsify its essential truths; while “a word against the Son of man” means to interpret the natural sense of the Word, which is the sense of its letter, according to appearances. [4] To deny the Word is a sin that “cannot be remitted in this age nor in that which is to come,” that is, to eternity, and he who does it “is subject to an eternal judgment,” because those who deny the Word deny God, deny the Lord, deny heaven and hell, and deny the church and all things pertaining to it; and those who deny these are atheists, who, although with their lips they attribute the creation of the universe to some Supreme Entity, or Deity, or God, yet in heart ascribe it to nature. Because such by denial have dissolved all bond of connection with the Lord they must needs be separated from heaven and conjoined to hell. To adulterate the essential goods of the Word and to falsify its essential truths is blasphemy against the Holy Spirit that cannot be remitted, because “the Holy Spirit” means the Lord in relation to Divine truth such as it is in the heavens, that is, the Word such as it is in the spiritual sense, as has been said above. In the spiritual sense are genuine goods and genuine truths; but in the natural sense these same are as it were clothed, and only here and there are naked. They are therefore called apparent goods and truths. These are what are adulterated and falfied; and they are said to be adulterated and falsified when they are so explained as to be contrary to genuine goods and truths, for heaven then removes itself and man is separated from it; and for the reason, as has been said, that genuine goods and truths constitute the spiritual sense of the Word in which the angels of heaven are. For example, heaven is removed from man when the Lord and His Divine are denied, as was done by the Pharisees who said that the Lord wrought miracles by Beelzebub and had an unclean spirit; and because they thus denied"

For the same reason also the Socinians and Arians, who deny the Divine of the Lord, although they do not deny the Lord, are out of heaven, and cannot be received by any angelic society. [5] Take, as another example, those who exclude the goods of love and the works of charity from among the means of salvation, and who claim that faith, exclusive of these, is the sole means of salvation, and who confirm this opinion not only by doctrine but also by their life, saying in heart, Goods do not save me nor evils condemn, because I have faith. Such also blaspheme the Holy Spirit, for they falsify the genuine good and truth of the Word, and this in a thousand passages, where love and charity and deeds and works are mentioned. Moreover, as has been said above, in each and every thing of the Word there is the marriage of good and truth, thus of charity and faith; consequently when good or charity is taken away that marriage perishes, and instead there is adultery; the nature of this adultery will be explained elsewhere. This is why these, too, cannot be received into heaven; and for the further reason that they have put earthly love in place of heavenly love and evil works in place of good works, because their works are from earthly love, and when this is separated from heavenly love it is infernal love. But it is otherwise with those who believe, indeed, from the doctrine of the church and from their teachers, that faith is the only means of salvation, or who know this, but inwardly neither affirm it nor deny it, and who, nevertheless, live a good life from the Word, that is, because the Lord has so commanded in the Word. Such do not blaspheme the Holy Spirit, for they do not adulterate the goods of the Word nor falsify its truths, wherefore they have conjunction with the angels of heaven. Moreover, few of such know that faith is anything else than believing in the Word. The dogma of justification by faith alone without the works of the law they do not apprehend because it transcends their understanding.

Let it be noted that the good of the Word when adulterated is evil, and that its truth when falsified is falsity. 778c. A word against the Son of man, signifies to interpret the natural sense of the Word, which is the sense of its letter, according to appearances, because the Son of man means the Lord in relation to Divine truth such as it is on earth, thus such as it is in the natural sense. Such a word is remitted unto men, because most things in the natural sense of the Word, or the sense of its letter, are goods and truths clothed, and some only are naked, as they are in the spiritual sense; and goods and truths that are clothed are called appearances of truth. For the Word in its ultimates is like a man clothed with a garment, but with his face and hands naked; and where the Word is thus naked its goods and truths appear naked, as they do in heaven, thus such as they are in the spiritual sense. There is, therefore, nothing to hinder those who are enlightened by the Lord from seeing, or to hinder those who are not so enlightened from confirming, the doctrine of genuine good and genuine truth from the sense of the letter of the Word. The Word is such in the sense of the letter that it may be a basis for the spiritual sense; thus, too, it is accommodated to the comprehension of the simple, who, unless things are so stated, are unable to perceive them, and when perceived, to believe and do them. [7] Moreover, because the Divine truths in the sense of the letter of the Word are for the most part appearances of truth, and the simple in faith and heart cannot be raised above them, it is not sin or blasphemy to interpret the Word according to appearances, provided principles are not formed from these appearances and so confirmed as to destroy Divine truth in its genuine sense. For example, where it is said: Behold the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sin of the world (John 1:29); and:"

And they overcame him through the blood of the Lamb (Rev. 12:7, 11); and when from these words it is believed in simplicity that the Lord suffered the passion of the cross on account of our sins, and that through this suffering and His blood He redeemed us from hell—since this is an apparent truth, and can be stated and believed, therefore it does not condemn the simple in faith and heart. But to establish a principle from these words, and to confirm that principle so far as to hold that God the Father was and is in this way reconciled to man, and that man is justified and saved by his faith alone without the good things of charity, which are good works, and to be in that principle in life as well as in doctrine—this cannot be remitted. [8] From this it can be seen that “blasphemy against the Holy Spirit” signifies the falsification of the Word even to the destruction of Divine truth in its genuine sense. Therefore “a name of blasphemy” signifies the falsification of Divine truth, thus of the Word, because it is called blasphemy when anyone speaks against God; and to speak against God is to speak against the Divine truth, for the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord is what is meant in the Word by “God;” and Divine good is meant by “Jehovah,” and by “the Lord.” And as it is blasphemy to speak against God, thus also against the Word, since the Word is Divine truth, it follows that blasphemy is to falsify the Word. For those who falsify the Word make its truth to be falsity, and falsity continually speaks against truth, and even assaults it. This is why “blasphemy” signifies the falsification of the Word, even to the destruction of its genuine good and genuine truth.

[10] That “blasphemies” signify to believe and speak wickedly and falsely about God and about Divine truth can also be seen from other passages in the Word. As in Isaiah: Jehovah said, Fear not on account of the words which thou hast heard, wherewith the young men of the king of Assyria have blasphemed Me. And Hezekiah the king prayed, and said, Hear, O Jehovah, all the words of Sennacherib, who hath sent to blaspheme the living God. And Jehovah spake concerning him, Whom hast thou blasphemed and reviled, and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice and lifted up thine eyes on high? Against the Holy One of Israel! By the hand of thy servants thou hast blasphemed the Lord (37:6, 15, 17, 23, 24). From this, too, it can be seen that blasphemy is predicated of false speaking against God. For “the king of Assyria,” who at that time was Sennacherib, signifies the rational, but here the rational perverted, which speaks against Divine truth, treats it shamefully, and censures it by falsities; and this is to falsify it, as has been said above. The falsities spoken against Divine truth are signified by the things mentioned in verses 10–13, 24, 25, which were all not only blasphemies against God but also falsifications of Divine truth. [11] In Moses: As to the soul that doeth with a high hand, the same blasphemeth Jehovah, in that he hath despised the word of Jehovah and hath rendered void His commandment, that soul shall be utterly cut off, its iniquity shall be upon it (Num. 15:30, 31). This treats of those who act against the commandments of God given through Moses, both through error, and also from purpose (as is clear from verse 23 and those that follow in that chapter); here those who so act from purpose are treated of, and this is meant by “doing with a high hand.” And since to act against a commandment is to act against Divine truth, and to act against this"

[12] That blasphemy is predicated of evil speaking and false speaking about God, and thus about Divine truth, it is unnecessary to confirm here by many passages from the Word; not only because anyone can see that blasphemy is nothing else in the spiritual sense, but also because there are various kinds of it; consequently in human languages, as in the Hebrew, there are various terms by which the kinds of blasphemy of God and of the Divine truth are expressed, such as calumny, contumely, ignominy, opprobrium, reproach, rebuke, jesting, scoffing, mocking, and others, each of which is used in the Word with a generic and specific difference, to analyze and explain which would require many pages. 779.

Verse 2. And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, signifies reasonings that are discordant, and yet appear as if they cohere. This is evident from the signification of “a beast coming up out of the sea,” which is here treated of, as being reasonings from the natural man confirming the separation of faith from life (see above, n. 774), so here it means such reasonings; also from the signification of a “leopard,” as being reasonings that are discordant"

[2] As this is the signification of the “leopard,” I will first illustrate by some examples how those who separate faith from its life, which is good works, make things that are discordant to appear by their reasonings to be coherent. In many passages of the Word heresies are represented by “idols” which the workman forms by various means until he makes them appear in the figure of a man, and yet no life can be imparted to them so that they may see, hear, move the hands and feet, and speak. This I have also seen done in the spiritual world by some who had separated faith from good works; and this work continued for many hours; and when the idol had been made it appeared the sight of many like an image of a man, but before the eyes of angels like a monster. Moreover, they wished to impart to it something of life by means of their arts; but this they were unable to do. [3] Such things take place in the spiritual world, because all things that are seen in that world are representative of spiritual things, which are presented in such forms as exist in this world; consequently beasts of the earth of every kind and birds of heaven are seen there; also houses and apartments in them, with various decorations, likewise gardens and paradises full of trees bearing fruits and flowers, also tables are seen and eatables of every kind upon them, with innumerable other things, which, however, are all from a spiritual origin, and are therefore representative of spiritual things. For the same reason some there form various things by means of which spiritual things are presented in effigy.

(That this is so can be seen from many things in the work on Heaven and Hell, especially in n. 460.) That “idols” signify in the Word false doctrinals from self-intelligence that appear as truths, can be seen above (n. 587). This has been said to make known that upon all heresies, and especially upon this universal one of the separation of faith from good works, an appearance can be induced by reasonings as if they were from truths and not from falsities. [4] But this shall be illustrated by an example. Who may not be brought to believe that faith alone is the only means of salvation, since man is unable to do good of himself which is good in itself? For this appears to everyone at first sight as a consequence, and thus to agree with truth; and it is not then recognized to be a reasoning from the natural man confirming the separation of faith from good works; and when a man has been persuaded by this reasoning he thinks that there is no need to attend to his life, because he has faith. But he who is in this persuasion is not aware that to do good from the Word, that is, because it is commanded in the Word, is to do good from the Lord, and that thus a man may do good from himself, and yet may believe that it is from the Lord. But about this more will be said in what follows. From this much it can be seen how the appearance can easily be induced by reasonings that this falsity which universally prevails in the Christian Church is in agreement with this truth, that every good that is good in itself is from the Lord, and not at all from man, from which it is inferred that a man can cease doing good and yet be saved; when in fact, this is altogether in disagreement with the truth. 780b.

As both of these are against good it is said, “Then may ye also do good who have been taught to do evil.” It is said that both are against good, namely, evil and the falsity of evil, because evil of the will and falsity of the understanding therefrom are meant. Evil of the will is evil from one’s nature, and falsity of the understanding becomes evil by act; for the will acts and does evil by means of the understanding. [6] In Isaiah: Righteousness shall be the girdle of His loins, and truth the girdle of His hips; therefore the wolf shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard with the kid, the calf and the young lion and the fatling together, and a little boy shall lead them (11:5, 6). This is said of the Lord and of His kingdom, and of the state of innocence and peace therein.

But what pertaining to heaven or to hell is signified can be best known from representatives in the spiritual world, where also beasts appear, all of which are appearances representing such things as angels or spirits are thinking from their affections, inclinations, appetites, pleasures, and desires. These things are presented before their eyes in various forms, as gardens, forests, fields, plains, and also fountains; likewise palaces and houses, and chambers therein, in which are decorative and useful things; also tables are seen upon which are various kinds of food. They are also exhibited in the forms of animals of the earth, the flying things of heaven, and creeping things, in an infinite variety; not only in the forms of such animals and flying things as are upon our earth, but in forms composite from several forms, which nowhere exist on earth, many of which it has been granted me to see. When these appear, their spiritual origin and thus what they signify is at once known. But as soon as the spirit or angel ceases from his thought and meditation these animals and birds instantly vanish. [3] That such things are seen in the spiritual world is clearly evident from like things seen by the prophets as that the Lord appeared like a Lamb; cherubs were seen with faces like a lion, an ox, and an eagle (described in Ezekiel); horses were seen going forth out of the book of life when the Lamb opened its seals, also a white horse, and also many white horses upon which those in heaven rode (in John); also white, bay, red, black, and grisled horses (in Zechariah); there was also seen a red dragon having many heads and horns; and now here was seen a beast like a leopard, with the feet of a bear and the mouth of a lion; also another beast having two horns like a lamb, and afterwards a scarlet beast upon which sat a woman.

From this it is clear not only that such beasts appear in the spiritual world, but also that they are significative; and from this it can also be seen that all the beasts as well as all the birds mentioned in the Word are significative of such things as are represented by beasts in the spiritual world. But what is signified by “the bear” will be told in what follows. 781b. [4] Before this is shown from the Word I will illustrate by some examples what is meant by the fallacies that are here signified by “the feet as of a bear.” The many things that man reasons and forms conclusions about from the natural man without spiritual light, that is, without the light of the understanding enlightened by the Lord, are called fallacies, for the natural man takes the ideas of his thought from earthly, corporeal, and worldly things, which in themselves are material; and when a man’s thought is not elevated above these he thinks materially about things spiritual; and material thought without spiritual light derives everything from the loves of the natural man and from their delights, which are contrary to heavenly loves and their delights. This is why conclusions and reasonings from the natural man alone and its delusive lumen are fallacies. But let this be illustrated by examples. [5] It is a fallacy that cogitative faith saves, since man is such as his life is. It is a fallacy that cogitative faith is spiritual, since to love the Lord above all things and the neighbor as oneself is the spiritual itself, and to love is to will and do. It is a fallacy that faith can also be given in a moment, since man must be purified from evils and from falsities therefrom and be regenerated by the Lord, and this is a long-continued process, and only so far as man is purified and regenerated does he receive spiritual faith. It is a fallacy that man can receive faith and be saved at the hour of death whatever his life may have been, since a man’s life remains and he is judged according to his deeds and works. [6] It is a fallacy that little children also have faith through baptism, since faith must be acquired through the knowledges of truth and good, and by a life in accordance with them. It is a fallacy"

It is a fallacy that man is justified by faith alone, and that the merit of the Lord is thereby imputed to him when he is justified, and that afterwards nothing condemns him, since faith without the life of faith, which is charity, is like something that is said to be living but has no soul, which in itself is dead; for charity is the soul of faith, because it is its life; consequently man is not justified by a dead faith, much less is the merit of the Lord imputed and salvation effected by it; and where there is no salvation there is condemnation. [7] It is a fallacy that in faith alone, there is love and charity, since love and charity are willing and doing, for what a man loves he not only thinks but also wills and does. It is a fallacy that where “doing” and “deeds” and “works” are mentioned in the Word to have faith is meant, because these are present in faith, since these are as distinct as thought and will are; for a man can think many things that he does not will, while what he wills he thinks when left alone to himself; and to will is to do. Moreover, the will and the thought therefrom are the man himself, and not the thought separate; and deeds and works are of the will and of the thought therefrom; while faith alone is of the thought separate from deeds and works, which are of the will. [8] It is a fallacy that faith is to be separated from good works because man is unable to do good of himself, and if he does good he places merit in it, since man when he does good from the Word does not do it from himself but from the Lord, because the Lord is in the Word and is the Word; and man then does not do good of himself, when he does it as of himself and yet believes that he does it from the Lord, because from the Word; moreover, when a man believes that the good that he does is from the Lord he cannot place merit in the deeds.

This is the source of all heretical beliefs. [9] It is a fallacy that the confidence that is called saving faith, accepted without understanding, is spiritual confidence, since confidence apart from understanding is a persuasion from another, or from confirmation by passages gathered up here and there from the Word, and applied by reasonings from the natural man to a false principle. Such confidence is a blind faith, which is merely natural because it does not see whether a thing is true or false. Moreover, all truth wishes to be seen because it belongs to the light of heaven; but truth that is not seen may be falsified in many ways; and falsified truth is falsity. [10] Such are the fallacies that pertain merely to such faith as is separated from good works. There are yet many others that pertain not only to faith but also to good works, to charity, and to the neighbor, and especially to such conjunctions of these with faith as are skillfully adjusted by the learned. Such fallacies are signified by “the feet of a bear,” because a “bear” signifies those, both the well- disposed and the evil, who have power from the natural sense of the Word. And as “feet” signify things natural, “the feet of the bear” signify the fallacies from which the sense of the letter of the Word is falsified by reasonings, and into which the appearances of truth of that sense are changed. 781c. [11] That a “bear” signifies power from the natural sense of the Word, both with the well-disposed and with the evil, can be seen from the following passages. In the second book of Kings: When Elisha went up to Bethel, as he was going up in the way there came forth boys out of the city and mocked him, and said unto him, Go up thou baldhead, go up thou baldhead. And he looked behind him and saw them, and cursed them in the name of Jehovah; and there came forth two she-bears out of the forest, and tare in pieces forty-two boys (2:23, 24)."

This evidently was not done by Elisha from unrestrained anger and without just cause, for he could not have been so cruel merely because the little boys said, “Go up thou baldhead.” This was indeed, an insult to the prophet, but not a sufficient reason for their being therefore torn to pieces by bears. But this was done because Elisha represented the Lord in respect to the Word, thus the Word that is from the Lord. “Baldhead” signified the Word deprived of the natural sense, which is the sense of its letter; and “bears out of the forest” signified power from the natural sense or sense of the letter of the Word, as has been said above; and these “boys” signified such as blaspheme the Word because its natural sense is such as it is; and “forty-two” signifies blasphemy. From this it is clear that this represented and thence signified the punishment for blaspheming the Word. For all the power and sanctity of the Word are gathered up and have their seat in the sense of its letter; for without this sense the Word could not exist, since without it the Word would be like a house without a foundation, which would be shaken by the wind, and thus be overthrown and fall to pieces. The Word would also be like a man without a skin, which surrounds and holds the enclosed viscera in their position and order. And as this is the signification of “baldness,” and “Elisha” represented the Word, the boys were torn in pieces by bears which signifies the power from the natural sense of the Word, which is the sense of the letter, both with the well- disposed and with the evil. From this it is clear that the historical things of the Word, as well as its prophecies, contain a spiritual sense. [12] The bear that David smote has a like signification; this is described in the first book of Samuel: David said unto Saul, Thy servant was pasturing his father’s flock, and there came a lion and a bear and took away a sheep from the flock; I went out after him and smote him; and when he arose against me I took hold of his beard and smote him and killed him. Thy servant smote both the lion and the bear. Therefore this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, because he hath reproached the ranks of the living God (17:34–37)."

But “a sheep from the flock” signifies those who are of the Lord’s church. And as this was represented, the power was given to David to smite the bear and the lion, to represent and signify the Lord’s power to defend by His Divine truth His own in the church from the falsities of evil that are from hell. David’s taking hold of the beard of the bear involves an arcanum that may be disclosed, indeed, but can scarcely be comprehended. The “beard” signifies the Divine truth in ultimates, in which its essential power rests. This truth also the evil who are in falsities carry indeed in the mouth but they misuse it to destroy; but when it is taken away they no longer have any power. This is why he killed the bear and smote the lion. But this will be further explained elsewhere. But “Goliath,” who was a Philistine and was therefore called “uncircumcised,” signifies such as are in truths without good; and truths without good are truths falsified, which in themselves are falsities. “The uncircumcised” signifies those who are in filthy corporeal loves; for the foreskin corresponds to those loves. From this it is clear what the victory of David over Goliath represented. From this it can be seen why: David is compared by Hushai to a bear bereaved in the field (2 Sam. 17:8). 781d. [13] In Daniel: Another beast coming up out of the sea was like to a bear, and it raised itself upon its side, and three ribs were in its mouth between its teeth; and they said unto it, Arise, devour much flesh (7:5). The four beasts coming up out of the sea depict the successive states of the church, even to its devastation, which is its end.

The eagerness to falsify its goods is signified by “raising itself upon one side.” The “three ribs in the mouth between the teeth” signify the knowledges of truth from the Word in abundance, which are perverted by reasonings from fallacies; and “to devour much flesh” signifies the destruction of good by falsities, and the appropriation of evil. [14] In Hosea: I am become to them as a lion, as a leopard will I watch over the way; I will meet them as a bear that is bereaved; and there I will devour as a huge lion; the wild beast of the field shall rend them (13:7, 8). The signification of the words, “I am become to them as a lion, as a leopard will I watch over the way,” was explained in the preceding article. “To meet them as a bear that is bereaved” signifies the falsification of the sense of the letter of the Word; “to devour as a huge lion” signifies the destruction and devastation of every truth of the Word, and thence of the church; “the wild beast of the field shall rend them” signifies that they will be destroyed by the falsities from evil. [15] In Lamentations: Although I cry out and shout he shutteth out my prayers, he hath hedged about my ways with hewn stone, he hath overturned my footpaths; a bear lying in wait for me, a lion in secret places, he hath perverted my ways, he hath made me desolate (3:8–11). This is a lamentation from God respecting the desolation of truth in the church; and that they cannot be heard by reason of falsities is signified by “Although I cry out and shout he shutteth out my prayers.” That falsities from self-intelligence turn away and reject the influx of truth is signified by “he hath hedged about my ways with hewn stone, he hath overturned my footpaths;” God’s “ways and footpaths” signifying truths leading to good, and “hewn stone” what belongs to self-intelligence. Because this was the signification of “hewn stone” it was forbidden to build an altar of hewn stones, and likewise the temple at Jerusalem. “A bear lying in wait for me” signifies the natural man perverting the sense of the letter of the"

[16] In Amos: Woe unto you that desire the day of Jehovah. What to you is the day of Jehovah? It is a day of darkness and not of light; as one who fleeth from a lion and meeteth a bear, or who cometh to a house and leaneth with his hand upon the wall and a serpent biteth him (5:18, 19). “The day of Jehovah” means the coming of the Lord, who is the Messiah whom they expected; and as they believed that He would deliver them from the enemies of the land, and would exalt them in glory above all the nations, they desired Him. But as the Lord came into the world not for the sake of any kingdom on earth but for the sake of a kingdom in heaven, and as the Jewish nation was in the falsities of evil, and these were at that time manifested, it is said, “Woe unto you that desire the day of Jehovah. What to you is the day of Jehovah? It is a day of darkness and not of light,” “darkness and not light” meaning the falsities in which they were; “as one who fleeth from a lion meeteth a bear” signifies fear because of the dominion of falsity when truths are sought from the sense of the letter of the Word, which they cannot but falsify; for one is said “to flee from a lion and to meet a bear” when he is interiorly in falsity from evil, and is led to investigate truths from the sense of the letter of the Word, which he then, because of the interior dominion of falsity from evil, cannot but pervert; “who cometh to a house and leaneth with his hand upon a wall and a serpent biteth him” signifies that when such a man in seeking goods consults the Word in the sense of the letter he does not see that evils pervert it; “the bite of a serpent” signifying falsification, here the falsification that arises from the interior dominion of falsity from evil.

[19] From this it can now be seen that a “bear” signifies the natural man in respect to its power from the sense of the letter of the Word, in both senses, also in respect to the eagerness to falsify that sense. That this is what a “bear” signifies has been made evident to me by the bears seen in the spiritual world, in whose form the thoughts of those were represented who had been natural, and had studied the Word, and had wished to prevail by means of knowledge therefrom. Bears were also seen that had ribs between their teeth, like the bear described in the passage cited above from Daniel; and it was given to understand that the ribs represented the knowledges that they had drawn from the Word while in the world. White bears also appear there, which represent the power of the spiritual-natural man through the Word. Furthermore, composite beasts appear there of bears, panthers, wolves, and oxen, also the same furnished with wings, which are all significative of persons of such character when they are passing along in meditation. 782.

This is because a “lion” signifies the Divine truth, for which reason the Lord also is called “a lion” in the Word; consequently in the contrary sense a “lion” signifies infernal falsity in respect to its power to destroy divine truth, and thus the Word; and this is especially done by adulterations and falsifications of it. And as a lion is the most powerful of animals, and its power increases according to its hunger to devour and consequently to seize its prey and tear it in pieces, so a “lion” signifies also the eagerness to destroy the truths of the Word. “Lions” have a like representation in the spiritual world, for lions also appear there, but the forms of lions are appearances arising"

This is why “lions” signify in the Word in the contrary sense infernal falsity destroying the truths of the church. Because this is what a “lion” signifies, and because “the beast that was like unto a leopard” and that “had feet as of a bear” signifies the reasonings confirming the separation of faith from life, by which the goods and truths of the Word are adulterated and falsified; therefore the “mouth” of that beast, which was “as the mouth of a lion,” signifies reasoning from falsities that destroy the truths of the Word. The “mouth,” in a strict sense, signifies thought; but as man’s speech is from the mouth, the “mouth” signifies the various things that flow from thought, as instruction, preaching, reasoning; here reasoning, because reasonings from the natural man are signified by the “beast” here treated of. But more will be said about this in the explanation of verses 5–7 of this chapter, in which are these words: “And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and there was given unto him authority to make war forty-two months. And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme His name and His tabernacle and them that dwell in heaven. And it was given unto him to make war with the saints and to overcome them.” From that explanation it will be seen what power and eagerness, and what ability such have to falsify the truths and adulterate the goods of the Word by means of reasonings. 783. And the dragon gave him his power and his throne and great authority, signifies that those who separate faith from life support and corroborate their doctrinals by reasonings from fallacies, and thus powerfully seduce. This is evident from the signification of the “beast” to which the dragon gave his powers, as being reasonings from the natural man confirming the separation of faith from life (see above, n. 774). These reasonings are from the fallacies of the senses, because that beast appeared like a leopard, and his feet were “as of a bear,” and “the feet of a bear” signify fallacies (see above, n. 781a, b).

That this is added to their reasonings and their fallacies has been shown above. [2] It is not because the falsities in which they are have any power in themselves that those who separate faith from life, that is, from good works, have “power, a throne, and great authority,” for falsities from evil have no power whatever, since all power is in truths from good. But falsities have power over falsities, as like over like. This can be clearly seen from the power of infernal spirits with one another, which they exercise by things imaginary and by semblances of correspondences, by which they are desirous of seeming most powerful and mighty; but yet they have no power whatever against truths, and so wholly none that it is nothing at all. This I could confirm by much experience were there space to digress so far in these explanations of Revelation. But this can be seen from the fact that the hells, in which there are myriads of myriads, are so held bound by Divine truth proceeding from the Lord, that no one in them dares raise up a finger of his hand; also from this fact that a single angel by means of truths from the Lord is able to lead, to control, to bind, or to scatter a thousand companies of evil spirits, and this merely by a look from an intention of the will. Such power also has been sometimes granted to me by the Lord. It may seem strange that the church at its end should be in falsities and in evils from them, and in evils and in falsities from them, and yet that truths from good have all power; and it seems as if such truths might be given by the Lord by means of truths from the Word. But the reason is that falsities have power against those who are in falsities from evil; and at the end of the church these falsities reign, and when these reign truths are not received. For this reason falsities cannot be dispersed by truths, and therefore the devil is then called powerful, and loosed from bonds. This is why infernal falsity is called in the Word a “lion,” a “bear,” a “wolf,” a “beast,” also a “wild beast” strong and fierce. [3] For the same reason those who are in falsities are called in the Word “powerful,” “vigorous,” “mighty,” “strong,” “heroes,” “rulers,” “terrible,” “dreadful,” and “wasters,” as can be seen from various passages, as from the following.

Some acquire for themselves power by simulated affections of good and truth and by the affections belonging to the love of what is sincere and just; by these they lead the simple good to feel well disposed towards them and to cherish good will towards them, and to join themselves to them. And so long as that kindly feeling continues to be mutual they continue more powerful than others. Some acquire for themselves power by representatives of various kinds, which are abuses of correspondences; and some in other ways. And as truths that are from good have all power, and these are found with angels, so nothing is more desired by evil spirits than to attract good spirits to their side, because thus the evil prevail; but as soon as they are separated from these they are in the falsities of their own evil, and when they are in these they are deprived of all power. [6] This, too, is why all the evil who flock out of this world are first separated from the goods and truths that they have merely known from memory, and thus carried in the mouth; and when they have been separated from these their interiors appear, which consist of nothing but masses of falsities from evils. And when they are in these, because they no longer have any power they fall down headlong into hell, as heavy bodies in the air fall to the earth. That goods and truths are taken away from the evil is known from the Word; for the Lord says: Take the talent from him and give it to him that hath the ten talents; for unto everyone that hath shall be given that he may have abundance, but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.

Verse 3. And I saw one of his heads as if it had been wounded to death, signifies the discordance of their doctrinals with the Word, in which “love,” “life,” and “works,” which do not at all agree with that religious principle, are so often mentioned. This is evident from the signification of the “heads” of that beast, as being the knowledge of the holy things of the Word which are falsified and adulterated (see above, n. 775). When the church and those of the church are treated of in the Word, “head” signifies intelligence and wisdom; and in the most universal sense the understanding of truth and the will of good. But as this treats of those who are not willing that the understanding should enter into the mysteries of faith, but who wish it to be held captive under obedience to their mysteries, and as these are described by “the dragon” and this his “beast,” it follows that the “head” of this beast signifies knowledge (scientia); for where the understanding does not see there is no intelligence, but in place of it knowledge. Moreover, intelligence cannot be predicated of those who are in falsities, but only knowledge (see about this in the New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine, n. 33). The above is evident also from the signification of “being wounded to death,” as being in disagreement with the Word; for doctrine which disagrees with the Word is dead; and this death is what is signified by “being wounded to death.” [2] The discordance is that they separate the life of love, which is good works, from faith, and make faith alone justifying and saving, and they take away everything of justification and salvation from the life of love or from good works; and as loving and doing are mentioned in the Word in a thousand passages, and it is declared"

From this it can be seen that the words, “I saw one of the heads of the beast as if it had been wounded to death,” signifies disagreement with the Word, in which “love,” “life,” and “works,” which do not at all agree with that religious principle, are so often mentioned. That they do not agree is clearly evident from the fact that it is a dogma of that religion that faith alone, without the works of the law, justifies and saves, yea, that if anything of salvation be placed in works it is damnable, because of man’s merit and what is his own (proprium) in them. For this reason many abstain from doing them, saying in their heart, Good works do not save me, and evil works do not damn me, because I have faith. From this principle they also assert that those are saved who about the hour of death declare with some confidence that they have faith, whatever their life may have been. But “deeds” and “works,” also “doing” and “loving,” are mentioned in the Word in a thousand passages, and as these disagree with that religious principle, therefore its dogmatists have devised means of conjoining them with faith. This, therefore, is the signification of the words “he saw one of the heads of the beast as if it had been wounded to death,” and “the stroke of his death was healed, and the whole earth wondered after the beast.” But how that stroke was healed, namely, by devised modes of conjunction, shall be said in the following article. [3] In the first place, some passages shall here be quoted from the Word where “deeds,” “works,” “doing,” and “working,” are mentioned, that everyone may see the discordance that is here signified by “one of the heads wounded to death;” also that this stroke is wholly incurable unless man lives according to the precepts of the Word by doing them.

[5] Moreover, the twelve disciples of the Lord represented the church in respect to all things of faith and charity in the complex; and of them, Peter, James, and John represented faith, charity, and good works in their order, Peter faith, James charity, and John good works; therefore the Lord said to Peter, when Peter saw John following the Lord: What is that to thee, Peter? Follow thou Me, John; for Peter said of John, What of him? (John 21:21, 22). This signifies that those who do good works must follow the Lord. Because John represented the church in respect to good works, he reclined at the Lord’s breast. That the church is with those who do good works is also signified by the Lord’s words from the cross to John: Jesus saw His mother, and spoke to the disciple whom He loved, who was standing by; and He said to His mother, Woman, behold thy son; and He said to that disciple, Behold thy mother; and from that hour that disciple took her unto himself (John 19:26, 27). This signifies that where good works are, there the church will be, for in the Word “woman,” like as “mother,” signifies the church.

Moreover, what is done is nothing but the will in act. Respecting love the Lord teaches in many passages (as in Matt. 5:43–48; 7:12; Luke 6:27–39, 43 to the end; 7:36 to the end; John 13:34, 35; 14:14–23; 15:9–19; 17:22–26; 21:15–23), and in brief in these words: Thou shalt love the Lord thy God in thy whole heart and from thy whole soul; this is the first and great commandment. The second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. On these two commandments hang the law and the prophets (Matt. 22:35–38, 40; Luke 10:27, 28; Deut. 6:5). “To love God above all things, and the neighbor as oneself,” is to do His commandments (John 14:21–24); and “the law and the prophets” signify the Word in all things and in every particular. From all these passages cited from the Word it is fully evident that it is not faith separated from good works that saves, but faith from good works and with them. For he who does good works has faith, but he who does them not has no faith. 786. And the stroke of his death was healed, signifies the discordance apparently cleared away by means of devised conjunctions of works with faith. This is evident from the signification of “the stroke of death,” as being discordance with the Word; for “stroke of death” has a like signification here as “the head wounded to death” just above. That “strokes” signify in the Word such things as destroy the church and the spiritual life of man may be seen above (n. 584); and as doctrine from the Word constitutes the church, so when doctrine disagrees with the Word there is no longer a church, but only a religion that counterfeits the church. The above is evident also from the signification of “being healed,” that is, of the “stroke,” as being that this discordance was apparently cleared away by devised conjunctions of works with faith.

In the first place something shall be said in passing about the conjunctions of good works with faith that are devised by those who have believed themselves to be keener and more sagacious than all others, and at the same time to be endowed with such gifts of genius as to be able by reasonings from fallacies to induce upon any falsity whatever an appearance of truth. But in order that this may be investigated, presented to the comprehension, and afterwards unfolded, I will here speak of those conjunctions of good works with faith, by means of which the disagreement with the Word is apparently cleared away, some of which are believed by the simple, and some devised by the learned. [2] (1) The very simple know no otherwise than that faith alone consists in believing those things that are in the Word, and that are taught therefrom by the doctrine of the church. (2) The less simple do not know what faith alone is; they merely know that faith is to believe what must be done; and few of them make any distinction between believing and doing. (3) Others, however, suppose that faith produces good works, but do not consider how it produces them. (4) Others think that faith must always precede, and that goods are brought forth from it, or spring from it as fruit does from a tree. (5) Some believe that this is done by man’s cooperation, others that it is done without his cooperation. (6) But as the doctrine declares that faith alone without good works is what saves, therefore some make no account of good works, saying in their heart that everything they do is good in God’s sight, and that evils are not seen by God. (7) But as deeds and works, and doing and working, are so frequently mentioned in the Word, from the necessity of reconciling the Word with that dogma, they devise various modes of conjunctions that are not consistent, and yet are such that faith is kept by itself, and works by themselves, to the end that salvation may be in faith, and nothing of it in works. (8) Some conjoin faith with the endeavor to do good with those who have attained to the last stage of justification, yet with an endeavor that derives nothing from the voluntary part of man, but only from influx or inspiration, since the good that is from the voluntary part of man is in itself not good.

(10) Some conjoin faith with moral good and with civil good, which are goods that are to be done for the sake of life in the world, not for the sake of eternal life; and they contend that these are the goods that are meant by the “deeds” and “works,” and “doing” and “working,” mentioned in the Word; and that for the sake of the uses there, good works must be taught and preached before the laity, because they have no knowledge of the arcana respecting the conjunction of faith and works, and some cannot comprehend them. (11) Many of the learned suppose that in faith alone all are conjoined, that is, that love to God, charity towards the neighbor, the good of life, works, the Lord’s merit, and God, are all included in faith alone, except that man thinks, wills, and does something from himself respecting these. (12) It is to be known that many other modes of conjunction have been devised, and that still more are devised by the same persons in the spiritual world; for spiritual thought can spread forth into innumerable things that natural thought cannot reach. I have seen a certain person in the spiritual world who had thought out hundreds of modes of conjunction, and in every one there was a progress in the train of thought from a beginning through means to an end; but when he had reached the end, and believed that he now saw the conjunction, he was enlightened and perceived that the more interiorly he thought upon the subject the more he separated faith from good works instead of conjoining them. From this it can be seen what the modes of conjunction are that have been devised especially by the learned, by which the disagreement of this dogma with the Word may appear like an agreement, which is what is meant by “the stroke of death of the beast was healed.” 787. And the whole earth wondered after the beast, signifies the acceptance of these by the more learned in the church, and the reception from afar by the less learned. This is evident from the signification of “to wonder after the beast,” as being (in reference to the disagreement with the Word apparently cleared away by devised conjunctions of works with faith) the acceptance by the more learned, and the reception by the less learned (of which presently).

[2] In the Word mention is frequently made of “going” and “walking after God,” “after other gods,” “after a leader,” and “after many”; and these expressions signify to follow and acknowledge in heart, also to be and to live with them, and to be consociated, as in the following passages. In the first book of Kings: David hath kept My commandments, and hath walked after Me with his whole heart, to do that which is right in Mine eyes (14:8). In the first book of Samuel: The sons of Jesse had gone after Saul to the war (17:13). In Moses: Thou shalt not follow after many to evils; thou shalt not answer respecting a cause of strife to turn aside after many (Exod. 23:2). In Jeremiah: Thou shalt not go after other gods whom thou hast not known (7:9). In the same: They went after other gods to serve them (Jer. 11:10; Deut. 8:19). In Moses: The man who shall go after Baal-peor, Jehovah thy God will destroy from the midst of thee (Deut. 4:3). From this it is evident that “to go after” anyone signifies to follow him, obey him, act from him, and live from him; “to walk and live”8 also signifies to live.

[3] Acceptance by the more learned and reception from afar by the less learned is signified, because the modes of conjoining faith with its life, which is good works, were devised by the learned; while the less learned, because they were unable to investigate interiorly these disagreements, received them, each one according to his apprehension; consequently this dogma, that faith alone is the essential means of salvation, has been received in the whole earth, or in the Christian Church. [4] It shall be explained also in a few words how the chief point of that religion, namely, that in faith alone there is salvation, and not in good works, has been apparently cleared away, and is therefore accepted by the learned. For these have devised stages of the progress of faith to good works, which they call steps of justification. They make the first step to be the hearing from masters and preachers, the second step information from the Word that it is so; the third step acknowledgment; and since nothing of the church can be acknowledged in heart unless temptation precede, therefore they join temptation to this step; and if the doubts that are then encountered are dissipated by the Word or by the preacher, and thus the man conquers, they say that the man has confidence, which is a certainty that it is so, and also confidence that he is saved by the Lord’s merit. But as the doubts that are encountered in temptation arise chiefly from not understanding the Word, where “deeds,” “works,” “doing,” and “working” are so often mentioned, they say that the understanding must be held in check under obedience to faith. Hence follows the fourth step, which is the endeavor to do good; and in this they rest, saying that when man arrives at this stage he has been justified, and that then all the acts of his life are accepted by God, and the evils of his life are not seen by God, because they are pardoned. This conjunction of faith with good works has been devised by the learned and also accepted by them. But this conjunction rarely extends to the common people, both because it transcends the comprehension of some of them, and because they are for the most part engaged in"

These know nothing about the steps of justification, but believe that faith alone is the only means of salvation; and when they see from the Word and hear from the preacher that goods must be done and that man will be judged according to his works, they think that faith produces good works, for they know no otherwise than that faith is to know the things that the preacher teaches, and thence to think that it is so; and because this comes first they believe that faith produces good works, which they call the fruits of faith, not knowing that such a faith is a faith of the memory only, and viewed in itself is historical faith, because it is from another, and thus another’s with themselves, and that such a faith can never bring forth any good fruit. Into this error most of those in the Christian world have fallen, for the reason that faith alone has been received as the chief means, yea, as the only means of salvation.

This is evident from the signification of “to worship,” as being to acknowledge and revere as Divine, and thus to receive in doctrine that is for the church; for such as acknowledge the Divine and from such acknowledgment revere it, these worship it, and also receive it in doctrine which is for the church. Also from the signification of “the dragon,” as being those who are in faith separated from charity in doctrine and in life, thus who acknowledge salvation and justification by faith alone (of which see above, n. 714). Also from the signification of “the authority of the beast” from the dragon, as being the establishment and corroboration of that dogma by devised conjunctions of faith with works (see above, n. 786). From this it is clear that “they worshipped the dragon which gave authority to the beast” signifies the acknowledgment of salvation and justification by faith alone, established and corroborated by devised modes of conjoining it with good works, and thus its reception in doctrine. It is said that the dogma of salvation and justification by faith alone is established and corroborated by devised modes of conjoining it with good works; but it must be understood that this doctrine can in no way be established and corroborated by such means, for this dogma is meant by “the dragon,” and the confirmation of it by reasonings from the natural man is represented by this “beast;” and “the dragon and its beast” signify what is discordant with the Word and cannot be conjoined with it. [2] To make clear that it cannot be conjoined, I will here show that faith alone can in no way produce any good, that is, that from faith alone no good fruit can come. It is supposed that faith is to believe that the Lord suffered the cross for our sins, and thereby redeemed us from hell, and that it is mainly a faith in this that justifies and saves. It is supposed, moreover, that faith is a believing that God is triune, a believing of what is taught in the Word, a believing in eternal life and in the resurrection on the day of the Last Judgment, and the other things that the church teaches. And as they separate faith from the life of charity, which is doing what is good, most persons at this day suppose that to know these things and to think and speak about them is the faith that saves; consequently they pay no attention to willing them and doing"

Nor does the church teach this, because the doctrine of the church is the doctrine of faith alone, and not the doctrine of life. The doctrine of life they call moral theology, which they make of little account, because they believe that the virtues of a moral life, which in themselves are good works, contribute nothing to salvation. [3] But that knowing, thinking, and speaking about these things is not faith, and even if this be called faith it does not bring forth what is good, as a tree its fruits, can be seen from the following. (1) All things that a man knows, thinks about, and talks about so far as he understands them, he calls truths; and all things that he wills and does so far as he loves them, he calls goods; thus truths belong to man’s faith, and goods9 to his love. From this it is clear that the truths, which pertain to faith, are distinct from the goods, which pertain to love, as knowing and thinking are distinct from willing and doing. That they are distinct, and how far they are distinct, man can know from this, that it is possible for a man to know, to think about, speak about, and even to understand, many things that he does not will and do because he does not love them; but on the other hand, whatever a man wills and does from love, that he thinks and speaks about from faith; if not before the world yet with himself when he is alone and left to himself. [4] From this it follows, (2) that a man’s love and will enter into all things of his faith and thought, but faith and thought cannot enter into his love and will. For that which a man loves he also loves to do, loves to know, loves to think about, loves to speak about, and loves to understand, and thus loves to have faith in. So if the will be taken in place of the love, that which a man wills he also wills to do, wills to know, wills to think about, wills to speak about, wills to understand, and thus wills to have faith in. Similar things may be said of the will as of the love, for the reason that the love is of the will, and the will is the receptacle of the love. From this it now follows that love produces faith as the will produces thought. And as faith, like thought, is produced, and love, like the will, produces, it follows that it is a perversion to say that faith produces love. From this it is now first evident that to believe that"

(3) [5] Similar things as have been said of faith and love are to be understood also of truth and good, for truth pertains to faith and faith to truth, since that which a man believes he calls truth; also good pertains to love and love to good, since that which a man loves be calls good. Truth regarded in itself is nothing but good in form; for while good may be made evident to the feeling it cannot be made evident to the sight except in some form; and the form in which it is made evident to the sight in the thought, and thus in the understanding and perception, is called truth. From this, too, it follows that love produces faith as good produces truth; consequently that faith does not produce the good of love as a tree does fruit. (4) [6] Again, knowing and thinking and speaking therefrom are from the memory; but willing and doing from love are from the life. Man can think and speak about many things from the memory that are not from his life, which is love; this every hypocrite and flatterer can do; but when he is left to himself he cannot think and speak anything from the life that is not from his love, for love is the life of everyone, and such as the love is, such is the life. But the memory is only a storehouse, from which the life selects what it may think and speak, and what serves the life that it may be nourished by it. To say, therefore, that faith produces goods as a tree does fruits is to say that a man’s thought and speech produce his life, and that his life does not produce his thought and speech; and yet the evil, even the very worst, can think and speak truths from the memory, while only the good can do so from the life. (5) [7] That faith alone, or faith separated from goods in act, which are good works, is not possible, is evident from this, that the essence of faith is charity, and charity is the affection of doing the things that belong to faith; consequently faith without charity is like thought without affection; and as thought without affection is no thought, so faith without charity is no faith. Therefore to speak of faith without charity is to speak of thought without affection, of life without a soul, of existere without esse, of form without that"

(6) [8] Because faith without charity is not possible; and yet the thought and persuasion that a thing is so appears as if it were faith, and is called faith; but it is not saving faith, it is historical faith, because it is from the mouth of another. For one who believes anything from another whom he thinks worthy of belief, and who receives this, stores it in his memory, and from the memory thinks and speaks about it without seeing whether it be false or true, has no other hold upon it than as something historical. But if he confirms this in himself by appearances from the Word and by reasonings, from historical faith it becomes to him persuasive faith, which faith is like the sight of an owl, which sees objects in darkness and nothing in the light. Such persuasive faith exists from every confirmation of what is false. For every falsity can be confirmed until it seems to be a truth; and a falsity so confirmed shines with a fatuous lumen. From this also it is clear that such a faith cannot produce what is good. (7) [9] As faith of thought is nothing but historical faith or persuasive faith, it follows that it is merely natural faith. For spiritual faith is produced from spiritual love, which is charity, just as light is produced from the sun; and it does not produce that love, as light does not produce the sun. Therefore merely natural faith is produced from merely natural love, which derives its soul from the love of self, and the delight of that love is a delight of the flesh, which is called pleasure, lust, or lewdness, from which evils of every kind gush forth, and from evils falsities. Thence it is clear that faith proceeding from these cannot produce goods as a tree does good fruits, and if it produces any goods they are goods from what is man’s own (proprium) which are in themselves evils, and at the same time are meritorious goods which are in themselves iniquitous. But it is otherwise with spiritual faith, which shall be treated of in the following article."

This is evident from the signification of “to worship,” as being to acknowledge as certain, and thus to adore as Divine (as above, n. 789); also from the signification of “the beast,” as being the reasonings from the natural man confirming the separation of faith from life (see above, n. 774). And as this beast was seen to have seven heads and ten horns, and moreover was like a leopard as to his body, a bear as to his feet, and a lion as to his mouth, by which various things are signified, so here also the same things are meant by “the beast,” since it was on account of these that they worshipped the beast. [2] As the preceding article treated of this, that faith alone, or faith separated from charity, cannot produce goods of life as a tree does fruits, it is important to now set forth how to acquire spiritual faith, which is faith from charity. But as the learned world has not heretofore known what is meant by the spiritual or what is the nature of the spiritual in its essence, and how it is distinguished from what is natural, so neither could it know what spiritual faith is, and how it is distinguished from natural faith. And yet natural faith apart from spiritual faith as its origin is no faith at all, but merely knowledge (scientia) and thought therefrom that a thing is so; and if this is called faith, it is historical faith, and when it is confirmed is a persuasive faith, and both of these kinds of faith are natural, and faith merely natural does not save, but spiritual faith; consequently it shall now be told in what follows how spiritual faith is formed by the Lord. 790b. It is known in the world that there is a natural man and a spiritual man, as also that the natural man is worldly and the spiritual man heavenly; but still it is not known what spiritual faith is, and how it differs from natural faith. [3] It is therefore to be known, (1) That every man has two minds, one natural and the other spiritual; and as it is the mind that wills and thinks, every man has also natural will and thought and spiritual will and thought.

From this it follows that as faith is in man, it, too, is natural or spiritual; and that natural faith is according to man’s will and thought in the world, and spiritual faith is according to his will and thought in heaven. It is said the will and thought, because all things from which man is a man have relation to these two, for from the will he acts, and from the thought he speaks. And as a man acts and speaks either from self or from God, so he wills and thinks either from self or from God. From this it is clear, in the first place, that there is natural faith and spiritual faith; and that natural faith apart from spiritual faith is to think such things as are in the Word from self, while natural faith from spiritual faith is to think such things as are in the Word from God; although this also seems to the man to be from himself. (2) [4] As every man has two minds, a natural and a spiritual, and the natural mind is opened and formed by such things as are in the world, while the spiritual mind is opened and formed by such things as are in heaven, and as the things that are in heaven are all spiritual, so a man’s spiritual mind must needs be opened and formed by such things as are in the Word, in which all things are spiritual because they are Divine. In the Word there are truths that are to be known and thought, and goods that must be willed and done; therefore it is by these goods and these truths that man’s spiritual mind is opened and formed. From this it follows, that unless the spiritual mind is opened and formed by truths and goods from the Word it remains closed; and when this is closed the natural mind only is opened and formed by such things as are in the world, from which man, indeed, derives a natural lumen, but such as has in it no wisdom from heaven. From this it is clear, in the second place, that faith is not faith so long as the natural mind only is opened, but that if the thought that a thing is so is called faith it is historical faith, which is nothing but knowledge from which the natural man thinks. (3) [5] That the spiritual mind may be opened and formed it must have a storehouse from which it may draw its supplies; since unless man has such a storehouse he is empty, and in emptiness there can be no Divine operation. This storehouse is in the natural man and it is its memory, in which everything knowable can be"

In this storehouse for the formation of the spiritual man there must be truths that are to be believed and goods that are to be done, both of them from the Word and from doctrine and preaching from the Word. These man must learn even from infancy. But all these things, however abundant they may be, although they are from the Word, are natural until the spiritual mind is opened; for they are mere knowledge. Thought from this storehouse is what is called faith by those who separate faith from good works in doctrine and in life. (4) [6] The spiritual mind is primarily opened by man’s abstaining from doing evils because they are contrary to the Divine commandments in the Word. If man abstains from evils from any other fear than this the spiritual mind is not opened. The following are the reasons why this is what opens the spiritual mind: First, that the evils with man must be removed before communication and conjunction with heaven can be granted him; since evils, which are all in the natural man, keep heaven closed, and yet heaven must be opened, for otherwise man remains natural. The second reason is that the Word is from the Lord, and consequently the Lord is in the Word, even so that He is the Word; for the Word is Divine truth all of which is from the Lord. From this it follows that he who abstains from doing evils because they are contrary to the Divine commandments in the Word abstains from them from the Lord. The third reason is, that as far as evils are removed so far goods enter. That this is so can be seen by man from natural lumen alone, for when lasciviousness is removed chastity enters; when intemperance is removed temperance enters; when deceit is removed sincerity enters; when hatred and the delight of revenge are removed love and the delight of love and friendship enter; and so in other cases; and this for the reason that the Lord enters, and heaven with Him, so far as man from the Word abstains from doing evils, since he then abstains from them from the Lord. (5) [7] But this shall be illustrated by examples. Take for illustration the four commandments of the Decalog, “thou shalt not commit adultery,” “thou shalt not steal,” “thou shalt not kill,” “thou shalt not bear false witness.” These commandments are Divine, since they are in the Word.

When anyone shuns and averts himself from theft because of a like fear as from adultery, he loves sincerity, and loves the good of the neighbor as his own good. When anyone shuns and averts himself from murders or from deadly hatred from a like fear he loves the neighbor and is in charity. When anyone shuns and averts himself from false testimony because of a like fear he loves justice and loves truthfulness, and this from the Lord, because from the Word; consequently when after death he becomes a spirit he is like an angel of heaven, and therefore becomes an angel of heaven. But when one does not shun adultery from such a holy fear, but from a fear for his reputation, and thus of the loss of honor and gain, or from a fear of the law, or of disease, or because of weakness, he is still unchaste, since he merely fears the world and the loss of his prosperity in the world, and does not fear the Lord, and thus does not fear the loss of heaven and of eternal life. In like manner when anyone abstains from thefts, from murders or deadly hatreds, and from false testimonies, from natural fear only and not from spiritual fear, he abstains from these from self and not from the Lord; and he who does this from self still remains in them; and no one can be withdrawn from these except by the Lord. From this it can be seen that the spiritual mind with man is opened by this, that from the Word he abstains from doing evils; and that it is opened in the same degree in which he abstains from them by shunning and turning away from them. (6) [8] So much respecting the opening of the spiritual mind. Something shall now be said about its formation. The spiritual mind is formed from those things that are in man’s memory from the Word; for the memory is the storehouse spoken of above, but these things are elevated therefrom in this manner: First, there is given to man the affection of truth, which is called the spiritual affection of truth, which is that man loves truth because it is truth. This affection of truth is then given because when evils are removed man is in goods from the Lord, and good loves truth and truth good, and the two will to be conjoined. This affection is given by"

Secondly, those things that are from the Word in man’s storehouse mentioned above, are drawn forth and purified by the Lord, and genuine truths are there discriminated and separated from falsities; for man’s spiritual mind can be formed only out of genuine truths, since heaven is in no other. Thirdly, those truths are elevated by the Lord in a wonderful manner, and become spiritual; this is effected by the influx of heaven, and thus of spiritual things corresponding to natural; and these truths are there disposed into a heavenly form (what this is may be seen in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 200–212). Fourthly, the truths that are elevated into the spiritual mind are not in a natural but in a spiritual form. Truths in a spiritual form are such as are in the spiritual sense of the Word, but truths in a natural form are such as are in the natural sense of the Word; that these are distinct, and yet make one by correspondences, has been made clear in the work on Heaven and Hell (n. 87–115). For this reason, when man after death becomes a spirit and his spiritual mind is opened, he no longer thinks and speaks naturally, but spiritually. Fifthly, so long as man is living in the world he is wholly ignorant of what he thinks in the spiritual mind; he knows only what he thinks from that mind in the natural; but after death the state is changed, and he then thinks from the spiritual mind, and not from the natural. Thus much respecting the opening of the spiritual mind and its formation. (7) [9] When a man’s spiritual mind has been opened and formed then the Lord forms the natural mind; for man’s natural mind is formed by the Lord by means of the spiritual mind; and for the reason that man’s spiritual mind is in heaven, and his natural mind is in the world; for it is only from heaven, and when communication and conjunction with heaven have been effected, that the natural can be formed to the idea of such things as are in heaven. This formation is effected by the Lord by an influx out of the spiritual mind into the natural, by means of which the things that are in the natural mind are so arranged as to correspond to those that are in the spiritual mind. (This correspondence is treated of in many places in the Arcana Coelestia, and also in the work on Heaven and Hell. ) These things that are in the natural mind out of"

All those things that are in the natural mind out of the spiritual mind come under man’s intuition and into his perception. (8) [10] It is to be known that this formation of the two minds with man goes on from his infancy to his old age, and afterwards to eternity; and sometimes from the middle age of man to his last age, and afterwards to eternity; but still in another way after the life in the world than during the life in the world. And as man is formed, so is he perfected in intelligence and wisdom, and becomes a man. For no man is a man from his natural mind; from that he is rather a beast; but he becomes a man through intelligence and wisdom from the Lord, and so far as he is intelligent and wise he is a beautiful man and an angel of heaven. But so far as he rejects, suffocates, and perverts the truths and goods of the Word, thus of heaven and the church, and therefore rejects intelligence and wisdom, so far he is a monster and not a man, because he is so far a devil. From this it can be seen that man is not a man from his parents, but from the Lord, of whom he is born and created anew. This, therefore, is regeneration and a new creation. (9) [11] This being premised, something shall now be said about the will and understanding of the man who has been created anew or regenerated by the Lord; and afterwards about charity and faith. His will in the natural man is formed by the influx of the heat of heaven through his spiritual mind from the Lord. The heat of heaven in its essence is the Divine good proceeding from the Lord’s Divine love. But the understanding in the natural man is formed by the influx of the light of heaven through his spiritual man from the Lord. The light of heaven in its essence is the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord’s Divine love. From this it follows that the will is formed out of goods, and from these man has love and affection; and that the understanding is formed out of truths therefrom, and from these man has intelligence and wisdom.

The only difference is that the understanding sees and the will feels. From this it is clear that such as man’s will of good is, such is his understanding of truth, or what is the same, such as man’s love is such is his intelligence. From this it is evident that although the will and the understanding are two faculties of life, still they act as one, and for this reason these two faculties of life are called one mind. This relates to the natural man. In the spiritual man also there are a will and an understanding, but much more perfect; and these are also called one mind. This therefore is the spiritual mind, and the other is the natural mind. But these are such with the man whose spiritual mind has been opened and formed; but it is altogether different with the man whose spiritual mind is closed, and only the natural mind opened. (10) [12] The same can be said of charity and faith as has been said of the will and understanding; for the will is the subject and receptacle of charity as it is the subject and receptacle of good, and the understanding is the subject and receptacle of faith because it is the subject and receptacle of truth; for charity derives all that it is from good, and faith derives all that it is from truth; and this is why it is said the good of charity, and the truth of faith. From this it follows that charity and faith act as one, like will and understanding; and that such as the charity is such is the faith. But these are in the natural mind; but in the spiritual mind there is the love of good in place of charity, and the perception of truth in place of faith. (11) [13] That spiritual love, which is charity, produces faith, can be seen merely from this, that man after death, who is then called a spirit, is nothing but an affection which is of love, and his thought is from that; consequently the whole angelic heaven is arranged into societies according to the varieties of affections; and everyone in heaven, in whatever society he may be, thinks from his affection; and therefore it is affection, which is love, that produces faith, and such faith as the affection is; for faith is nothing but thinking that a thing is so in truth, while affection means love in its continuation.

It was otherwise of old with the ancients where the churches were. Because these knew that love produces all things of thought, therefore charity (which is the affection of knowing truths, of understanding them, and of willing them, and thus of becoming wise) was made by them the chief means of salvation. And as that affection makes one with faith they did not know what faith is. [14] From this it is evident not only how faith is formed with man but also that faith never can produce charity; but charity, which is spiritual love, forms faith as an effigy of itself, and in it presents an image of itself; and for this reason the nature of faith is known from charity and its goods, which are good works, as the nature of a tree is known from its fruit. By a “tree,” however, faith is not meant, but man in respect to his life; while its leaves signify the truths through which there is faith, and its fruits signify goods of life, which are the goods of charity. Besides these arcana respecting the formation of faith by the Lord by means of charity there are innumerable others; but still it is the Lord who works all these arcana, while man knows nothing about it; all that man needs to do is to learn truths from the Word and to live according to them. 791.

Verse 5. And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies, signifies the doctrine destroying utterly the goods of the Word and its truths. This is evident from the signification of “mouth,” as being doctrine, from which is instruction, preaching, and reasoning (of which above, n. 782). “The mouth of the beast,” signifies doctrine, because in the preceding verse it was said that “they worshipped the dragon and its beast;” and this signified the acknowledgment of that dogma, and the reception of it in doctrine; also because it was said above that “the mouth of that beast was as the mouth of a lion,” which signified instruction, preaching, and reasoning, which are from the received doctrine. The above is evident also from the signification of “speaking great things,” as being to teach evils that destroy the goods of the Word, for “great” is predicated in the Word of good, and in the contrary sense of evil, while “many” is predicated of truth, and in the contrary sense of falsity (see above, n. 336a, 337, 424). Because “the beast” means those who by reasonings separate faith from life, and those who do this destroy the goods of the Word, and because his “mouth” signifies their doctrine, therefore “to speak great things” signifies to destroy the goods of the Word. The above is evident also from the signification of “speaking blasphemies,” as meaning to falsify the truths of the Word (see above, n. 778). From this it is clear that “there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies” signifies the doctrine destroying the goods of the Word and utterly falsifying its truths. It is said utterly falsifying its truths, because the falsification of the Word even to the destruction of Divine truth, such as it is in the heavens and such as it is in the spiritual sense of the Word, is signified by “blasphemy” (see above, n. 778); this therefore is what is meant by utterly falsifying truths."

They are destroyed especially by teaching that faith without good works justifies and saves, and this is confirmed by the reasoning that no one can do good of himself, and that the good that a man does of himself must needs be meritorious good; and this is established by the Word, especially by the Pharisee and the publican praying in the temple: That the latter was justified merely by his saying, God be merciful to me a sinner; and that the Pharisee was not justified who said that he was not an extortioner, unjust, and an adulterer, as others were, and that he fasted twice in the week, and gave tithes of all that he possessed (Luke 18:10–14); and also by these words of the Lord: Doth the lord thank the servant for doing those things that were commanded him? I trow not. So ye also, when ye shall have done all things that are commanded you, say, We are surely useless servants, for we have done that which we ought to do (Luke 17:9, 10). But those are greatly mistaken who conclude from these words that there is nothing of justification and salvation in good works, but in faith alone, for they do not know what good works are. There are works that are done by man, and these are not good; and there are works that are done by the Lord through man, and these are good. Yet both of these appear alike in external form; but in internal form they are wholly unlike. The works enumerated by the Pharisee were works done from himself, and were therefore meritorious; so, too, the works done by command by servants, who are nevertheless called “useless.” [3] It shall now be told, therefore, how works are done by man himself, and how they are done by the Lord with man, also how the latter are distinguished from the former. It has been shown above (n. 790b) that man has two minds, one spiritual, the other natural. The spiritual mind is what is called the internal and the spiritual man, and the natural mind is what is called the external and the natural man. And as man has an internal spiritual and an"

This is meant by the Lord’s words in Luke: Now do ye Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter, but your inward part is full of extortion and wickedness. Ye foolish ones, did not He that made the outside make the inside also? But rather give for alms those things that are within, then behold all things are clean unto you (11:39–41). It is said, “the outside of the cup and of the platter,” and “the inside” of them, because the “cup” has a similar meaning as “wine,” and the “platter” a similar meaning as “food;” and “wine” signifies truth, and “food” signifies good. It is said also “give alms,” and this signifies love and charity. From this it is evident that whatever a man does from the external alone is unclean, but whatever he does from a cleansed internal through the external is clean, for this is from the Lord; but the other from man. But examples will illustrate this point also. The internal is doing good for the sake of good, speaking truth for the sake of truth, acting sincerely for the sake of sincerity, and doing what is just for the sake of justice. He who does good for the sake of good does good from good, thus from the Lord, who is Good itself, and from whom is all good; and he who speaks truth for the sake of truth speaks truth from truth, thus from the Lord, who is Truth itself and from whom is all truth. The like is true of him who acts sincerely for the sake of sincerity, and does what is just for the sake of justice; for sincerity is moral good and truth, and justice is civil good and truth; and all good and truth are from the Lord and not from man, because they are done from the internal through the external. But when a man does and speaks what is good, true, sincere, and just, for the sake of self and the world he does and speaks them from self, because from the external man without the internal; and such deeds or works are all evil, and if heaven is regarded in them they are meritorious, and all such are iniquitous. In this world no one can determine whether works are from the Lord or from man, since in external form the two kinds appear alike, but they can be distinguished by the Lord"

But how an internal is given to man, and an external from the internal, may be seen above (n. 790b). [4] From this it can be seen that if man were to fulfill all things of the law from self, that is, were to give much to the poor, were to do good to widows and orphans, to assist the needy, yea, were to give food to the hungry, and drink to the thirsty, to take in strangers, clothe the naked, and visit the sick and those who are bound in prison, preach and teach the gospel, convert the Gentiles, frequent temples, devoutly listen to preaching, attend the sacrament of the Supper frequently each year, spend time in praying, and other like things, and if his internal had not been purified from the love of rule and from the pride of self-intelligence, from the contempt of others, from hatred and revenge, from craftiness and malice, from insincerity and injustice, from the lasciviousness of adultery, and from other evils and falsities therefrom, still all these works would be hypocritical and from the man himself, and not from the Lord. But these same works when the internal has been purified are all good, because they are from the Lord with man. This has been testified to me from very many examples in the spiritual world. I have there heard that it has been granted to many to call to mind the acts of their life in the world, and to enumerate the good deeds they had done; but when their internal was opened it was found to be full of all evil and falsity therefrom; and it was then revealed to them that the good deeds they had enumerated they had done from self, because for the sake of self and the world. But it is otherwise with those who from the Word have abstained from doing evils, and have afterwards shunned and turned away from them because they are sins, and are contrary to love to God and to charity towards the neighbor. Their works were all good, although they had a similar appearance in external form as the works of those described above, and there was a perception in like manner of their having been done as if from self. These works are what are meant in the Word by the “works” that make a man spiritual, and make him happy to eternity; and these can in no way be separated from faith, for if faith were to be separated from these it would be dead, and a dead faith is a faith in falsity from evil."

It has been shown that charity produces faith as good produces truth, and as affection produces thought, likewise as fire produces light; therefore it is speaking wholly contrary to order and inversely, to say that faith produces charity or its goods, which are called good works. But it is to be known that charity (which in its essence is the affection of knowing, understanding, willing, and doing truth), does not come into any perception of man until it has formed itself in the thought, which is from the understanding; for it then presents itself under some form or image by which it appears before the interior sight, for the thought that a thing is so in truth is called faith. From this it is clear that charity is actually prior and faith posterior, as good is actually prior and truth posterior, or as that which produces is essentially prior to the product, and as the esse is prior to the existere, for charity is from the Lord, and is also formed first in the spiritual mind; but because charity does not appear to man before it becomes faith therefore it may be said that faith does not exist with man until it becomes charity in form. So it may be said of the existence of charity and faith with man, that they both come into existence at the same moment; for although charity produces faith, yet as they make one neither of them in respect to man’s perception can exist separate from the other in regard either to degree or to quality. Thence it is evident that the conjunction of the Lord with man is like the conjunction of good with truth. Good is from the Lord, and truths are with man, but they are truths that are not yet living. But as man receives good in truths so he receives the Lord into himself and lives; and he receives in the measure in which he abstains from evils, and from the Word shuns and turns away from them, for thus he shuns and turns away from them from the Lord and not from self. 796.

[2] This and the following verse treat of the destruction of the church, which is altogether destroyed as its truths are turned into falsities and its goods into evils. That the doctrine of faith separated from the life does this can be seen from the fact that the doctrine of faith is the doctrine of the church, and the doctrine of life, which is called moral theology, is an outside doctrine, that is, serviceable to the church at its pleasure, but is regarded as having nothing of salvation in it because it has nothing of faith in it; yet faith when separated from life is not alive, and what is not alive, but is dead, can save no one. [3] It is supposed that man from the doctrine of faith separate is able to believe that there is a God, that there is a heaven and a hell, that there is a life after death, that the Word is Divine, and therefore that what the Word contains is to be believed. These things man can indeed know and can think, and can even in some degree understand from the light of reason, and yet he cannot have such a faith in them as will remain long after death; for the faith that is of the life remains, but not faith separated from the life; and everyone has life to the extent that he abstains from evils, and shuns and turns away from them because they are contrary to the Word, thus contrary to the Lord. Faith from such a life awaits a man after death, because it is from the Lord, and thus is the Lord’s with man. Thence it is clear that from faith alone man cannot even believe that there is a God; how then can he believe the rest? From this it follows that the doctrine of faith separated destroys the church in respect to all its goods and truths. That this is so has been made abundantly evident to me from the state of such persons after death with whom I have talked.

Verse 6. And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, signifies the falsification of Divine truth, thus of the Word, which is from the Lord and which is the Lord. This is evident from the signification of “opening his mouth,” when the “mouth” signifies doctrine, and instruction, preaching, and reasoning therefrom (see above, n. 794), as being to instruct, preach, and reason; also from the signification of “blasphemy,” as being the falsification of the Word, even to the destruction of Divine truth such as it is in heaven (see above, n. 778); also from the signification of “God,” as being Divine truth, thus the Word. And as Divine truth is from the Lord, and is the Lord in heaven, therefore “blasphemy against God” signifies the falsification of Divine truth, or the Word, which is from the Lord, and which is the Lord. Moreover, the Word is the Lord because it is from the Lord, for the reason that the Word is the Divine truth, and the Divine truth proceeds from the Lord as a sun, and what proceeds belongs to Him from whom it proceeds, yea, is Himself; consequently the Divine truth, which is the source of all the wisdom and intelligence that angels and men have, is the Lord in heaven. Furthermore, the Word is such as it is with us in the world because that Word is the Divine truth in the ultimate of order, and contains a spiritual sense, which is the Divine truth such as it is in heaven. But more about this elsewhere. From this it is clear that “the beast opened his mouth in blasphemy against God” signifies the falsification of the Divine truth or the Word which is from the Lord and which is the Lord. [2] As this verse treats of blaspheming, and as “blasphemy” signifies the falsification of the divine truth or the Word, namely, by those who separate faith from life, in explaining this verse, I will state who of that class so falsify the Word as to wholly close heaven to themselves, and what the quality of such is; and then who of that class do not so falsify the Word as to close heaven to themselves,"

In this article those who so falsify the Word that they altogether close heaven to themselves shall be described, but in the following article the others in order. All those altogether close heaven to themselves who confirm themselves by doctrine and at the same time by life that faith alone without good works justifies and saves; the reason is that these so falsify the Word that it is contrary to the Divine truth which is in heaven, and from which is heaven. The Word may be falsified to this extent or it may not. [3] The reasons that they falsify the Word to that extent are these: (1) From their doctrine they regard the goods of life, which are good works, as of no value, and in their life they make them of no account, and yet the universal heaven is in good, for good is of love, and love is of the life. All the wisdom and all the happiness that angels of heaven have is from good through truths; and each one there has so much and such wisdom and happiness, as he has of the good from which are truths; consequently good is the very essence of angelic life, and thus the essence of heaven itself. Those, therefore, who ascribe the whole of salvation to faith alone, and nothing of it to good works, must needs close heaven to themselves; for they regard good, in which heaven consists, as of no account, and they make it of no account; and where good is not, there evil is; and where evil is, there is hell. (2) [4] Because these place everything of salvation, and thus everything of heaven and of the church, in faith alone, and nothing of these in the goods of charity, which are good works, they give little value to love to God and love towards the neighbor, and make these of no account; and yet the Lord teaches: That on these two commandments hang the Law and the Prophets (Matt. 22:34, 38). “The Law and the Prophets” are all things of the Word. Also the Lord says to the lawyer respecting these two commandments: Do these and thou shalt live (Luke 10:28)."

Therefore also the Lord teaches: He that hath My commandments and doeth them, he it is that loveth Me; but he that loveth Me not keepeth not My commandments (John 14:21, 24). From this it follows that those who regard good works, which are the goods of love, the goods of charity, and the goods of life, which in heaven are called uses, as of no account, and who make them of no account, close heaven to themselves; for they neither love God nor love the neighbor, and yet heaven is heaven from these two loves. This is especially what falsifies the Word even to the destruction of Divine truth, which in heaven is from the Lord, and which is the Lord there. (3) [5] Those who confirm themselves in doctrine and in life in the belief that faith alone without good works justifies and saves, close heaven to themselves by this also, that they excuse evil works; they excuse these by saying and believing that evils are not seen by God; or that with those who have faith the evils are forgiven (according to some with those who have the confidence of faith, according to others with those who are justified by faith). Therefore many think insanely, “Of what consequence is it for me to do goods when goods do not save me? Or what does it matter if I do evils, when evils do not damn me? I am in grace because I have faith.” Thus they live for themselves and for the world, and do not abstain from evil because it is evil, nor do good because it is good; if they abstain from evil it is from fear of the civil law and of the loss of reputation, and not from any fear of the Divine law and of the loss of eternal life; and if they do good it is from love of reward, and not from love of God.

If he lives as a citizen of the world he believes that he lives a good life; when yet such a life, if he does not live it as a citizen of heaven, is an evil life. Neither does he distinguish the one from the other, because the two appear alike in externals. He does not distinguish them, because good works, which make the life, he values lightly. From this it now follows that those who confirm themselves both in doctrine and in life in the belief that faith alone without good works justifies and saves, altogether close heaven to themselves. (4) [6] Again, they close heaven to themselves by this, that although their life is a merely natural life, everything of which is drawn from the love of self and of the world, yet they attribute to themselves the Lord’s merit, saying in their hearts, “If only I shall have believed with trust and confidence that the Lord endured the cross for me, and thereby redeemed me, I can have eternal life, and this because that righteousness and that merit are imputed to me by faith, and nothing of it by works of the life.” And yet there is no imputation of the Lord’s merit; so neither can life thence be imputed to man. But a life from the Lord is given, such as has been described above in the article treating of it. Therefore to impute to oneself the merit of the Lord, and not to live according to His commandments in the Word, and thus live from Him, is blasphemy; because this implies the possibility of living solely for self and the world, thus wickedly, in the Lord.

For such believe that knowing and thinking opens heaven, and not at the same time willing and doing, when yet these are primary, and the others are secondary. For the life of man’s thought is from the affection of his will.

The faith that is then suffered to be given through these beseechings is a faith in falsity from evil, for where good is not, there evil is; and where evil is, there falsity is; and faith in falsity from evil is the faith of hell, which is called dead faith; and this closes heaven. (7) [9] Heaven is especially closed to them by the application of the Word to confirm all these things; for they thus falsify them even to the destruction of the Divine truth that is in heaven. For our Word in its spiritual sense is the Divine truth such as it is in heaven; and if the sense of the letter is falsified so as to destroy the spiritual sense, heaven is closed up; for the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord makes heaven, yea, is heaven; since the angels there are angels from the reception of it. (8) [10] It has been said that those altogether close heaven to themselves who, both in doctrine and in life, make good works to be of no account from the principle that faith without good works justifies and saves. It shall now be stated briefly how heaven is closed by doctrine and how by life. Doctrine closes by consent, affirmation, confirmation, and persuasion that it is so; for then man not only thinks that it is so, but also wills it to be so. And if he still does goods because they are commanded in the Word he does only moral goods from the natural man; and these goods are from himself, and are meritorious goods. For all of man’s doing is from his will and is according to his will, since a deed is nothing but the will in its activity; consequently when a man thinks and also wills that there is nothing of salvation in works, he can do no other goods than such as are like their origin. Of this character are many of the learned, who have confirmed faith alone with themselves by their preaching and writings. In the spiritual world the mind of such appears to be covered as with a veil, or to be involved as if in a dense cloud, which prevents the entrance of light or truth from heaven; thus heaven is closed in them. But a life according to that doctrine altogether closes heaven because their faith is that the goods of life do not save, nor do the evils of life condemn."

But how the spiritual mind is opened, and thus communication and conjunction with heaven is granted to man, has been explained above (n. 790b). 798a. To blaspheme His name, signifies by falsifying all the quality of Divine truth or the Word. This is evident from the signification of “blaspheming,” as being to falsify the Divine truth, thus the Word, which is from the Lord and which is the Lord (see just above, n. 797); also from the signification of “name,” as being the quality of a thing or state (see above, n. 148, 676), here all the quality of Divine truth or the Word; because it is said “His name,” that is, “the name of God.” “The name of the Lord” means in the Word every good of love and every truth from that good from which He is worshipped (see above, n. 102, 135, 696). From this it is clear that “to blaspheme the name of God” signifies to falsify all the quality of the Divine truth or the Word, also every good and truth by which the Lord is worshipped. That those who separate faith from good works both in doctrine and life falsify all the quality of the Divine truth, or all things of the Word, has been explained in the preceding article. This can be concluded from what has been frequently said above, namely, that such shut out love and charity, from which works become good and from which faith derives its essence, that these may not, together with faith, be means of salvation; thus they not only falsify those passages of the Word that teach about love to God and love toward the neighbor, but also those passages where “works,” “deeds,” “working,” and “doing,” are mentioned; and when these are falsified all things of the Word are also falsified; for the remaining things of the Word, which are called its truths, live from these; and when life is withdrawn the other things are dead.

[2] Since in the Christian churches in which faith alone is received as the head of their doctrinals there are those who are learned and those who are simple, also those who separate faith from the goods of life and those who conjoin faith with these, thus those who falsify the Word much and those who falsify it little, and since the preceding article treated of those who so falsify the Word as altogether to close heaven to themselves, so now those shall be treated of who do not so falsify the Word as to close heaven to themselves. These are such as confirm with themselves that the faith that justifies and saves pro duces goods of life as a tree does fruits. With those who confirm that doctrine in the life heaven is not closed, but its lowest part, where there is an entrance, is open. The reasons are as follows: [3] First, although they invert the Divine order, which is that charity produces faith, and not that faith produces charity, yet with those who confirm that conjunction in doctrine and in life that inverted order can afterwards be reversed; and when it has been reversed they enter heaven in its lowest parts. They do not enter interiorly because their faith, by which they believed themselves to have been justified and saved, is derived more from falsities than from truths; and in the lowest parts of heaven are they who are in falsities from doctrine and religion and yet are in the good of life. Their falsities are appearances of truth from the sense of the letter of the Word, all of which have life as their end. It is almost similar with everyone who is being reformed; he first forms doctrine for himself out of the Word, and distinguishes in it between the things that are to be believed and the things that are to be done. The things that are to be believed he calls faith, and the things that are to be done he calls charity, but as the order with everyone has been reversed from birth he looks to faith in the first place and charity in the second. Yet if he lives the life of faith, which is charity, the order is by degrees turned about and restored; and from charity he lives faith. Then so far as his faith is from genuine truths he enters heaven; for, as has been said above, the Divine truth proceeding"

From this it can be seen how at the present day faith has become the first and chief thing of the church, namely, because they have followed the order reversed from birth, and because they have been satisfied with the life of the world, and have been led by the pride of self-intelligence; and for this reason they have stopped at the first stage of reformation. [4] The second reason that such do not close heaven to themselves is, that good works are love and charity in act, and it is from these that heaven is heaven; for all angels and all spirits are affections and thoughts therefrom; or what is the same, are loves and intelligences therefrom; and there are two loves that are the universal and fundamental loves of all, namely, love to the Lord and love towards the neighbor, which is called charity. In these loves are all who do goods from the Word; for all good is of love. Now since those who confirm with themselves in doctrine and life the belief that faith produces good works as a tree does fruits look from faith to good, therefore they have conjunction with heaven, not however with the spiritual heaven, but with the natural heaven, which is in things ultimate and may be called the entrance. Such cannot be admitted more interiorly for the reason that until faith becomes charity in form it is natural, and the natural can produce only what is natural. It is otherwise when faith becomes faith from charity; then faith becomes spiritual because charity, from which is faith, is spiritual. With these the spiritual mind is opened, but with the former only the natural mind is opened; yet this is opened more deeply and interiorly according to the quality of the faith and the quality of the life therefrom. The mind of these, viewed in the light of heaven, appears snowy, such as rational light is; and the rational is intermediate between the spiritual mind and the natural mind. [5] Thirdly, if the state of the mind and life of those who believe that faith produces good works, and who also do them, is explored more interiorly, it will be seen that they are interiorly natural; since their faith is simply a knowledge of the commandments of the Word; and when the interior natural sight, which is called the rational, enters into this faith, an acknowledgment is produced that"

But the love that operates into this acknowledgment can be no other than a love of reward for the goods done, and to them this reward is eternal life. And as love of reward is not from God but from man, for in reward man regards his own good and not the good of the neighbor, it follows that this love is natural; consequently that the state of mind and life of those who believe that faith produces good works, and who do them according to their faith, is natural. But if they do not do good works from obedience, the love that leads them is the love of the glory that comes from erudition, or the love of the reputation that comes from being raised to honors, or from gaining riches. Such, however, merely say that they acknowledge and believe; in heart they do not acknowledge or believe; therefore they are the lowest natural, and heaven is altogether closed to them. [6] In order that it may be known that to do good from obedience is from the natural man it shall be told briefly what it is to do good from charity. No one can do good from charity unless his spiritual mind is opened, and the spiritual mind is opened only by man’s abstaining from doing evils and shunning them, and finally turning away from them because they are contrary to the Divine commandments in the Word, thus contrary to the Lord. When man so shuns and turns away from evils all things that he thinks, wills, and does, are good because they are from the Lord; for the Lord is continually present, knocks at the door, is urgent and wishes to enter, but evils oppose; therefore man must open the door by removing the evils, for it is only when evils are removed that the Lord enters and sups there (Rev. 3:20). It is said that man opens and removes, because it is from self that man does evils; and inasmuch as the Lord is continually present, knocks at the door, and is urgent, as has been said, man has the ability to refrain from evils as if of himself; this ability is also given to every man. This is why, since man can of himself close heaven to himself he can also as if of himself open heaven, provided he thinks and wills to refrain from evils, looks to the Lord, and when he refrains acknowledges that it is from the Lord. When, therefore, evils have been removed, whatever man does is good, since it is from the Lord; and whatever man does from the Lord is not natural-moral, but is spiritual-"

Such is the natural in which those are who are in the entrance to heaven; and to this those come who do good only from obedience, who are such as confirm in themselves, in doctrine and life, that faith produces good works as a tree does fruits. [7] Fourthly, moreover it is to be known that those who believe that faith produces good works as a tree does fruits believe also that heaven is allotted them before evils are removed; and yet so long as evils are with man whatever goods he does are not good, for from an evil tree no other than evil fruits spring forth; therefore the only way to heaven is for man from the Word to abstain from evils because they are sins, which unless they be first removed, the Lord cannot enter and bestow heaven. [8] The fifth reason why those do not close heaven to themselves who confirm themselves in doctrine and life in the belief that faith produces good works as a tree does fruits, is, that they do not falsify the Word as those do who believe in justification and salvation by faith without good works. Those who believe in a faith without good works falsify all things of the Word that mention and enjoin love, charity, goods, works, deeds, working, and doing; and this they do even to the destruction of the Divine truth in the heavens, by understanding them as meaning either faith, or the moral and civil goods of the world, or as having been said merely for the common people on account of the simplicity of their faith. Thus they destroy the Divine truth itself by arguments from man’s inability to fulfill the law, by the nature of the good that is from man as not being good, and by the removal of the merit that inheres in goods from man. But those who in simplicity join good works to faith do not falsify all those things of the Word, and thence do not remove faith from the love to God, and thereby remove the Divine operation in all the particulars to be done by man, as also in all the particulars to be believed by man; for they think and say that good works are to be done as if by man, for he who does not act and believe as if of himself believes nothing and"

And yet, since they have no genuine truths, while they do not close heaven to themselves they can advance no farther than to the threshold of heaven. To such of them, however, as have loved truths for the sake of truths heaven is opened when the Divine order has been restored with them, and that is done when charity and its good are in the first place, and faith and its truths in the second, for they are then like those who go on in a straight way with the face looking forward, while before they were like those who go with the face looking backward. [9] Sixthly, there are also many who make charity the essential means of salvation, as others do faith, and yet do not live the life of charity; but since their charity is merely a confession of the mouth that this is the truth, it is their faith alone; therefore their charity likewise is not living but dead, and in consequence they differ very little from the confessors of faith alone, having a like heart but an unlike soul, but yet the one like the other closes heaven to himself. 799a. And His tabernacle, signifies all the doctrine of the church and the worship therefrom. This is evident from the signification of “tabernacle,” as being the church in respect to doctrine and worship, thus, too, the doctrine and worship of the church; therefore to falsify these is signified by “blaspheming the tabernacle of God.” “A tabernacle” signifies the church in respect to doctrine and worship, because those who were of the church in most ancient times dwelt in tabernacles and tents, and also journeyed with them, for they were then mostly shepherds of sheep; and the father of the family taught those who were born of his house the precepts of charity and thus the life of love, in tabernacles, as was done afterwards in temples; and this is why a “tabernacle” has a similar signification as “the house of God,” namely, the worship of God according to doctrine, consequently also the church, since the church is a church from a life according to doctrine, and a life according to doctrine is worship. [2] Since these most ancient people with whom was the church worshipped God under a human form, and since God under a human form is the Lord, they worshipped the Lord; and therefore their church was the celestial church, which is distinguished from"

And as the church with the most ancient people was such, and the doctrine of love to the Lord was then taught in tabernacles, and thence tabernacles were more loved by the Lord than temples, therefore by command of the Lord on Mount Sinai a tabernacle was built in which the Israelitish nation might have holy worship; and afterwards, in commemoration of the most holy worship in tabernacles, the feast of tabernacles was instituted. From this it is clear why a “tabernacle” signifies the doctrine of the church, and worship therefrom. 799b. [3] This signification of “tabernacle” is evident from the following passages. In Moses: How good are thy tabernacles O Jacob, thy tents O Israel (Num. 24:5). Here and elsewhere in the Word both tabernacles and tents are mentioned; and a “tabernacle” signifies the church consisting of those who are in the good of love to the Lord; and the “tent” signifies the church consisting of those who are in truths from that good; and as doctrine and worship therefrom constitute the church, a “tabernacle” signifies the doctrine of the good of love, and a “tent” the doctrine of truth from that good. So, too, “tabernacles,” in the plural, signify the goods of the church and of doctrine, and “tents” the truths of the church and of doctrine. This makes clear the signification of those words of Balaam,10 “How good are thy tabernacles O Jacob, thy tents O Israel,” “Jacob” signifying the church that is in the good of doctrine and of life, and “Israel” the church that is in truths from good. [4] In Jeremiah: Jehovah bringeth back the captivity of the tabernacles of Jacob, and I will have compassion on his tents; and the city shall be built on her own heap, and the palace thereof shall be inhabited after its former manner (30:18)."

(What the rest signifies may be seen above, n. 724.) [5] In Isaiah: Enlarge the place of thy tabernacle, and let them stretch forth the curtains of thy tents; hinder not, make long thy cords, and make firm thy stakes (54:2). This is said of the barren that did not bear, by whom the Gentiles are signified with whom the church was to be established by the Lord. The state of the good of love of that church is signified by “the place of thy tabernacle;” and the truths from that good are signified by “the curtains of thy tents;” the fructification of good and the multiplication of truth are signified by “enlarging” and “stretching forth;” “cords” signifying the conjunction of these, and “stakes” their firmness. [6] In David: One thing have I asked of Jehovah, that will I seek, that I may dwell in the house of Jehovah all the days of my life, to behold the pleasantness of Jehovah, and to visit in the morning His temple; for He shall hide me in His tent in the evil day, He shall conceal me in the secret place of His tabernacle, He shall exalt me upon a rock (Ps. 27:4, 5).

Here, too, a “tabernacle” signifies the church in respect to the good of love, consequently also the good of love; “the mountain of holiness,” meaning Jerusalem, signifies the church in respect to the truths of doctrine from that good; which shows what is signified by “abiding in them.” “He that walketh in integrity” signifies one who is in good in respect to life and truths in respect to doctrine; therefore it is added, “who doeth justice and speaketh the truth;” “doing justice” signifying to be in good in respect to life, and “speaking the truth” to be in truths in respect to doctrine.

This describes the vastation of Arabia, by which the church that is in truths from good is signified; the goods of that church are signified by “their tabernacle and their flocks;” the truths of those goods by “the curtains and all vessels,” and the knowledges of truth by “camels.” “Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon” signifies the evils and falsities that lay waste. “The tabernacles of Arabia” have a like signification in David (Ps. 120:5). [13] In Jeremiah: To Zion shepherds and their flocks shall come, they shall pitch tabernacles against her, they shall feed down everyone his space (6:3).

[19] “Tabernacle” signifies the church in respect to good, or the good of the church, in the following passages also: That Jehovah would set a tabernacle in the midst of them, would walk in the midst of them, and be to them for a God (Lev. 26:11, 12); this was among the blessings: After the Lord was transfigured before Peter, James, and John, Peter said, Lord, it is good for us to be here; if Thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles; one for Thee, one for Moses, and one for Elijah (Matt. 17:4; Mark 9:5; Luke 9:33). I heard a great voice out of heaven, saying, Behold the tabernacle of God is with men, and He shall dwell with them (Rev. 21:3).

That this tabernacle was a representative of heaven and the church is clearly evident from this: That the form of it was shown to Moses upon Mount Sinai (Exod. 25:9; 26:30). And whatever is presented in a form to be seen in heaven and from heaven is representative. That the tabernacle was a repre-sentative of heaven itself, where the Lord is, and thence also of the church, is evident from its holiness: In that no one was permitted to enter into it except Aaron and his sons, and if the people drew near they would die (Num. 17:12, 13; 18:1, 22, 23; 19:14–19).

And them that dwell in heaven, signifies spiritual goods and truths, from which is the heavenly marriage. This is evident from the signification of “blaspheming them that dwell in heaven,” as being to falsify spiritual goods and truths. By “them that dwell in heaven” the angels are meant; and as the angels are angels from the reception of the Divine good and the Divine truth, and as the spiritual sense is abstracted from persons, “angels” here signify the goods and truths from which they are angels; and these are also signified by “angels” elsewhere in the Word (see above, n. 130, 302). “Angels” signify spiritual goods and truths because all who are in heaven are spiritual, and think and speak spiritually. But it is otherwise with men on earth, who being natural, think and speak naturally, and therefore goods and truths with them are natural. And as good and truth mutually love each other, and for that reason they must needs be conjoined, it is also said, from which is the heavenly marriage. This, too, is signified by “them that dwell in heaven,” since all in heaven are in that marriage, and this is why heaven is likened in the Word to a marriage; and there is a like marriage in every least particular of the Word, as may be seen above (n. 238 at the end, 288b, 484, 724a); also an angel cannot be an angel of heaven unless he is in that marriage, or unless that marriage is with him; and the like is true of the man of the church (see n. 660). From this again it is evident that a man who separates faith from good works is not a man of the church. From this it can now be seen that “to blaspheme them that dwell in heaven” signifies to falsify spiritual goods and truths from which is the heavenly marriage.

It now follows in order that something be said about those who, although they are in the churches where faith alone is acknowledged, still do not falsify the Word. These are (1) such as do not separate faith from the life but conjoin them by the belief that faith and life make one, like affection and thought, like will and understanding, like heat and light in the time of spring and summer, from the conjunction of which comes all germination, and like truth and good, when truth is put in place of faith, and good in place of life. On the conjunction of all these see the New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine. Such affirm within themselves that no one who lives wickedly can have faith, but only he who lives well, and that one who lives wickedly cannot receive faith unless he performs repentance of life by seeking out his evils and desisting from them; likewise that one who lives wickedly cannot, in his spirit or in himself, have any other faith than a belief in falsity, however he may profess with the mouth a belief in truth. Therefore the life of those who so conjoin life and faith in profession and in works is charity, and their faith is the thought that a thing is so in truth. The faith of such is spiritual so far as they know truths from the Word, and live according to them, for faith becomes spiritual from the life, and so far as man thence becomes spiritual heaven is opened to him.

These, when they act, believe that faith is believing that there is a God, a heaven and a hell, and a life after death; and that to love God and to love the neighbor is to do the commandments in the Word; and such, so far as they desist from evils and shun and turn away from them because they are sins, so far do the commandments from God, and not from themselves.

[2] The reasonings by means of which the defenders of faith separated from the life have induced upon falsities the appearance of truth, by which they have seemed to themselves to have cleared away the disagreements with the Word, have been treated of in several places before; but that they have not cleared away these disagreements, but have woven as it were an invisible spider’s web, that they might induce a faith in falsities, can be seen from what has been presented above (n. 780a, 781a,b, 786, 790a); also from this, that by doctrine, preaching, and writings, they assert and insist that faith was given as the means of salvation, because man is unable to do good of himself; also that God continues to operate whatever is good in man while man is unconscious of it, and by this operation the evils that are done by a man who is justified by faith are not sins but infirmities of nature; and that deliberate or voluntary evils are forgiven, either immediately or after some repentance of the mouth; and finally that it follows that by “works” and “doing,” in the Word, faith and to have faith are meant."

Thus for themselves and all the people of the church they give license and free rein to acting and living according to the bent and trend of all lusts; and as this dogma is pleasing to the flesh and to the eyes, the common crowd gladly receive it. This, therefore, is what is here signified by “it was given to the beast to make war with the saints and to overcome them.” But lest the leaders of the church, who are initiated into this dogma when they are initiated into the priesthood, and from them the people of the church, should be in fected by the poison drawn from these crafty reasonings, from which they cannot but die, I will take up again the arguments just mentioned respecting the separation of faith from the goods to be done by man, also the conjunctions fallaciously contrived, by which they proceed from something to nothing, or from truth to falsity, and I will present to the light before the understanding in any degree enlightened, the detestable falsities of evil and evils of falsity that are contained in that more than heretical dogma, and that gush forth from it in a constant stream. 802b. [4] First, “That faith was given as the means of salvation, because man is unable to do good of himself.” That man is unable to do good of himself is true; and as man is unable to have any faith of himself it follows that as he is not able to do anything from himself, so is he not able to believe anything of himself. For what man of the church does not acknowledge that faith is from God and not from man? Therefore altogether similar things must he said of faith as is said of works. Of works it is said, that in case they are from man, and while they are from man, they do not justify. It must be similar with faith in case it is from man and while it is from man. And yet everyone believes from himself, for he evidently thinks and wishes to think in himself as if from himself that which belongs to faith. Therefore if the same is true of faith as of works, it follows that the elect only can have faith and be saved; and this implies predestination, from which with the evil flow all kinds of"

Again, since the same is true of faith and of good works, it follows that man cannot act and should not act otherwise than as an automaton, or as a thing that has no life, waiting to be moved by influx from God, and thus go on thinking nothing and willing nothing that is commanded in the Word; and yet such a man is continually willing and thinking something from himself. But as that which is from oneself is not from God but from hell, and yet to think and will from hell is against God, and two opposites cannot exist together, such a man is either foolish or an atheist. If anyone after this shall say that because faith is given to be the means of salvation it can be received by man as of himself he will say what is true; but to have faith, that is, to think that a thing is so and from that to speak as of oneself, and yet to be unable to will a thing because it is so as of oneself, is to annihilate faith; for one without the other is a nonentity. But if anyone shall say that justifying faith is simply to believe that God the Father sent the Son, that by the passion of His cross He might effect propitiation, redemption, and salvation, and this does not involve anything to be done, also because it is imputation that saves, it follows (since there is no truth of heaven in such belief, as will be shown in its place) that a belief in falsity, which is a dead faith, justifies. [5] Secondly, “That still God operates what is good with man, while man is unconscious of it.” It is true that God operates what is good with man, and for the most part while man is unconscious of it, and yet God gives man the power to perceive the things that are necessary to salvation. For God operates that man may think and speak those things that belong to faith, and may will and do those things that belong to love; and when man thence thinks, speaks, wills, and does, he must needs think, speak, will, and do, as if of himself. God operates into those things in man that are from Himself with him; that is, into the truths that belong to faith and into the goods that belong to love; consequently when God presents the former in the understanding and the latter in the will they appear to man as if they were his own, and he brings them forth as his own.

This Divine operation itself often takes place while man is unconscious of it, but the effects that come from it man is conscious of. This is the meaning of the words: That man can receive nothing unless it be given him from heaven (John 3:27). Jesus said, Without Me ye can do nothing (John 15:5). If man had no consciousness in thinking truths and in doing goods, that they might not become goods and truths from himself, he would be either like an animal or like a stock; and thus would be unable to think and will anything of God or anything from God, thus would not be able to be conjoined with God by faith and love and live to eternity. The difference between animals and men is that animals are unable to think and speak truths and to will and do goods from God, while men are able to do this, and thus to believe those things that they think, and to love those things that they will, and this as if of themselves. If it were not as if of themselves the Divine influx and operation would flow through and not be received, for man would be like a vessel without a bottom, which receives no water. Man’s thought is the receptacle of truth, and his will the receptacle of good; and reception is not possible unless man is conscious of it. And if there is no reception there can be given no reciprocal, which makes that which is of God to be as if it were of man. Every agent that wills to conjoin himself with another must needs have something that is seemingly his own with which conjunction is effected, for otherwise there is no reagent; and where there is no action and at the same time reaction no conjunction is possible. The things in man with which God, who is the sole Agent, conjoins Himself, are the understanding and the will. These faculties are man’s; and although when they act they act from God, they cannot act otherwise than as if of themselves. From this it now follows that truths and goods that do not so act are not anything. But this shall be illustrated by examples. It is commanded in the Word that man must not commit adultery, must not steal, must not kill, must not bear false witness. It is known that man is able to do all these things of himself, also that"

When he calls murder a sin he lives in charity and loves charity, and this as if of himself. When he calls false testimony a sin he lives in truth and justice and loves truth and justice, and this as if of himself. And although he lives and loves these as if of himself, yet he lives and loves them from God; for whatever a man does from chastity itself, from sincerity itself, from charity itself, and from truth itself and justice itself, as if of himself, he does from God, and consequently they are goods. In a word, all things whatever that a man does from these principles as if from himself, these, when evils are removed, are from God and are goods. But all things that a man does before evils are removed, although they are works of chastity, works of sincerity, works of charity, or works of truth and justice, are not goods, because they are from man. Since all works, both those that are done from God and those that are not done from God, must needs be carried on by man or as if by him, it is evident why “works,” “deeds,” “working,” and “doing,” are so frequently mentioned in the Word, which would never have been so mentioned and commanded if they were done by God without man’s knowledge, as is taught in the interior meaning of the doctrine of those who separate faith from good works. [6] Thirdly, “That the evils that a man does who is justified by faith are not sins but infirmities of his nature; and that voluntary or deliberate evils are forgiven, either immediately or after some repentance of the mouth.” This is the profession of those who have inwardly examined and entered into the mysteries of the separation of faith from good works, with a difference with some according to the keenness of their ability to reason and draw conclusions. This, indeed, necessarily follows. For those who ascribe everything of salvation to faith alone, and ascribe nothing of salvation to good works, say that they are in grace, and some that they are in God;"

And as evils from the will, which are called in the Word “sinning with a high hand,” are not infirmities of nature, they say that they are forgiven, either immediately or after some repentance of the mouth, since he who has been justified by faith is in good and has no need of repentance of life; and some add, because these evils are done by permission. Again, this follows as a consequence from the belief that he who is justified by faith is redeemed, purified before God, and regenerated; and since he cannot do good of himself, that the merit of the Lord is ascribed and imputed to him, and by virtue of this imputation, together with redemption and regeneration, he is adopted as a son of God, and is led by God the Father, and enlightened by the Holy Spirit; consequently his works are accepted, and his evils are not evils like evils with others; and as they do not condemn they cannot be called sins, but infirmities, such as cling to everyone as an inheritance from Adam, and which, as soon as they come forth, are forgiven and cast out. These and various other opinions they assert, according to their ideas about the essence of faith, and its separation from the goods of life, or the conjunction of faith with those goods. But to investigate all these particulars is not necessary, for they are all streams from a false principle, from which nothing but falsities can flow forth in a continual series. Who does not know and acknowledge, when he thinks by himself, that man should examine himself, confess his sins be fore God, abominate them, and afterwards lead a new life, that he may inherit life eternal? This is taught in the appointed prayers in the churches, especially in those preparatory to observing the sacrament of the Supper; this is taught in the Word, and in all preachings from the Word; and reason that is at all enlightened declares it. And yet the light of this truth is extinguished as soon as anyone studies the arcana of this doctrine, and desires to gain a reputation for learning therefrom; for being led by the love of self and thence by the pride of self-intelligence, he departs from the faith of the common people, and embraces the falsity that destroys every truth of the Word and every truth of heaven.

It is a contradiction to say that doing goods means to have faith, when nevertheless the received faith not only separates good works but also excludes them from the means of salvation; and that which is separated and excluded from anything (thus from the faith which is said not only to be something but also everything), cannot possibly exist in it, and thus cannot be meant by it. It is also a contradiction to say that that which is saving and spiritual which is said to belong to faith—means at the same time that which is not saving and not spiritual; for they call faith saving and spiritual, but they call works not saving and so not spiritual. It is a false statement to say that the Divine operation, without any cooperation by man, is meant by “works” and “doing” in the Word when yet man is commanded to do these. It is also a false statement to say that “good works” mean the faith that is received and is called saving, when yet that faith is of the thought alone and not at all of the will. Furthermore they say that “works” and “deeds” are mentioned in the Word on account of the simple who do not grasp the arcana of faith.

Those born “not of bloods” are those who do not falsify the Word; those born “not of the will of the flesh” are those who are not in lusts from love of self; those born “not of the will of man” are those who are not in falsities from the pride of self-intelligence; those “born of God” are those who are regenerated by the Lord by means of truths from the Word and a life according to them; these are they who believe in the name of the Lord, and thence are called “sons of God.” Such a faith is not the faith of the teachers of the church at this day. 803a. And there was given to him authority over every tribe and tongue and nation, signifies domination over all the truths and goods of the church, and over the doctrine of faith and love.

[2] It is known that faith from love is the essential means of salvation, and thus is the principle of the doctrine of the church; but since it is important to know how a man can be in such enlightenment as to learn the truths that must constitute his faith and in such affection as to do the goods that must constitute his love, and thus can know whether his faith is a belief in truth and his love a love of good, this shall be told in its proper order, as follows: (1) Let him read the Word every day, one or two chapters, and learn from a master and from preachings the dogmas of his religion; and especially let him learn that God is one, and that the Lord is the God of heaven and earth (John 3:35; 17:2; Matt. 11:27; 28:18), that the Word is holy, that there is a heaven and a hell, and that there is a life after death. (2) Let him learn from the Word, from a master, and from preachings, what works are sins, and that they are especially adulteries, thefts, murders, false witness, and the others mentioned in the Decalog; likewise that lascivious and obscene thoughts are also adulteries, that frauds and illicit gains are also thefts, that hatred and revenge are also murders, and that lies and blasphemies are also false witness; and so on. Let him learn all these things from childhood to youth. (3) When man begins to think for himself, which is the case after he has grown up, it must be to him the first and chief thing to refrain from doing evils for the reason that they are sins against the Word, thus against God, and for the reason that if he does them he will gain, not life eternal, but hell; and afterwards as he grows up and becomes old he must shun them as damned, and must turn away from them in thought and intention. But in order to so refrain from them and shun and turn away from them, he must pray to the Lord for help. The sins he must refrain from and must shun and turn away from are chiefly adulteries, frauds, illicit gains, hatreds, revenges, lies, blasphemies, and elation of mind. (4) So far as man detests these evils because they are opposed to the Word, and thence opposed to God, so far there is granted him communication with the Lord, and conjunction is effected with heaven.

The reason is because man has been placed in the midst between heaven and hell, wherefore hell acts from the one side, and heaven from the other; therefore so far as evils that are from hell are removed, so far goods from heaven enter; for the Lord says: Behold I stand at the door and knock; if anyone hear and open the door, I will come in to him (Rev. 3:20). But if man refrains from doing these evils for any other reason than because they are sins, and are opposed to the Word and because thence to God, no conjunction of heaven with him is effected, because his refraining is from self, and not from the Lord. The Lord is in the Word, even so that He is called the Word (John 1:1–4), because the Word is from Him; consequently the conjunction of heaven with the man of the church is by means of the Word, as may be seen in the work on Heaven and Hell (n. 303–310). (5) So far, then, as man detests these sins so far good affections enter. Then so far as he detests adulteries so far chastity enters; so far as he detests frauds and unlawful gains so far sincerity and justice enter; so far as he detests hatred and revenge so far charity enters; so far as he detests lies and blasphemies so far truth enters; and so far as he detests elation of mind so far humility before God and love of the neighbor as oneself enter; and so on. From this it follows that to shun evils is to do goods. (6) So far as a man is in these good affections he is led by the Lord and not by self; and so far as he acts from them so far he does what is good, because he does this from the Lord and not from self; and then he acts from chastity, from sincerity and justice, from charity, from truth, in humility before God; and from these no one can act from self. (7) The spiritual affections that are granted by the Lord to him who is in them and who acts from them, are the affection of knowing and understanding the truths and goods of heaven and the church, together with the affection of willing and doing them; also the affection of combating with zeal against falsities and evils and dispersing them, both with himself and with others.

[3] If evils have not been removed because they are sins nothing that a man thinks, speaks, wills, and does, is good or true before God, however it may appear as if good and true before the world. The reason is that they are not from the Lord but from man, since it is the love of the man and of the world from which they are, and which is in them. Most people at this day believe that they will come into heaven if they have faith, live piously, and do goods; and yet they do not turn away from evils because they are sins, consequently they either do them or believe them to be allowable; and those who believe them to be allowable do them when opportunity is given. But let them know that their faith is not faith, that their pious things are not pious, and that their goods are not goods; for they flow from the impurities that lie inwardly concealed with man; and externals derive everything that they are from internals. For the Lord says: Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first the inside of the cup and of the platter, that the outside may become clean also (Matt. 22:26). From this it can now be seen that if a man were able to fulfill all things of the law, if he should give much to the poor, if he should do good to the fatherless and the widow, and if he should also give bread to the hungry and drink to the thirsty, take in the strangers, clothe the naked, visit the sick, and go to them that are bound in prison, if he should earnestly preach the Gospel, convert the Gentiles, frequent temples, listen devoutly to preachings, observe the sacrament of the Supper often every year, spend his time in prayer, and other things; and his internal has not been purified from hatred and revenge, from craftiness and malice, from insincerity and injustice, from the filthy delight of adultery, from the love of self and the consequent love of rule, and the pride of self-intelligence, from contempt of others in comparison with oneself, and from the other evils and their falsities; still all these works would be hypocritical and from the man himself, and not from the Lord.

I have there heard that it has been granted to many to recall the actions of their life in the world, and to enumerate the goods they had done; but when their internal was opened it was found to be full of every evil and the falsity therefrom; and it was then disclosed to them that the goods they had enumerated had been done from self, because for the sake of self and the world, and that they were full of evils from their interiors; and on this account they appeared either as if scorched with fire, or as if sooty. [4] But it was otherwise with those who from the Word had abstained from doing evils, and had afterwards shunned them and turned away from them because they were sins and were opposed to love to God and to charity towards the neighbor. Although there was a similar perception to them that their works were done as if from self, yet they were all good, and appeared in the light of heaven like white snow and wool (Isaiah 1:12–18). These are the works that are meant in the Word by the works that can in no wise be separated from faith; for faith separated from them is dead, and a dead faith is a faith in falsity from an evil love; or it is the thought that a thing is true, while the life is still evil. That abstaining from evils for any reason whatever except from the Word does not purify the internal man is evident from the origin of evil works and from the origin of good works. For example, he that abstains from adulteries from fear of the civil law and its punishments, from fear of the loss of reputation and thus of honor, from fear of deprivations arising from poverty, parsimony, or avarice, from fear of consequent illness, from fear of brawls at home with the wife and the consequent intranquility of life, from fear of chastisement by the servants of the injured husband, from infirmity arising from abuse, or age, or impotence, or even from natural goodness and consequent moral goodness, that is, as not being proper and honorable, and so on, and if for such reasons only he lives chastely still he is interiorly unchaste and an adulterer, so long as he does not abstain from these evils from spiritual faith, which is a belief that adulteries are infernal because they are"

That this is the signification of “worshiping” can be seen from what has been said above (n. 789, 790), where what is signified by “they worshipped the dragon which gave authority unto the beast, and they worshipped the beast” is explained. That they acknowledge from necessity is evident from what has been said and shown in the preceding article.

This is the reason for the necessity of acknowledgment by those who have been born within the church, which is signified by “all that dwell on the earth shall worship the beast.” [2] That this is so can be seen, in the first place, from the received faith which is called the only saving faith, “That God the Father sent His Son into the world, that through the passion of His cross He might effect propitiation, redemption, and salvation.” This faith if understood according to the ideas of those who defend faith separate from life, and thence according to preachings from their doctrine, is no faith; as is evident from each and every thing that is contained in that faith and that follows as a consequence from it; and these are: (1) That there is propitiation, that is, a propitiation of God the Father by the passion or by the blood of His Son. (2) That there is mercy or compassion of God the Father for the Son’s sake. (3) That there was a bearing of our iniquities by the Lord, and a consequent deliverance from them. (4) That there is an imputative principle, and thus an imputation of the Lord’s merit, through which we are saved. (5) That there is an intercession of the Lord with the Father. (6) That there is redemption and salvation without the means of life and faith, and thus there is immediate mercy."

But who does not see that for God the Father to reject from Himself the human race, or from justice to revenge their alienation, is contrary to the Divine essence itself, which is love itself, mercy itself, and goodness itself? Such vengeance, indeed, could not exist in any angel, and scarcely with any well disposed man, much less with God. Who does not also see that it is difficult to think that such vengeance was laid upon the Son by His Father, or that the Son took such vengeance upon Himself, and that God the Father has mercy from seeing or recalling this, and not from the Divine love itself, which in its essence is infinite, eternal, and immediate towards the whole human race?

Moreover, justice is a Divine attribute, but not vindictive justice, and still less can it be in one on another’s account; and if it is not justice neither is it according to Divine order for one to be saved on another’s account, though it may be by means of another. Nor can God be reconciled by any other means than by the repentance of the man himself. To be saved by means of the Lord, and also by means of the passion of His cross, thus by the Lord, is propitiation and expiation, as will be seen in what follows. (2) [4] “There is no mercy or compassion of God the Father for the Son’s sake.” The customary prayer in the churches, and by the men of the church at home and abroad, when they are in pious worship is, “May God the Father have mercy upon us for the sake of the Son, and for the sake of the passion of His cross.” This prayer flows from the accepted belief respecting the propitiation or reconciliation of the Father by the Son, as mentioned just above; likewise from the doctrine of the church respecting justification by faith alone without good works. And as the defenders and vindicators of that doctrine separate the life which is of good works from faith, they could acknowledge nothing else as a saving faith than that God the Father sent His Son, and that He is moved to mercy by the passion of His cross; and for this reason this prayer is at this day accepted by the general body as the only voice that can enter heaven and move God even if man utters it with a confession of trust only at the hour of death. And yet that such a prayer has in it nothing of life from truth and good, can be seen from what has been said just above respecting propitiation and reconciliation, and thence the mercy of the Father; also from what will be said presently respecting the bearing of our iniquities by the Lord, respecting the imputation of His merit, respecting intercession, and respecting redemption and salvation apart from life as a means. Here let it be said merely that it is never granted to any man of the church to approach God the Father immediately, and to pray to Him for the Son’s sake; for it is the Lord who must be approached and prayed to, since no one comes to the Father except by the Lord"

It is also to be known, that unless the Lord is approached man is unable to think with the angels, because all angelic thought about God is about God-Man. Angels are unable to think otherwise about God, and consequently about things Divine, because their thoughts go forth into every part of heaven; and heaven is heaven in the form of a man.

But what is signified by “carrying iniquities” has not yet been understood in the churches; therefore it shall be told. It was according to Divine order for the prophets to represent the state of their church, that its quality might thus be known, as can be seen from the following. Isaiah was commanded: To go naked and barefoot three years, for a sign and a wonder (Isa. 20:2, 3). In this way he represented that there were no longer any truths in the church; for this is signified by “going naked and barefoot.” Hosea was commanded:"

Also Ezekiel was commanded: To take to himself a tile and to portray upon it Jerusalem, and to lay siege against it; and to lie upon his left side three hundred and ninety days, and afterwards upon his right side forty days. Also he was commanded to eat a cake of barley made with cow’s dung; and it was said that so shall they be in want of bread and water in Jerusalem and shall pine away for their iniquity (Ezek. 4:1 to the end). This signified that the church was without goods and truths, and in mere falsities from evil; and it is said: That thereby he should bear the iniquity of the house of Israel (Ezek. 4:5). Yet he did not thereby take away their iniquities, but only represented them; and this because a “prophet” signified doctrine from the Word, thus the church in respect to doctrine and worship therefrom. The like is meant by “bearing iniquities” where these words are applied to the Lord, who was the greatest Prophet, for He represented in Himself how the Jewish Church treated with contumely the Divine truth or the Word, for He was Himself the Word; therefore their scourging Him, spitting in His face, smiting Him with a reed, setting a crown of thorns upon Him, giving Him vinegar to drink, dividing His garments, and finally crucifying Him, were all representative of the state of that church (see above n. 83, 195c, 627c, 655b). This, therefore, is signified by “bearing iniquities;” and in like manner also by His enduring temptations more grievous than those of all others. And yet to transfer to Himself the sins of others, and to take them away by sorrows and punishments admitted in Himself is contrary to the nature of the annulling of sins. For sins can be annulled only by repentance of life by him who has sinned. To take them away by drawing them from another upon oneself is a dogma of the Papists in which there is no truth."

These laws, with each and every thing that the doctrines of the churches teach from the Word, would be more than superfluous if man were saved by declaring with the confidence of faith that God has mercy on him for the sake of His Son and through the passion of His cross; and that thus the merit of the Lord would be imputed to him. For thus man might live wickedly, might commit adulteries, steal, act fraudulently, exercise hatred and revenge, calumniate, and other things, since be could not be saved by good works, but only by a faith that is wholly apart from any life. And yet it is blasphemy to say that a man can live wickedly and yet live from the Lord. It is likewise a contradiction that man must shun evils and do goods, and yet can be saved by mere faith in an imputed merit. The merit of the Lord is that from His own power He subjugated the hells and glorified His Human; by this He acquired for Himself the power to save all who believe in Him and who do what He taught. This merit cannot be attributed or imputed to anyone, still less can this be done by the Father, since it is the Lord’s own merit; and salvation also is by the Lord, thus through the Lord, and not for the Lord’s sake. In a word, no one’s merit can be attributed to another unless he is a sharer with him through his life, according to which everyone is rewarded or punished; but life is from the Lord; this follows from His merit. Moreover, anything imputative is contrary to the essence of Divine love, which extends to all; for to impute means to love one and not another except for the sake of the one; it is also contrary to justice, which requires that everyone should have reward to the extent that he lives from the Lord. (5) [7] “That there is intercession of the Lord with the Father” falls indeed into the ideas of men who are wholly simple, who think of the three Persons of the Divinity only as three sitting and talking together about what is to be, and that one moves the other to be merciful for His sake, which is to intercede.

(6) [8] “That there is redemption and salvation without the means of life and faith, and thus there is immediate mercy.” It is known that truths belong to faith, and goods to the life, and that without truths there can be no faith, as for example, without these truths: that there is a God, that the Lord is the Savior of the world, that there is a heaven and a hell, that there is a life after death, that the Word is holy, that the things that are in the Word must be believed and done, that the Holy Supper is the most holy thing of worship, and other like things; these must constitute faith; likewise that without goods there is no life of faith; for the Lord says: He that heareth and doeth not is like a foolish man that buildeth his house upon the ground without foundation; but he that heareth and doeth is like a prudent man that buildeth his house upon a foundation from the rock (Matt. 7:24, 26). These and like things, so far as they are to be believed, are means, and are said to belong to faith; and so far as they are to be done are means, and are said to belong to the life, without which man cannot be saved. All these things would be unmean ing, if in their place there were only this one thing which is called faith, namely, that man is saved by the mere mercy of the Father for the sake of the Son and by the imputation of His merit. That there is no such thing as immediate mercy, but mediate, and that yet man from pure mercy is led by the Lord from infancy to his old age, and afterwards to eternity, may be seen in the work on Heaven and Hell (n. 521–527). Thus neither is there any immediate salvation. From this it follows that redemption consists solely in the Lord’s redeeming from hell those who believe in Him, and who do what He has commanded; moreover, these, without His coming into the world, could not have been saved, since without His coming they could not have believed in Him, or have done what He has commanded, and thus have lived from Him. That these are those that are meant in the Word by “the redeemed” will be seen elsewhere."

To know this is called doctrine; and to believe it and live according to it is called religion. From doctrine man will know not only what must be thought but also what must be done; for man must think that he may do, but not think what involves doing nothing. The faith here described consists in thinking without doing, so that it may be called a mere cogitative (or thought) faith, while man implores mercy alone, because the Son of God suffered for him, and took upon Himself the sins of the world, and thus redeemed and delivered him from hell, believing at the same time that the merit of the Son of God is attributed to him. Let anyone who is willing and able consider whether there is in this anything of the Word, in which believing and doing are so often mentioned, consequently whether there is in this faith anything of the church or anything of religion. For in the things presented here, where are the truths that must constitute faith, and the goods that must constitute life, and that must make the genuine doctrine from the Word, and thus the theology of the Christian world? And as these things do not exist in that faith, it follows that it is not only a faith empty and void but also a faith in what is not true. It is a wonder to many in the spiritual world, and to all in heaven, that the theology of the Christian world has been reduced to such emptiness and vacuity that at length the whole of it is comprised in a mere utterance of thought that is possible also to the evil at the hour of death from a fear of hell. Thus the same emptiness that prevails with the Papists is found with very many of the Reformed in the Christian world. But let them consider, if they will, whether such as these can have any lot among the angels of heaven, whose intelligence is from the truths in the Word, and whose wisdom is from truths in act, which are called goods.

[12] But those who look to the Father, although they acknowledge the Lord’s Divine yet do not approach it; for they place it near the Father above the Human of the Lord, and thus they see His Human apart from His Divine, although His Divine is His soul. This is why many at this time confess the Divine of the Lord with the mouth, while but few acknowledge it in heart; and he who does not acknowledge the Divine of the Lord in His Human, and does not look to that in his supplications, cannot have any conjunction with heaven. From this it follows that in this faith, namely, that the Father should have mercy for the sake of the Son, there is no faith in the Lord nor any acknowledgment of His Divine in His Human.

The subjugation of the hells, together with the glorification of His Human, was accomplished by means of temptations admitted into the human that He had from the mother, and by continual victories therein. His passion in Gethsemane and on the cross was the last temptation and complete victory. [3] That the Lord came into the world for these two reasons, and that He thus saved the human race from eternal death, can be seen from this, that before the Lord’s coming the hells were not in order, and consequently there was no equilibrium between hell and heaven, but hell on its part prevailed over heaven. And yet man has been placed in the midst between heaven and hell; in consequence of this whatever before the Lords coming flowed into man out of heaven was taken away by hell, because of its superior power. Therefore to restore the destroyed equilibrium it pleased the Lord to come into the world, and to accomplish at that time a Last Judgment, and subjugate the hells; and by doing this the Lord acquired for Himself the power to save the men who have faith in and love to Him from Him. These things could be carried into effect only by the Lord’s assuming a Human, for the reason that God works such effects from first principles by means of ultimates, since to work from first principles by means of ultimates is to work in fullness. The very might of the Divine power rests in things ultimate; so the Lord’s might rests in His Human because that is in the ultimate. This was one reason of His coming into the world. The other reason was that He might glorify His Human, that is, make it Divine, since by this and by no other means is He able to keep the hells subjugated to eternity, for He thus acts to eternity from first principles by means of things ultimate, and in fullness.

This is called the redemption by His blood because the subjugation of the hells, together with the glorification of the Lord’s Human, could be effected only by means of temptations admitted into Himself from the hells, the last of which temptations was the passion of the cross. From this it can now be seen that the Lord did not come into the world to propitiate the Father and to move Him to mercy, nor to bear our iniquities and thus take them away, nor that we might be saved by the imputation of His merit, or by intercession, or by immediate mercy, consequently not by a faith in these things, still less by the confidence of that faith, since that confidence confirms such things as are not true, thus such things as do not belong to faith.

This is evident from the signification of “the Lamb slain or killed,” as being not acknowledged (see above, n. 315a, 328a, b), here that His Divine in His Hu man has not been acknowledged (of which presently). Also from the signification of “the foundation of the world,” as being the first establishment of the church. For “the world” signifies in the Word several things, namely, the world in general, also both those who are good and those who are evil in it, also the evil only who are in the world, and so also the hells. “The world” has also a similar signification as “the earth,” namely, the church; and that is also here meant by “the foundation of the world,” as also in Matthew: The King shall say to them on the right hand, Come, ye blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world (25:34). [2] The Lord is not acknowledged when His Divine in His Human is not acknowledged, for the reason that the Lord is not then regarded as God, but only as a man, who is not able to save. And although it is believed from the Athanasian Creed that the Lord is the Son of God born from eternity, and that His Divine is equal to the Divine of the Father, yet (since they separate His Human from His Divine) they divide the Lord as it were into two persons, which they call natures, making the Lord one thing as the Son of God from eternity, and another as the son of Mary. And because they so divide the Lord no one is able to approach Him unless he is willing to approach Him as one person when regarded as God and as another when regarded as man. Such has been the idea of the Lord from the first foundation of the church, as can be seen from the writings of the fathers, and afterwards from the writings of their sons. [3] The Lord has been thus divided in the church from its beginning, because they did not understand the Word. For where the Lord mentions the Father it is believed that a Divine distinct from His Human is meant, although it is clearly evident in Matthew and in Luke that the Lord was conceived by the very Divine which is called the Father, consequently that this very"

And what is wonderful, this is taught in express terms in the Athanasian Creed, which is the doctrine concerning God in the whole Christian world, and yet scarcely anyone in that confession gives any heed to it. That no heed has been given to it has been made clear to me from conversations with many in the other life, both the learned and the unlearned, who have said that it was unknown to them, and that they had thought of the Son of God from eternity as a Divine Person above His Human, sitting at the Father’s right hand. It was clear also that they had given no heed to those words of the Lord, that “the Father and He are One,” and that “the Father is in Him and He in the Father.” From this it can be seen that the church from its beginning has not acknowledged the Lord’s Divine in His Human, and that this is what is signified by “the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.” 808. Verse 9. If anyone hath an ear let him hear, signifies the reception by those who are in the understanding of truth, and the consequent perception of good. This is evident from the signification of, “If anyone hath an ear let him hear,” as being one who understands and hearkens to what the Lord teaches in the Word (see above, n. 108, 180, 255); thence these words signify also the reception of Divine truth by those who are in the understanding of it. Those who are in the perception of good are also meant, because “to have an ear and to hear” signifies both to understand truth and to perceive good; to understand truth pertains to thought, and to perceive good pertains to affection; and both pertain to the ear or to hearing, since what enters the ear passes into the sight of the understanding and also into the affection of the will; and for this reason the “ear” and “hearing” signify hearkening and obedience. So “to hear” anyone signifies to understand, and “to give ear to” anyone signifies to obey, and both are meant by “hearkening.” [2] As it has been shown above that in the faith received by the general body in the church there is mere emptiness, since there is nothing of life in it from any truth, I will here tell briefly what faith is saving faith. Saving faith is to believe that the Lord is the Savior"

Who those are that are able to receive truths from Him and to live according to them has been explained above (n. 803), namely, those who shun sins because they are sins against the Word and thus against God, since by so doing man’s internal is purified, and when this is purified man is led by the Lord and not by self; and so far as man is led by the Lord he loves truths, and receives them and wills them and does them. This faith is saving faith. [3] These words, “If anyone hath an ear let him hear” mean especially that it must be received and believed that the Divine of the Lord is in His Human, that is, that His Human is Divine. Is it not surprising that the idea of the Lord’s Divine Human has been altogether destroyed in the Christian churches, especially among the learned there, and that only with the simple does anything of it remain? For the simple think of God as a Man, and not as a Spirit without a human form as the learned do. The most ancient people, who were wiser than those of our days, had no other idea of God than as a Man encompassed about the head with radiant circles, as is shown by the writings of ancient men, and by their paintings and sculptures. Moreover, all who were of the church from the time of Adam down to Abraham, Moses, and the prophets, thought of God as a Man. They also saw Him in a human form, and called Him Jehovah, as is evident from the Word; and God under a human form is the Lord, as is clear from the Lord’s words in John: Before Abraham was, I am (8:58). [4] That the inhabitants of this earth from the primeval age had an idea of God-Man, or of the Divine Human, is evident from their idols, also from the ideas of such Gentiles as had interior thought and perception, like some of the Africans; likewise from the inhabitants of almost all the earths (as may be seen in a separate small work). Man has such an idea of the Divine because it flows in from heaven, for in heaven no one can think of God except in the human form. If he thinks otherwise his thought of God perishes,"

This is because the human form is the form of heaven, and all the thought of angels proceeds according to the form of heaven. Yet this idea of God, which is the chief of all ideas, is with the learned of the world at this day rooted out, as it were to such an extent that when it is merely said that God is a Man they are unable to think of it. [5] This is why, even from the first establishment of the church, they have separated the Divine of the Lord from His Human; and from this it has come to pass that few in thinking of the Lord think of His Divine, but they think of Him as a man like themselves. And yet with this idea of the Divine no one, whoever he may be, can enter heaven, but is repelled as soon as he touches the first threshold of the way that leads thither. This therefore, is what is especially meant by “If anyone hath an ear let him hear.” 809. Verse 10. If anyone shall lead into captivity he shall go into captivity; if anyone shall kill with the sword he must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints. 10. ”If anyone shall lead into captivity be shall go into captivity,” signifies that those who have shut out others from truths are shut out from the Divine truths in the Word (n. 810, 811); “if anyone shall kill with the sword he must be killed with the sword,” signifies that those who have imbued others with falsities are imbued with falsities from hell (n. 812). “Here is the patience and the faith of the saints,” signifies that through these comes temptation and afterwards the implantation of truth with those who are made spiritual by the Lord (n. 813). 810. Verse 10. If anyone shall lead into captivity he shall go into captivity, signifies that those who have shut out others from truths are shut out from the Divine truths in the Word. This is evident from the signification of “captivity,” as being to shut out from truths, here by reasonings from the natural man, for this is the spiritual captivity that is meant by “captivity” in the internal sense. (That this is what is meant in the Word by “captivity” will be seen in the following article.) Thence it is clear that “to lead into captivity” signifies to shut out others from truths; and “to go into captivity” signifies to be also shut out from truths. Here “to lead"

[2] Before proving from the Word that “captivity” signifies spiritual captivity, which is a shutting out from truths from the Word, I will first take up what was considered above (in article n. 805a ), which those who separate faith from life confirm by reasonings, and thus shut out others from truths; and in this way I will exhibit to view how they pervert truths and thence falsify the Word. It is to be known that those who are in truths can say the same things as those who are not in truths; for the latter prove the separation of faith from good works by the same passages of the Word as are used by the former to prove the conjunction of faith with good works. For the same expression may be used by two persons who disagree, and yet the perception be different; and it is the perception of a thing that causes it to be true or false. I have heard lovers of falsities speak in quite a similar way as those who were anxious to speak truths, and yet the latter were in truths and the former were in falsities, since they understood in a different way the things they expressed in a similar way, and according to their understanding they explained the passages from the Word; consequently by the one such passages were falsified, and by the other verified. For the truth in man is not a matter of speech, but of his perception; and this is why those who attempt to preach from the Word appear to be in truths, and yet when the same preach from doctrine about faith alone, redemption, the imputation of the Lord’s merit, and the like, they are in falsities. This may be illustrated by a thousand examples. In a word, it is the perception and not the speaking from the Word that falsifies. This is meant by these words of the Lord: Then two men shall be in the field; one shall be taken, the other shall be left. Two women shall be grinding; one shall be taken, the other shall be left (Matt. 24:40, 41). To be “in the field” signifies to be within the church, “to grind” signifies to investigate and learn truths from the Word; and one"

[3] As to propitiation by the blood of the Son, those who are in truths do not think about it as those do who are in falsities. Those who are in truths perceive by the propitiation by the blood of the Son that those who approach the Lord and pray to Him from the truths that are in the Word are received compassionately and are heard. “The Lord’s blood” signifies not only the passion of His cross, but also the Divine truth of the Lord that is in the Word; for by the passion of the cross the Lord subjugated the hells; and this is meant by His “conquering death and rising victorious,” as the leaders of the church say when they speak from the Word. By the passion of the cross the Lord also glorified His Human, and by this He keeps the hells forever subjugated. “The mercy seat” that was over the ark of the Testimony, upon which cherubs were engraved, has the same signification. How those who are in truths understand the bearing of iniquities by the Lord has been shown above (n. 805a ). [4] To those who are in truths the imputation of the Lord’s merit means simply an entreaty to the Lord that He will have mercy (who endured such cruel sufferings in order to redeem and save men, who would otherwise have perished in eternal death). The Lord’s merit means that by His own power He saved those who believe in Him, and who do what He has commanded. This merit cannot be imputed, but it can be prayed for. Intercession means the perpetual remembrance of man by the Lord. Trust and confidence mean trust and confidence in the Lord that out of pure mercy He will teach man the way and lead him to heaven. Thence it is also clear what is meant by redemption. [5] From this it can now be seen that the things presented above (n. 805a) do not mean, to those who are in truths from the Word,"

For, as has been said above, God is one and not three, and the trinity is in the Lord; consequently when the Lord is approached the Father and the Holy Spirit are at the same time approached. From this it can also be seen that “to lead into captivity” signifies to shut out from Divine truths in the Word. For those who hold the doctrine of three persons in the Divinity, and who separate faith from its life, which is good works, shut out others from the understanding of truth in the Word. For they explain all things in it according to their doctrine; and what they cannot explain they falsify. Moreover, the Divine which is in the Lord, and which is of the Lord Himself, they ascribe to the Divine of the Father, and thus do not approach the Lord; and because they do this, either by reasonings or by an explanation of the truths of the Word foreign to them, they shut out from the truth the people who believe that everything that is said about Divine things is above human comprehension; this is signified by “leading into captivity.” That they themselves “go into captivity,” that is, shut themselves out from the Divine truths in the Word, is evident from all things of their doctrine, in that while the things they speak are true as to statement they are not true in the way they understand them. This, too, has been testified to me by the state of such in the spiritual world, where it was found, when they were examined, that they were in mere falsities, and consequently could never be brought by the Lord into any heavenly intelligence. 811a. That “captivity” signifies in the Word spiritual captivity, which is a shutting out from Divine truths, that is, from the understanding of them in the Word, also destruction by the falsities of evil and by the evils of falsity, can be seen from passages in the Word where “captivity” is mentioned; as in the following. In Luke: They shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led captive among all nations; and Jerusalem shall finally be trampled down (21:24). This chapter treats of the consummation of the age, which means the last time of the church, when there is no longer any truth remaining. “To fall by the edge of the sword” at that time signifies"

[5] In David: God abandoned the habitation of Shiloh, the tent He inhabited among men; and He gave His strength into captivity, and His splendor into the hand of the adversary (Ps. 78:60, 61). “The habitation of Shiloh” signifies the church that is in the good of love, and the “tent” signifies the church that is in the truths of doctrine; thence it is clear what is signified by “God abandoned the habitation of Shiloh, the tent He inhabited among men,” namely, that the goods of love and the truths of doctrine have been destroyed. The “strength” that He gave into captivity signifies spiritual truth from celestial good; and “to give into captivity” signifies to shut out from an understanding of it, and thus destruction by falsities; and the “splendor that He gave into the hand of the adversary” signifies natural truth from spiritual; this is signified by “splendor;” and its destruction by evils is signified by “being given into the hand of the adversary.” [6] In Ezekiel: The prophet was commanded to remove out of the place, and to bring out the vessels of removal through the wall before their eyes, to bring them out in the darkness, and to cover his face that he see not the earth; and say, I am your prodigy; like as I have done, so shall it be done to them; they shall go into exile, into captivity (12:1–12).

Because the prophet represented these things it is said, “like as I have done, so shall it be done to them; they shall go into exile and into captivity.” Thence it is clear that “to go into exile” signifies the dispersion of truth, and “to go into captivity” signifies to be possessed by falsities. [7] In Habakkuk: I will raise up the Chaldeans, a nation that marcheth into the breadths of the land; it shall gather captivity like the sand; it shall mock at kings and rulers shall be a derision unto it (1:6, 9, 10). “The Chaldeans” signify those who destroy the truths of the church; “the breadths of the land” signify the truths of the church; that they will destroy all truths by falsities is signified by “it shall gather captivity like the sand;” that the truths and goods of the Word will be derided and blasphemed is signified by “that nation shall mock at kings, and rulers shall be a derision unto it,” “kings” signifying the truths of the Word, and “rulers” its goods.

This is said of the Lord; and “the poor” to whom Jehovah hath anointed Him to preach good tidings signify those who are in few truths, and yet desire truths that their soul may be sustained by them; “the broken in heart” signify those who in consequence are in grief; “the captives” to whom He was to preach liberty signify those who are shut out from truths and thus from goods; and to these truths are to be opened, and by them they will be imbued with goods. The “bound” and the “blind” signify those to whom it is denied to see truths, meaning the Gentiles that afterwards received truths from the Lord. [19] In the same: I have raised him up in justice, and I will make straight all his ways; he shall build My city and he shall let go My captivity, not for price nor reward (Isa. 45:13). This, too, is said of the Lord; and the “justice” in which Jehovah hath raised him up signifies the good of love; and “his ways which He will make straight” signify the truths proceeding from good; the “city which he shall build” signifies the doctrine of the church; and the “captivity which he shall let go” signifies the opening and revelation of Divine truths with those who had heretofore been"

Their Redeemer is strong; pleading He will plead their cause, and will give quiet to the land (50:33, 34). This also is said of the Lord, who is meant by “their Redeemer is strong;” “to plead their cause” signifies visitation and judgment upon those who oppress them by falsities, and consequent deliverance from them; “to give quiet to the land” signifies protection from falsities, “the sons of Israel and the sons of Judah,” who are said to be oppressed, do not mean the sons of Israel and of Judah, but the Gentiles that are in truths and goods from the Lord; and as these are restrained by those who deceive them and shut out truths from them, it is said that “those that take them captive hold them fast, and refuse to let them go.” [21] In David: Thou hast ascended on high; Thou hast led captivity captive (Ps. 68:18). This, again, is said of the Lord; and “to lead captivity captive” signifies to deliver from the falsities that have held them captive. In Isaiah: Shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or shall the captivity of the just be delivered? For thus Jehovah hath said, Even the captivity of the mighty shall be taken, and the prey of the violent shall be delivered (Isa. 49:24, 25). This also is said of the Lord, and of the bringing back of the sons of Zion from captivity; and “the sons of Zion” mean those who are in love to the Lord and in truths therefrom.

When Jehovah shall bring back the captivity of His people Jacob shall exult, Israel shall be glad (Ps. 14:7; 53:6). Here also “Zion” means those who are in the good of love from the Lord; deliverance from evils by the Lord and salvation are meant by “Who will give out of Zion the salvation of Israel?” “To bring back the captivity of His people” means deliverance from falsities and evils; “Jacob shall exult, Israel shall be glad,” means the joy with those who are in the external church and of those who are in the internal church because of their deliverance, “Jacob” meaning those who are of the external church, and “Israel” those who are of the internal church; and both mean the Gentiles. [23] In Jeremiah: Fear not, My servant Jacob, and be not dismayed, O Israel; behold I will keep thee from afar, and thy seed from the land of thy captivity, so that Jacob may return, and be quiet and tranquil, and none shall make him afraid (46:27; 30:10). Here, too, “Jacob and Israel” mean the Gentiles, “Jacob” those who are of the external church, and “Israel” those who are of the internal church; “to keep them from afar” signifies to save them although they are far from salvation; “to keep from the land of captivity” signifies to deliver from the falsities by which they have been shut out from the truths and goods of heaven and the church; “to return and be quiet and tranquil, and none shall make afraid,” signifies to be protected from falsities which are from hell. [24] In the same: All that devour thee shall be devoured; and all thine adversaries, all shall go into captivity; and they that plundered thee shall be for plunder; and all that preyed upon thee will I give for a prey.

[25] In the same: I will be found of you, and I will bring back your captivity, and I will bring you together out of all nations, and I will bring you back to the place whence I caused you to depart (Jer. 29:14). This, too, describes the deliverance of the Gentiles from spiritual captivity, which is a shutting out from the truths and goods of heaven and the church, whereby salvation is effected. In Zephaniah: In that time I will bring you, and in time will bring you together unto Me, for I will give you for a name and a praise to all the peoples of the earth, when I bring back your captivity before your eyes (3:20). This, too, means the bringing back of the Gentiles from spiritual captivity. In Amos: I will bring back the captivity of My people Israel, that they may build the waste cities and inhabit them, and plant vineyards and drink the wine thereof; and they shall make gardens and eat the fruit of them (9:l4).

In the verses that follow it is said of the sons of Israel: That they sojourned in Egypt, and that Assyria oppressed them (Isa. 4); which signifies that they were shut out from truths by reasonings from the knowledges (scientifica) of the natural man. [27] In the same: The peoples shall take them and shall lead them to their place, and the house of Israel shall possess them for a heritage upon the land of Jehovah, for manservants and for maidservants; that they may thus take captive them whose captives they were, and they shall have dominion over their exactors (Isa. 14:2). This, too, treats of the bringing back of the sons of Israel, and by sons of Israel the Gentiles are meant.

This treats of the state of the church among the Jews about the time of the Lord’s coming; “Ephraim’s whoredom,” which is “the filthy thing in the house of Israel,” signifies the falsification of the Word; “whoredom” signifying falsification, and “Ephraim” the understanding of the Word. “Israel is polluted, and Judah hath set a harvest for thee,” signifies that the church was in mere falsities, and that they applied the Word to confirm falsities, “Judah” signifying the Word, and “harvest” the abundance of such things in the Word as they applied. That this would be the state of the Jewish Church when truths should be opened before the Gentiles, by which they might be delivered from falsities, is signified by “when I shall bring back the captivity of My people.” [29] In the historical parts of the Word the captivities of the sons of Israel by various enemies, and their deliverances, have a like signification, as: That they were forced to serve Cushan, king of Syria, and were delivered by Othniel (Judges 3); That they served Eglon, king of Moab, and were delivered by Ehud (Judges 3); That they were given over to Jabin, king of Canaan, and delivered by Deborah (Judges 4); That they were given over to the Midianites, and delivered by Gideon (Judges 6); That they were given over to the Philistines and Ammonites, and delivered by Jephthah (Judges 10, 11).

By the blood of thy covenant I will send forth the bound out of the pit wherein is no water (Zech. 9:11). The sighing of the bound shall come before Thee (Ps. 79: 11).

But no other falsities but the falsities of evil close heaven. For there are various kinds of falsities, for instance, falsities of ignorance, falsities of religion, and falsities from misunderstanding the Word; in a word, the falsities that lead to a life of evil, or that proceed from a life of evil, because they are from hell close heaven. From this it is clear that “if anyone shall kill with the sword he must be killed with the sword” signifies that those who imbue others with falsities will be imbued with falsities from hell. [2] There is a like signification in what the Lord said to Peter: All they that take the sword must perish by the sword (Matt. 26:52). This was said to Peter because he represented the truth of faith, and also the falsity of faith; therefore “to take the sword and to perish by it” signified to receive the falsity of faith, and to perish by it. Those who are signified by this “beast,” who are such as by reasonings confirm the separation of faith from life, “kill with the sword, and are killed with the sword,” that is, imbue others with falsities, and are themselves imbued with falsities from hell, because the dogma of faith alone shuts out all truths and rejects all goods. Faith alone shuts out all truths because such insist that we are saved solely by this, “That the Lord endured the cross for our sins, and thereby took away the condemnation of the law, and that He thus redeemed us.” And as they hold that this alone, which they call faith itself, saves, they make no effort to learn truths, although truths are what teach man how he must live, and these truths are manifold. That faith alone rejects goods follows from the dogma itself, which is that faith justifies without good works; thus the essential goods of love to God and the goods of charity towards the neighbor are made of no account. 813.

This is evident from the signification of “the patience of the saints” (of which presently); also from the signification of “faith,” as being the implantation of truth; also from the signification of “saints,” as being those who are in truths from good from the Lord (see above, n. 204), thus those who are made spiritual by the Lord; for man is made spiritual by truths from good. “Faith” signifies the implantation of truth because faith with man is truth acknowledged in the heart; for unless it is acknowledged in the heart it cannot be one’s own faith; and this is why “faith” is nowhere mentioned in the Old Testament, but “truth” instead; and indeed, the ancient people with whom was the church were wholly ignorant that faith was anything else than truth; and when they said that they believed in God they meant by it knowing and understanding truths, and willing and doing them, and this from the Lord. Thence it is clear that “faith” signifies the implantation of truth. [2] “The patience of the saints” signifies the temptation of the faithful, or of those who are made spiritual by the Lord, because “patience” signifies spiritual patience, which is patience in sustaining temptations; and those have that patience who fight in themselves against the falsities that are contained in the dogma of faith alone and that adhere to it; for that faith is confirmed by reasonings from the natural man and from the Word wrongly applied and thus falsified. The temptations that such sustain when they fight against falsities are meant by “patience.” [3] “Patience” has a like signification in Luke: Ye shall be delivered up by parents and brethren, and kinsfolk and friends; some of you shall they cause to be put to death; yea, ye shall be hated by all for My name’s sake: in your patience possess ye your souls (21:16, 17, 19). This is said of the last time of the church, when judgment takes place. The temptations that the faithful will then undergo on account of truths are described by “they shall be delivered up by fathers, brethren, kinsfolk, and friends, and be put to death,” also “shall be hated for the sake of the Lord’s name;” “parents, brethren,"

[4] Again, in the same: They who are sowed in the good land are those who in a simple and good heart hear the Word and hold fast, and bring forth fruit in patience (Luke 8:15). “To bring forth fruit in patience” signifies to do truths and goods even when living amid falsities and evils, that is, among those who are in falsities and evils. The Lord’s patience in temptations, of which He suffered the most grievous of all, is described in these words in Isaiah: He endured persecution and He was afflicted, yet like a lamb He opened not His mouth (53:7). “Enduring persecution” signifies temptations; “to be afflicted” signifies their grievousness; “to open not His mouth” signifies patience. 814.

This is evident from the signification of “the two beasts” treated of in this chapter, as being the confirmation of those things that are signified by “the dragon,” for “the dragon” signifies especially faith alone (see above, n. 714); and “the beast coming up out of the sea” signifies reasonings from the natural man confirming the separation of faith from life (see also above, n. 774); therefore this “beast” signifies confirmations from the sense of the letter of the Word in favor of faith separated from life, and the consequent falsifications of the truth of the church. That “the dragon” is further described by these two “beasts” is evident from verses 2, 4, 11, of this chapter. There are moreover two means by which any heretical dogma may be confirmed, namely, by reasonings from the natural man and by confirmations from the sense of the letter of the Word; and these two means are what are signified by these two “beasts.” The former “beast” signifies reasonings from the natural man, because the “sea” out of which that beast came up signifies the natural of man, while this “beast” signifies confirmations from the sense of the letter of the Word, because the “earth” out of which it came up signifies the church where the Word is. This “beast” signifies also falsifications of the Word, because the Word unless it is falsified can never confirm a false dogma, since all things of the Word are truths; consequently all truths can be confirmed from the Word, but by no means falsities, as can be clearly seen from what has been said above and also from what follows in this chapter. 815b.

In Matthew: There came a centurion to the Lord, saying, Lord, I am not worthy that Thou shouldst come under my roof; but say the word only, and my boy shall be healed. Jesus hearing, marveled and said to them that followed Him, Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith in Israel. And He said unto the centurion, Go thy way, and as thou hast believed be it done unto thee; and his boy was healed in that hour (8:8, 10, 13). The Lord healed this person and others according to their faith, because the first and primary thing of the church then to be established was to believe that the Lord is God Almighty, for without that faith no church could have been established. For the Lord was the God of heaven and the God of earth, with whom no conjunction is possible except by an acknowledgment of His Divinity, which acknowledgment is faith. The centurion evidently acknowledged the Lord to be God Almighty, for he said, “I am not worthy that Thou shouldst come under my roof; but say the word only, and my boy shall be healed.” [4] In the same: A woman afflicted with an issue of blood touched the hem of Jesus’ garment; for she said within herself, If I shall but touch His garment I shall be healed. Jesus turning and seeing her, said, Daughter be of good cheer, thy faith hath made thee whole; and she was healed in that hour (Matt. 9:20–22). In the same: They brought unto Him one sick of the palsy lying on a bed; Jesus seeing their faith, said unto the sick of the palsy, Be of good cheer, thy sins are forgiven. Arise, take up thy bed, and go unto thy house (Matt. 9:2–7; Luke 5:19–25). In the same: Two blind men cried, saying, Have mercy on us, Thou Son of David.

No other faith than that which is called historical, which at that time was a miraculous faith, was meant by this faith whereby the sick were healed; consequently by this faith many wrought miracles at that time. This faith was, that the Lord was Almighty, because He was able to do miracles of Himself; for this reason He also allowed Himself to be worshiped, which was not the case with the prophets of the Old Testament, who were not worshiped. But there must always be this historical faith before it becomes a saving faith; for a historical faith becomes a saving faith with man by his learning truths from the Word, and living according to them. [5] In the same: A woman of Canaan, whose daughter was vexed by a demon, came and worshiped Jesus, saying, Lord, help me. Jesus said unto her, Great is thy faith; be it done unto thee as thou wilt; and her daughter was healed (Matt. 15:22–28). In John: A ruler whose son was sick besought Jesus to heal his son before he died. Jesus said unto him, Go thy way, thy son liveth; and the man believed in the word that Jesus spake unto him. And his servants met him, saying, Thy son liveth. Therefore he believed, and his whole house (4:46–53).

He said unto him, Thou hast both seen Him and He it is that speaketh with thee. He said, Lord, I believe; and he worshiped Him (John 9:35–38).

In the same: Jesus said to the blind man, Thy faith hath saved thee; and immediately he was able to see (Luke 18:42, 43). In Mark: Jesus said to the disciples, when they were unable to heal a certain man’s son15 who had a dumb spirit; to whom Jesus said, If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth; the father of the boy crying out with tears, said, Lord, I believe, help thou mine unbelief; and he was healed (9:17, 23, 24). There were three reasons why faith in the Lord healed these; first, because they acknowledged His Divine omnipotence, and that He was God; secondly, because faith is acknowledgment, and from acknowledgment intuition; and all intuition from acknowledgment makes another to be present; this is a common thing in the spiritual world. So now, when a new church was to be established by the Lord, it was this intuition from an acknowledgment of the Lord’s omnipotence from which they were first to look to the Lord; and from this it is clear what is here meant by faith. The third reason was, that all the diseases healed by the Lord represented and thus signified the spiritual diseases that correspond to these natural diseases; and spiritual diseases can be healed only by the Lord, and in fact by looking to His Divine omnipotence and by repentance of life. This is why He sometimes said, “Thy sins are forgiven thee; go and sin no more.” This faith also was represented and signified by their miraculous faith; but the faith by which spiritual diseases are healed by the Lord can be given only through truths from the Word and a life according to them; the truths themselves and the life itself according to them make the quality of the faith.

In Luke: Jesus said to the woman who was a sinner, and who made His feet wet with her tears, and wiped them with the hair of her head, and kissed His feet, which she also anointed with oil, Thy sins are forgiven thee; thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace (7:38, 48, 50). From this it is clear that it was faith in the Lord’s omnipotence that healed them, and that the same faith remitted, that is, removed, sins. The reason of this was that this woman not only had faith in the Divine omnipotence of the Lord, but also loved Him, for she kissed His feet. Wherefore the Lord said, “Thy sins are forgiven thee, thy faith hath saved thee,” because faith makes the Divine of the Lord to be present, and love conjoins. It is possible, however, for the Lord to be present and not be conjoined; from which it is evident that it is faith from love that saves.

When the disciples could not heal the lunatic, Jesus said unto them, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? and Jesus healed him; and He said to the disciples that they could not heal him by reason of their unbelief (Matt. 17:14, seq.).

For faith presents the Lord as present, as has been said above; but faith in Him as a man only does not present His Divine omnipotence as present. For the same reason those in the world at the present day who look to His Human alone and not at the same time to His Divine, as the Socinians and Arians do, cannot be saved. [8] And for a like reason the Lord could not do miracles in His own country, for there they had seen Him from infancy like another man; and therefore they were unable to add to that idea the idea of His Divinity; and when that idea is not present while the Lord is present, He is not present in man with Divine omnipotence; for faith presents the Lord as present in man according to the quality of the perception of Him. Other things man does not acknowledge and therefore rejects; for in order that the Lord may operate anything with man by faith the Lord’s Divine must be present in man, and not outside of him. [9] In John: Many of the multitude believed on Jesus, and said, When the Christ shall come, will He do more signs than those which this one hath done? (7:31).

And they went forth and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them and confirming the Word by signs following (16:17–20). As the Jewish nation believed in Jehovah solely because of miracles, it is evidently a miraculous and not a saving faith that is here meant; for they were external men, and external men are moved to Divine worship only by external things, like miracles which forcibly strike the mind. Moreover, a miraculous faith was the first faith with those among whom a new church was to be established; and such a faith is also the first with all in the Christian world at this day, and this is why the miracles performed by the Lord were described, and are also now preached. For the first faith with all is a historical faith, and this afterwards becomes a saving faith when man by his life becomes spiritual; for first of all it is to be believed that the Lord is the God of heaven and earth, and that He is omnipotent, omnipresent, omniscient, infinite, and one with the Father. These things must be known; but so far as they are merely known they are historical, and a historical faith presents the Lord as present, because it is a looking to the Lord from His Divine nature. And yet that faith does not save until man lives the life of faith, which is charity; for he then wills and does what he believes, and to will and to do is of the love, and love conjoins to Him whom faith presents as present. The signification of those miracles that the disciples were to do, and that were done by them in the beginning of the Christian church, as casting out demons, speaking with new tongues, and others, may be seen above (n. 706c). [10] In Matthew: Jesus said, Verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place, and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you (17:14–20).

In Matthew: Jesus said to the disciples, If ye have faith and doubt not, ye shall not only do this which has been done to the fig tree, but even if ye shall say unto this mountain, be thou lifted up and cast into the sea. And all things whatsoever ye shall ask believing in Me, ye shall receive (21: 21, 22). In Luke: If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed ye would say unto this sycamine tree, Be thou rooted up and be thou planted in the sea, and it would obey you (17:6). That this is to be understood otherwise than according to the words is evident from its being said to the disciples, that “If they had faith as a grain of mustard seed they would be able to pluck up a mountain or a sycamine tree from its place, and cast it into the sea;” also that “all things whatsoever they asked they should receive;” and yet it is not according to Divine order for one to receive what he asks if he only have faith, or for the disciples to pluck up a mountain or a tree from its place and cast it into the sea. But “faith” here means faith from the Lord, consequently it is called “the faith of God,” and he who is in faith from the Lord asks for nothing but what contributes to the Lord’s kingdom and to himself for salvation; other things he does not wish, saying in his heart, Why should I ask for what does not contribute to this use? Therefore if he were to ask for anything except what it is granted him from the Lord to ask he would have no faith of God, that is, no faith from the Lord. It is impossible for angels of heaven to wish and so to ask for anything else, and if they were to do so they could have no faith that they would receive it. The Lord compared such faith to the ability and power to cast a mountain or sycamine tree into the sea, because the Lord spake here as well as elsewhere by correspondences, and therefore these words must be understood spiritually.

This comparison of the ability and power of faith from the Lord with plucking up and casting a mountain and a sycamine tree into the sea was also made because in the spiritual world such things actually take place. There these loves of evil sometimes appear as mountains, and the faith in falsity from evil as a sycamine tree; and both of these an angel can root up and cast into hell through faith from the Lord. (That a “mountain” signifies love to the Lord, and in the contrary sense the love of self, see above, n. 405, 510; and that a “fig tree,” or a “sycamine tree,” signifies the natural man in respect to its goods and truths, and in the contrary sense the same in respect to evils and falsities, see above, n. 403.) 815c.

For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him may not perish, but may have eternal life. He that believeth in Him is not judged; but he that believeth not hath been judged already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God (3:14–19). In the same: The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into His hand; he that believeth in the Son hath eternal life, but he that believeth not the Son shall not see life, but the anger of God abideth on him (John 3:35, 36).

This is signified by “His name,” because in the spiritual world names that are given to persons are always in accord with the quality of their affection and life, and in consequence the quality of each one is known from his name alone. So when anyone’s name is pronounced, and the quality that is meant by the name is loved, that one becomes present, and the two are united as companions and brethren. The quality of the Lord however is everything of faith and love by which He saves man, for that quality is the essence proceeding from Him; therefore when that quality is thought of by man the Lord becomes present with him, and when this quality is loved the Lord is conjoined to him. Thence it is that those who believe in His name have eternal life. This shows how necessary it is that man should know the quality of faith and love, that is, the Lord’s “name;” also how necessary it is to love that quality, which comes by doing those things that the Lord has commanded. The names “Jesus” and “Christ” moreover involve this same quality, since “Jesus” means salvation, and “Christ” or “Messiah” Divine truth, which is everything of faith and love as to knowledges, doctrine, and life. When, therefore, these names are mentioned their quality must be thought of and they must live according to it. This is what is meant by the words of the Lord in Matthew: Jesus said, If two of you on earth shall agree in My name respecting anything that they shall ask it shall be done for them by My Father who is in the heavens. For where two or three are gathered together in My name there am I in the midst of them (18:19, 20). There is, indeed, a presence of the Lord with all and also a love towards all; and yet man cannot be led and be saved by the Lord except in the measure of his reception of the Lord by faith in Him and love to Him. [13] This shows how necessary it is for man to know the quality of faith and love, that is, the Lord’s name, also to love it, since the Lord can be loved only through His quality.

Therefore to approach the Father and not the Lord is to make two out of one, and thus to worship apart from the Lord the Divine that is in Him. And this destroys in man the idea of Divinity in respect to the Lord, which again makes evident the truth: That he that believeth in the Son hath eternal life (John 3:36).

The disciples say, In this we believe that Thou camest forth from God (John 16:26–30). “To come forth from the Father” signifies to be conceived of Him, and “to go to the Father” signifies to be fully united to Him. That “to come forth from the Father” means to be conceived of Him is clearly evident from His conception (Matt. 1:18–25; and in Luke 1:34, 35). That “to go to the Father” means to be fully united to Him is evident from the glorification of His Human by the passion of the cross, which has been spoken of above; and therefore He says, “In that day ye shall ask in My name,” and no more in the name of the Father.

That the Jews did not believe is evident in John 5:14–47; 10:24–26; 12:37–49; Matt. 21:31, 32. The cause of their unbelief was their wish for a Messiah who would exalt them to glory above all the nations in the world; also that they were wholly natural and not spiritual; also that they had falsified the Word, especially where it treats of the Lord and also of themselves.

Upon the head of this beast two horns only were seen, but upon the head of the former beast ten horns, because this beast signifies confirmations from the Word; and in the Word there is the marriage of good and truth, and this marriage is signified by “two.” So, too, the horns appeared “like a lamb,” because a “lamb” means the Lord, here the Lord in relation"

That the Lord in respect to His Divine Human is the Word, that is, the Divine truth, is declared in the plainest terms in John: That the Word became flesh (1:14). [2] Such a power of persuading and confirming any heresy whatever from the Word is well known in the Christian world from the many heresies there, everyone of which is confirmed from the sense of the letter of the Word and thus they are persuaded. The reason is that the sense of the letter of the Word is accommodated to the apprehension of the simple, and therefore consists in large part of appearances of truth; and it is the nature of appearances of truth to be capable of being adapted to confirm anything that anyone may adopt as a principle of religion and thence of doctrine, thus even when it is false. Consequently those who place genuine truth itself in the sense of the letter of the Word only, are open to many errors unless they are in enlightenment from the Lord, and in that enlightenment form doctrine for themselves that will serve them as a lamp. In the sense of the letter of the Word there are naked truths as well as truths clothed, and these latter are appearances of truth, and appearances of truth can be understood only from passages where naked truths stand out; out of these doctrine can be formed by one who is enlightened by the Lord, and according to that doctrine all other things can be explained. This is why those who read the Word without doctrine are led into manifold errors. The Word was so written in order that there might be a conjunction of heaven with man; and there is a conjunction because every expression in the Word, and in some passages every letter, contains a spiritual sense, in which the angels are; consequently when man perceives the Word according to its appearances of truth the angels that are about man understand it spiritually. Thus the spiritual of heaven is conjoined with the natural of the world in respect to such things as contribute to man’s life after death. If the Word had been written otherwise no conjunction of heaven with man would have been possible.

For this reason the sense of the letter of the Word is most holy, and is even more powerful than its spiritual sense, as has been made known to me by much experience in the spiritual world, for when spirits bring forward any passage according to the sense of the letter they immediately excite some heavenly society to conjunction with them. From this it can be seen that all things of the doctrine of the church are to be confirmed from the sense of the letter of the Word that there may be in them any sanctity and power, and moreover from those books of the Word in which there is a spiritual sense. Thence it is also evident how dangerous it is to falsify the Word even to the destruction of the Divine truth that is in its spiritual sense; for by so doing heaven is closed to man. That this is done by those who confirm by the Word the separation of faith from its life, which is good works, has been shown above. 817a. And he spake as a dragon, signifies with a similar affection, thought, doctrine, and preaching, as belong to those who separate faith from the life of faith, which is charity. This is evident from the signification of “speaking,” as being affection, thought, doctrine, and preaching. This is the signification of “speaking” because all the speech of man is from affection and the consequent thought. The affection itself is expressed by the sound of the speech, and the thought by its words. The affection and the thought are both of them in the speech, as everyone who reflects can see. The affection alone by itself cannot speak, it can only make a sound and sing; nor can thought alone by itself speak otherwise than as an automaton without life, since it is the affection that gives life to every expression of speech; and this is why a man is regarded by others according to the affection of his speech and not according to the words he utters. “To speak” signifies also to preach from doctrine, thus doctrine and preaching therefrom, because it is said that the beast “spake as a dragon;” and a “dragon” means those who are in faith separated from charity both in doctrine and in life (see above, n. 714); and this beast means confirmations from the sense of the letter of the Word in favor of the separation of faith from life, and the resulting falsifications of the Word; consequently"

For there have been several churches on this earth, namely, the Most Ancient, which was before the flood; the Ancient, which was after the flood; the Jewish, which followed the Ancient; and lastly the Christian Church.

The church that adulterated all the goods of the church is described in the Word by the “Babylonians and Chal deans;” and the church that falsified all the truths of the church is described by “Cain,” by “Reuben,” and by the “Philistines,” and by the “he-goat” in Daniel which fought with the ram and overcame it.

What these stories involve in the spiritual sense and what the names of the persons there signify has been explained in the Arcana Coelestia. “Cain” signifies the knowledges of truth and good separated from a life according to them, thus from heavenly love, and “Abel” signifies heavenly love; or what is the same, “Cain” signifies truth separated from good, and “Abel” good conjoined with truth. And as truth is the first thing of the church, since every church is formed by means of truths, because every church begins from truths or from the knowledges of truth and good, therefore Cain was the firstborn, and was named “man (vir) of Jehovah,” “man of Jehovah” signifying in the Word the truth of heaven and the church; and the “ground” which Cain tilled signifies the church. The separation of truth from good is signified by the murder of Abel by Cain; for when everything of the church is placed in truths or in knowledges, and not in goods or in the affection of living according to truths, good with its affections is slain. And as everything of the church perishes when truth is separated from good, so Cain “was cast forth from the ground,” which, as has been said, signifies the church. But because truths are the first things of the church, for life must be learned from truths, “a sign was set on Cain, lest someone should slay him; and it was decreed that if anyone should slay him he should be avenged sevenfold.” And because truth without good is carried hither and thither, having nothing to lead it, and consequently falls successively into falsities, and departs from the way that leads to heaven, so Cain “was cast forth from the face of Jehovah, and became a wanderer and fugitive.” The like is true of faith and charity, since faith is of truth and charity is of good; so when faith is separated from charity what is said of Cain takes place, namely, that “it kills Abel its brother,” which is charity, and in consequence the church perishes, which is signified by “being cast forth from the"

[4] It has been shown above (n. 434), that “Reuben,” the firstborn of Jacob, signified the light of truth and thence the understanding of the Word, and thus truth from good or faith from charity, as did the apostle Peter; and that conversely, “Reuben” represented truth separated from good, or faith separated from charity, and that this faith is signified by his adultery with Bilhah his father’s concubine, in consequence of which the birthright was taken away from him and given to Joseph. To this may be added, that all heresies, so far as they are adulterations and falsifications of the Word, correspond to adulteries and whoredoms of various kinds, and these because of this correspondence are actually perceived in the spiritual world from those who are in heresies. The reason of this is that marriages as they exist in the heavens derive their spiritual origin from the conjunction of good and truth; and conversely, adulteries derive their origin from the conjunction of evil and falsity; and this is why heaven is compared in the Word to a marriage, and hell to adultery. And as there is in the hells the conjunction of evil and falsity, so there continually exhales therefrom a sphere of adultery. It is for this reason that “adulteries and whoredoms” signify in the Word the adulterations of the good of the church and the falsifications of its truth (see above, n. 141, 161). [5] In respect to faith separated from charity, this is perceived in the spiritual world as the adultery of a son with a mother as also with a stepmother. This is so because that faith shuts out the good of charity; and when this is shut out the evil of the love of self and of the world takes its place, and that faith conjoins itself with that love. For every kind of faith must necessarily conjoin itself with some love; therefore when spiritual love, which is charity, is separated, faith then conjoins itself with the love of self or with the love of the world, which are the loves that are dominant in the natural man; and this is why so heinous an adultery results from faith separated from charity. From this then it is clear what is signified by the adultery of Reuben with Bilhah his father’s"

This is also meant by the prophecy of Israel his father respecting Reuben: Reuben my firstborn, thou art my power and the beginning of my vigor; excelling in exaltation and excelling in strength; light as water, thou shalt not excel, because thou wentest up to thy father’s bed, then thou didst profane it, he went up to my couch (Gen. 49:3, 4). These words may be seen explained in the Arcana Coelestia (n. 6341–6350). That such adultery is perceived in the spiritual world from faith separated from charity has been made evident to me from correspondences in that world. For whenever I have perceived afar off the sphere of adultery with a mother or stepmother, I have known at once that those who had confirmed themselves in faith alone both in doctrine and in life were near, and they were also then discovered; and when they had been explored they were found to have been such in the world. 817d. [6] So much respecting Reuben; we will now speak of the Philistines; these also in the Word represent faith separated from love. It was for this reason that they were called the “uncircumcised;” for “one uncircumcised” signifies one who is destitute of spiritual love, and is solely in natural love, and with that love alone no religious principle can be conjoined, much less anything of the church; for every religious principle and everything of the church has regard to the Divine, to heaven, and to spiritual life; and these cannot be conjoined with any other than a spiritual love; but not with a natural love separated from a spiritual love; since natural love separated from spiritual love is man’s own (proprium), and this, regarded in itself, is nothing but evil. All the wars that the sons of Israel waged against the Philistines represented the combats of the spiritual man with the natural man, and thence also the combats of truth conjoined with good against truth separated from good, which in itself is not truth but falsity. For truth separated from good is falsified in the idea of the thought respecting it, and for the reason that there is nothing spiritual present in the thought to enlighten it.

[7] Because this religion exists in the churches with all who love to live a natural life, so in the land of Canaan the Philistines were not subjugated, as the other nations of that land were, and consequently there were many battles with them. For all the historical things of the Word are representative of such things as pertain to the church; and all the nations of the land of Canaan represented things heretical confirming either the falsities of faith or the evils of the love; while the sons of Israel represented the truths of faith and the goods of love, and thus the church. But what was represented by the wars that the inhabitants of the land of Canaan carried on will be told in its place and time; here it shall merely be shown that the Philistines represented a religious principle separated from spiritual good, such as is the religious principle of faith alone separated from its life, which is charity. This is why the sons of Israel whenever they fell away from the worship of Jehovah to the worship of other gods were given over to their enemies, or were conquered by them: Thus they were given over to the Philistines, and served them eighteen years, and afterwards forty years (Judges 10; 13). This represented their departure from the worship from the good of love and the truths of faith to worship from the evils of love and the falsities of faith. Likewise: The sons of Israel were conquer ed and distressed by the Philistines (1 Sam. 4; 13; 28; 29; 31). But when the sons of Israel returned to the worship of Jehovah, which was the worship from the good of love and the truths of faith, they conquered the Philistines (1 Sam. 7, 14; 2 Sam. 5, 8, 21, 23; 2 Kings 18).

[8] Thus in Isaiah: Rejoice not, O Philistea, all of thee, because the rod that smiteth thee is broken; for out of the serpent’s root shall come forth a basilisk, whose fruit shall be a fiery flying serpent. Then the firstborn of the poor shall feed, and the needy shall lie down in safety; and I will kill thy root with famine, and he shall slay thy remnant.

What then shall one answer, ye messengers of the nation? That Jehovah hath founded Zion, and in her the afflicted of His people shall hope (14:29–32). This describes Philistea, which signifies the church, or those in the church who indeed are in truths from the sense of the letter of the Word or from some other revelation, and yet are in filthy loves, consequently their truths are not living truths; and truths not living are turned into falsities when they are brought from exterior thought, which is the thought next to the speech, into interior thought, which belongs to the understanding, also when this thought considers truths in their origin, which those who are meant by “the Philistines” do not see. They do not see for the reason that while every man, even an evil man, has a faculty to understand, he has no good of the will, which is the good of life; for this good springs from love to God and from love to the neighbor, and it is these loves that cause that faculty to communicate with heaven and receive enlightenment therefrom. [9] This chapter in Isaiah describes those who are in truths without good, and shows that with such all truths are turned into falsities. This, therefore, is the spiritual sense of these words: “Rejoice not, O Philistea, all of thee, because the rod that smiteth thee is broken,” signifies that they should not rejoice because they are permitted to remain in their heresy by reason of the fewness of those who are in truths from good; “for out of the serpent’s root shall come forth a basilisk” signifies that out of the sensual man a dogma destructive of all truth will arise; “the serpent’s root” being the sensual, which is the ultimate of man’s life, and “the basilisk” being the destruction of all truth. “Whose fruit shall be a fiery"

In like manner “the basilisk” has a similar signification as “the dragon,” which is also called “a serpent;” and “the fiery flying serpent” has a similar signification as “the beast coming up out of the sea and the beast out of the earth,” in this chapter of Revelation. “Then the firstborn of the poor shall feed, and the needy shall lie down in safety,” signifies that when that dogma is received by those who are natural and sensual men, and who believe themselves to be wiser than others, truths from good with those who desire what is true and will what is good, will become living; “the firstborn” in the Word signify truths born from good; the “poor” those who are not in truths but who still desire them, and the “needy” those who are not in goods but who in heart will them. “And I will kill thy root with famine, and he shall slay thy remnant,” signifies that all truths, from the first of them to the last, will be destroyed by falsities. “Howl, O gate; cry out, O city,” signifies that no entrance will be granted to any truth, and that doctrine will be made up of mere falsities, “gate” signifying entrance to the truths of doctrine, and “city” doctrine. “Thou whole Philistea art dissolved” signifies the destruction of that church by mere falsities. “For from the north cometh a smoke” signifies that every falsity from evil will break in from hell, “the north” meaning hell, and “smoke” the falsity of evil. “And none shall be alone in thy assemblies” signifies that there shall not remain a single truth among their knowledges. “What then shall one answer, ye messengers of the nation?” signifies the enlightenment of those who are in the good of life from love to the Lord. “That Jehovah hath founded Zion” signifies that a church shall be established from them; “and in her the afflicted of His people shall hope” signifies that those who are not in wisdom from self, and who conquer in temptations against such falsities, shall have intelligence and salvation. [10] The vastation of truth by falsities with those who are meant by “the Philistines” is also described by Jeremiah 47:1–7; likewise in Ezekiel 25:15, 16; in Joel 3:4–6; in Amos 1:8.

Their religious principle was also represented by their idol called Dagon, which was set up in Ashdod, and which, according to their description, was formed like a man from the head to the navel, and like a fish from the navel downwards; its being like a man from the head to the navel represented the understanding derived from truths; and like a fish from the navel downwards represented the natural destitute of the good of love; for the lower part down to the knees corresponds to celestial love, and a “fish” signifies the natural man which is without spiritual good. (That “man” [homo] signifies the affection of truth, may be seen above, n. 280; that his “head” signifies the understanding of truth and intelligence therefrom, n. 553; that a “fish” signifies the natural man, n. 513; and that the generative organs signify from correspondence celestial love, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 5050–5062. Moreover, the “emerods” with which the Philistines were smitten when the ark of God was held captive by them, signified truths defiled by evils of life; but these and other things related about them in 1 Sam. 5 may be seen explained above, n. 700e.) [11] Truth defiled by evil of life is signified also by “the uncircumcised” (2 Sam. 1:20; Ezek. 28:10; 31:18; 32:18, 19; 44:9). For the foreskin corresponds to corporeal love, because the member which it covers corresponds to spiritual and celestial love. And because “the Philistines” represented those who are in knowledge (scientia) and cognitions of truth without any spiritual and celestial good, they were called “uncircumcised.” And as the sons of Israel were also actually of the same character, in order that they might nevertheless represent the church which is in spiritual and celestial good and in truths therefrom, it was commanded that they should be circumcised. From this it can be seen that the religious principle at this day that separates charity from faith is in the representative sense Philistea. 817e. [12] So much respecting the Philistines.

The common opinion is that the “goats” there mean all the evil, and it has not been known heretofore that the “goats” there mean those who are in faith separated from charity, and the “sheep” those who are in faith from charity. In a good sense “goats” mean those who are in natural good and in truths therefrom, which truths are called the knowledges (cognitiones) of truth and good from the natural sense of the Word. Such as these, or such good and such truth therefrom, are signified by the goats that were sacrificed. That there were also sacrifices of goats is evident from Lev. 4:23; 9:2–4, 8–23; 16:2–20; 23:18,19; Num. 15:22–29; 28:11–15, 18 to the end; 29; and elsewhere. For all the beasts that were offered as sacrifices signified such things as pertain to the church, all of which have reference to goods and truths. The celestial goods and the truths therefrom in which are the angels in the third heaven were signified by “lambs,” while the spiritual goods and truths in which are the angels in the middle heaven were signified by “rams,” and the natural goods and truths therefrom, in which are the angels who are in the lowest heaven, were signified by “goats.” Celestial goods and truths are with those who are in love to the Lord; but spiritual goods and truths are with those who are in love towards the neighbor; and natural goods and truths with those who live well according to truths from natural affection. This is the signification of these three kinds of beasts in various parts of the Word (as in Ezek. 27:21; Deut. 32:14). [13] But as most things in the Word have also a contrary sense, so “goats” signify in that sense those who are in faith separated from charity, for the reason that they are more lascivious than other animals, and that they signify in the genuine sense those who are in natural good and the truth thence, and all who are in faith separated from charity both in doctrine and in life are merely natural. That such are meant in the Word by “goats” has been shown me to the life in the spiritual world. There various beasts are seen; but they are not such beasts as exist in our world, that is, not beasts that have been born, but they are correspondences of the affections and of the thoughts therefrom of spirits and angels; consequently as soon as those affections and the thoughts therefrom vary and cease, these beasts vanish out of sight.

Moreover, when rams and sheep were sent among them these goats being kindled with anger rushed upon them, and strove to throw them down, but in vain. For in the spiritual world goats have no power against the rams or sheep, therefore the goats were overcome. Afterwards it was granted me to see the same as men; and this was a proof that the goats were identical with those who had lived in the world in faith separated from charity. [14] From this what is signified by the “ram” and the “he-goat,” and “the battle between them,” in the eighth chapter of Daniel can be seen, namely, that the “ram” there means those who are in faith from charity, and the “he-goat” those who are in faith separated from charity. Thus the future state of the church is there described, namely, that faith separate would dissipate all charity, which is the good of life, and falsity therefrom would have rule in the Christian world. To illustrate this, I will present a summary of what is related in Daniel respecting the ram and the he-goat, as follows: Daniel saw in vision a ram that had two horns, one higher than the other, but the higher came up last; and he made himself great. But then a he-goat of the goats came from the west over the faces of all the earth; and he charged upon the ram and smote him, and broke his two horns; and he cast the ram down to the earth, and trampled upon him. The he- goat had a horn between his eyes, and when this was broken there came up four horns in its place towards the four winds of the heavens; and out of one of them came forth one horn which grew exceedingly, even to the host of the heavens, and cast down some of the host and of the stars to the earth and trampled upon them. Yea, it exalted itself even to the prince of the host, and the continual burnt offering was taken away from him, and the dwelling place of his sanctuary was cast down; and it cast down the truth to the earth (8:1–14, seq.). That the “ram” here means those who are in faith from charity, and the “he-goat” those who are in faith separated from charity, may be seen above (n. 316c and n. 573a), where the same things are explained; therefore I pass by any further explanation."

Likewise in Zechariah: Mine anger was kindled against the shepherds, and I will visit upon the he-goats (10:3). From this it can be seen that the goats and the sheep in Matthew (25:31 to the end) have the same meaning; consequently works of charity only are there enumerated which were done by the sheep, and were not done by the goats. That such are there meant by the “goats” was proved also when the Last Judgment was accomplished upon those who belonged to the Christian Church; for then all those who were in faith separated from charity both in doctrine and life were cast into hell; and all who were in faith from charity were kept safe. 818.

From this it can be seen that this beast’s “exercising all the authority of the first beast before the dragon” signifies the connection of reasonings from the natural man with the sense of the letter of the Word, by which the religion of faith separate is confirmed. [2] The connection of reasonings from the natural man with the sense of the letter of the Word is meant, because nothing false can ever be confirmed by the sense of the letter of the Word except by means of reasonings from the natural man. For the Word in the letter consists of appearances of truth and also of correspondences, and both of these in their bosom, that is, in their spiritual sense, contain genuine truths; consequently when any falsity is confirmed by the appearances of truth that correspond to genuine truths the Word is falsified; and the falsification of the Word can be effected only by reasonings from the natural man. This is why “the dragon,” which signifies the heretical dogma of faith alone, is further described by two beasts, by the first of which reasoning from the natural man in favor of faith separated from its life, which is charity, is described; and by the other, confirmation from the sense of the letter of the Word, and thus corroboration of it, also the falsification of truth, are described; from which it is again evident that this beast’s “exercising all the authority of the first beast before the dragon” signifies the connection of reasonings from the natural man with the sense of the letter of the Word. But these things shall be illustrated by examples.

For they reason by saying that faith alone includes deeds and works, because those who are in faith are also in these, thus they are wrought by faith; when in fact, faith without deeds or works is a dead faith, by which nothing can be wrought. If this is said to them they argue that deeds are nevertheless present by a secret Divine operation, although they exclude them from being a means of salvation, thus that they may be present and not be present, as can be seen from justification by instantaneous faith, and also in the hour of death, even in the case of evil men. (2) It is a reasoning from the natural man that faith separate from goods of life is also spiritual, and yet the goods that are of love are what give life to faith, and make it spiritual. For love is the very soul of faith, and love is doing, for what a man loves he wills, and what he wills he does. And this the Lord teaches in John: He that hath My commandments and doeth them, he it is that loveth Me; but he that loveth Me not keepeth not My words (14:21, 24). Thence it is clear that faith without works is not spiritual; for it is without its soul, and faith without its soul is a dead faith. (3) It is also a reasoning from the natural man that faith was made the means of salvation because man cannot do good of himself. (4) It is also a reasoning from the natural man that those who are merely in faith are in God and in a state of grace, even so that nothing can condemn them. From this it is believed by many that it is not necessary to live a Christian life, which is according to the Lord’s commandments; for they say to themselves, Why should I give any thought to works, when good works do not save and evil works do not condemn? I have faith that the Lord suffered the cross for the sins of the world, and delivered us from the condemnation of the law; what more is necessary? (5) It is a reasoning from the natural man that faith alone is like a seed from which all kinds of salvation spring forth like shrubs and trees from seed in gardens; and yet in faith alone there is no seed of life except what is from the spiritual life of man.

And yet when the intellectual sight is excluded man is blind, and before a blind man falsities can be confirmed as well as truths, and even better than truths, because with one who is blind fallacies which are darkness avail more than truths themselves which are in light. Shut up the understanding, bring forth reasonings, and cite confirmations from the sense of the letter of the Word, and you will persuade yourself of anything you wish, especially in theological matters that ascend into the interior of the rational mind. [4] These are called reasonings from the natural man, because the natural man is in the delights of the love of self and of the world; and these delights, when they prevail, cause man to believe only such things as agree with them, which in themselves are falsities. They also induce darkness in everything spiritual, even to the extent that man shuns heavenly light, and thus rejects all enlightenment of the understanding. The reason is that the natural man, separated from the spiritual, regards only self and the world, and not the Lord and heaven; and thus he is conjoined to hell, which is the source of all falsities; and these can never be dissipated except by the prevalence of heavenly love and by genuine truths which are from that love. This, then, is why these are called reasonings from the natural man, and why reasonings from the natural man are what falsify the Word; for the Word cannot be falsified except by reasonings from the natural man. 820a.

[2] And as truth from good, which is from the Lord, is the first thing of the church, Peter was the first to be called by his brother Andrew, and afterwards James and John were called, as is evident in Matthew: Jesus walking by the sea of Galilee saw two brethren, Simon called Peter and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishers. And He said unto them, Come ye after Me, and I will make you fishers of men. And straightway leaving their nets they followed Him (4:18–20). In John: Andrew findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messiah, which is, being interpreted, the Christ. And therefore he brought him to Jesus. And Jesus looking upon him, said unto him, Thou art Simon the son of Jonah; thou shalt be called Cephas, which is, by interpretation, Peter (1:41–43) In Mark: Jesus going up into a mountain calls unto Him whom He would, first Simon upon whom He conferred the name Peter, and afterwards James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James (3:13, 16, 17).

From this it is clear that truth is the first thing through which man has the church. But it must be truth from good, for truth without good is mere knowledge that a thing is so; and mere knowledge does nothing except to make a man capable of becoming a church; but this is not effected until he lives according to knowledges. Then truth is conjoined to good, and man is introduced into the church. Moreover, truths teach how a man ought to live; and when man is affected by truths for the sake of truths, which is done when he loves to live according to them, he is led by the Lord, and conjunction with heaven is granted him, and he becomes spiritual, and after death an angel of heaven. Nevertheless it is to be known that it is not truths that produce these effects, but good by means of truths; and good is from the Lord. Because truth from good, which is from the Lord, is the first thing of the church, Peter was the first to be called, and was the first of the apostles, and he was also named by the Lord “Cephas,” which means a rock; but, that it might be the name of a person, he is called Peter. In the highest sense “rock” (petra) signifies the Lord in relation to Divine truth, or Divine truth proceeding from the Lord; consequently in a relative sense “rock” signifies truth from good, which is from the Lord, the like is meant by Peter. (That “rock” has this signification see above, n. 411. But what “Simon son of Jonah” signifies see also above, n. 443a ). [3] These three apostles were fishermen, and the Lord said unto them, “Come ye after Me, and I will make you fishers of men,” because “to fish” signifies to instruct natural men; for there were at that time, both within the church and outside of it, natural men who became spiritual as they received the Lord and received truths from Him. [4] From this the signification of the Lord’s words to Peter concerning the keys may be deduced; as in Matthew: When some had said that Jesus was John the Baptist, others Elijah, others Jeremiah or another of the prophets, Jesus said to the disciples,"

And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon son of Jonah; for flesh and blood hath not revealed this unto thee, but My Father who is in the heavens. And I say also unto thee, Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of the heavens, and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in the heavens; and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in the heavens (16:14–19). This was said by the Lord to Peter because truth from good, which is from the Lord, is the first thing of the church, and this was what Peter signified; and this was said when he acknowledged the Lord to be the Messiah or the Christ, and to be the Son of the living God; for without such an acknowledgment truth is not truth, because truth derives its origin, essence, and life from good, and good from the Lord. Because truth from good, which is from the Lord, is the first thing of the church, therefore the Lord says, “upon this rock will I build My church.” It has been said just above that “Peter” or “Rock” signifies in the highest sense Divine truth proceeding from the Lord, and in a relative sense truth from good, which is from the Lord. That “the gates of hell shall not prevail” signifies that falsities from evil, which are from the hells, will not dare to rise up against those of the church who are in truths from good from the Lord, “the gates of hell” signifying all things of hell, for there are gates to all the hells through which falsities from evil exhale and rise up. “The keys of the heavens” signify the introduction into heaven of all those who are in truths from good from the Lord; “whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in the heavens, and whatsoever thou shalt loose on the earth shall be loosed in the heavens,” signifies that heaven is opened by the Lord to those who are in truths from good from Him; and that it is closed to those who are not. These things were said to Peter; but because “Peter” means truth from good, which is from the Lord, they were said of the Lord, who is the source of good and its truth; and this is why they were said when Peter acknowledged the Lord to be the Messiah or the Christ, and the Son of the living God. Moreover, as soon as good is implanted in truths with man he is conjoined with the angels; but so long as good is not implanted in truths with man heaven is closed to him; for he then has evil in place of good, and falsities in place of truths.

[5] That “Peter” signifies truth from good, which is from the Lord, has been made manifest to me from heaven, as may be seen in the work on the Last Judgment (n. 57). Because “Peter” signified truth from good which is from the Lord, and consequently also doctrine, and thus he represented those who are in truths from good and in the doctrine of genuine truth from the Lord, and since such as these instruct others, and are instructed by the Lord, therefore Peter so often spoke with the Lord and was also instructed by the Lord. He spoke with the Lord at His transfiguration: About making three tabernacles (Matt. 17:1–5; Mark 9:2–8; Luke 9:26–36). The Lord then represented the Word, which is Divine truth; and “tabernacles” signify the worship of the Lord from the good of love and truths therefrom. (See above concerning the Lord’s transfiguration, n. 594a; and concerning the signification of tabernacles, n. 799.) He spake about the Lord: That He was the Christ, the Son of the living God (John 6:67–69). He was taught by the Lord: Respecting charity, that a brother must be forgiven as often as he sinned (Matt. 18:21, 22). Respecting regeneration, which is signified by the one who having once bathed has no need except to wash his feet (John 13:10); Respecting the power of truth from good from the Lord, which is meant by the power of those who have the faith of God (Mark 11:21, 23, 24); Respecting sins, that they are forgiven to those who are in faith from love (Luke 7:40–48);"

Matt. 17:24–27); as well as many other things (respecting which see Matt. 14:26–31; 19:27, 28; Mark 10:28, seq.; 13:3, seq.; 16:7; Luke 22:8, seq.; 24:12, 33, 34; John 18:10, 11; 20:3–8; 21:1–11). 820b. [6] It was because Peter represented those who are in truths from the good of love to the Lord, or in doctrine from truths, and these are they who instruct others, that the Lord said to Peter when he replied that he loved Him, that “he should feed His lambs and sheep,” respecting which in John: When they had breakfasted, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon son of Jonas, lovest thou Me more than these? He saith unto Him, Yea, Lord, Thou knowest that I love Thee. He saith unto him, Feed My lambs. He saith to him again, Simon son of Jonas, lovest thou Me? He saith unto Him, Yea, Lord, Thou knowest that I love Thee. He saith unto him, Feed My sheep. He saith unto him the third time, Simon son of Jonas, lovest thou Me? Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time, Lovest thou Me? And he saith unto Him, Lord, Thou knowest all things; Thou knowest that I love Thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed My sheep (21:15–17). From this it is clearly evident that Peter represented truth from the good of love to the Lord, and this is why he was now called Simon son of Jonas, for “Simon son of Jonas” signifies faith from charity; “Simon” signifies hearkening and obedience, and “Jonas” means a dove, which signifies charity. That those who are in the doctrine of truth from love to the Lord are to instruct those who will be of the Lord’s church is meant by the Lord’s asking, “Lovest thou Me?” and afterwards by “Feed My lambs” and “My sheep.” Not that Peter only would instruct, but all those who were represented by Peter, who, as has been said, are those who are in love to the Lord, and thence in truths from the Lord. Peter was asked three times to signify the full time of the church from its beginning to its end, for this is the signification of “three;” so when he was asked the third time it is said that “Peter was grieved.”"

And when He had thus spoken He saith unto him, Follow Me. Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved, following; which also leaned on His breast at supper. Peter, seeing him,17 saith to Jesus, Lord, but what about this one? Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? Follow thou Me. This saying therefore went forth among the brethren, that that disciple should not die. Yet Jesus said not unto him that he should not die, but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? (21:18–23). What all this signifies no one can know unless he knows that “Peter” signifies faith from charity, and also faith without charity, faith from charity in the church at its beginning, and faith without charity when the church comes to its end; thus “Peter when he was younger” signifies the faith of the church in its beginning, and “when he became old” the faith of the church coming to an end; and “to gird himself and walk” signifies to learn truths and live according to them. From this it is evident that “I say unto thee, when thou wast younger thou girdedst thyself and walkedst whither thou wouldst,” signifies that the church in its beginning will be instructed in truths that are from good, and by means of them will be led by the Lord; and that “When thou shalt be old thou shalt stretch forth thine hands and another shall gird thee, and lead thee whither thou wouldst not,” signifies that the church at its end will not know truths, but falsities that belong to faith without charity, and will be led by them, “to gird oneself” like as “to be clothed” signifying to be instructed in truths, because “garments” signify truths clothing good (see above, n. 195, 395, 637), and “to walk” signifying to live according to truths (see above, n. 97); consequently “to gird himself and walk whither he would” signifies to consider freely and to see truths, and do them; while “to stretch forth the hands” signifies not to be in such freedom; for “the hands” signify the power of truth from the understanding and perception of it, and “to stretch forth the hands” signifies not to have that power, thus neither the freedom to think and to see"

This faith is what is now meant by “Peter,” and therefore it is said that Peter turning about saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following, and said of him, “But what about this one?” likewise that Jesus said to Peter, “What is that to thee?” “The disciple following Jesus” signifies the goods of life, which are good works; and that these will not perish to the end of life is signified by the words that here follow. [8] From this it can now be seen that “Peter” signifies also faith separated from charity, as also when: Peter thrice denied the Lord (Matt. 26:69–75; Mark 14:29–31, 54, 66–72; Luke 22:33, 34, 50, 51, 55–62; John 13:36–38; 18:16–18, 25–27). Also when the Lord, turning away from Peter, said to him, Get thee behind Me, Satan, thou art a stumbling-block unto Me; for thou savorest not the things that are of God, but the things that are of men (Matt. 16:21–23). Also when the Lord said to him, Simon, Simon, Behold Satan demanded you that he might sift you as wheat (Luke 22:31). All these things have been cited to make known that “Peter” in the representative sense signifies in the Gospels truth from good, which is from the Lord; also faith from charity; and also in the contrary sense truth separated from good, which in itself is falsity; also faith separated from charity, which in itself is not faith. 821a. And he maketh the earth and them that dwell therein to worship the first beast, signifies in consequence of which those in the church who are in falsities and in evils therefrom acknowledge the agreement in heart.

(That “the earth” signifies the church in respect to truths and in respect to falsities see above, n. 304, 413b, 417a, 697, 741, 752; and that “those that dwell” signify the good in the church, and also the evil, and in an abstract sense goods or evils, see above, n. 479.) The above is evident also from the signification of “worshiping,” as being to acknowledge as certain, to acknowledge in heart, and to believe (see above, n. 790a, 805a); also from the signification of “the first beast,” as being reasonings from the natural man confirming the separation of faith from the life (see above, n. 774), here the agreement of reasonings with the sense of the letter of the Word, because this “beast” signifies confirmations therefrom (see also above, n. 815a). From this it is clear that the words “the beast coming up out of the earth maketh the earth and them that dwell therein to worship the first beast” signifies that those in the church who are in falsities and in evils therefrom acknowledge the agreement in heart. 821b. [2] In the preceding article it was shown that “Peter” signified truth and faith in both senses, namely, truth from good and truth without good; so also faith from charity and faith without charity. Something shall now be said about the apostle John, as signifying the works of charity. It has been said above that the twelve apostles, like the twelve tribes of Israel, represented the church in the whole complex, or all things of truth and good, or all things of faith and charity; likewise that Peter, James, and John, signified faith, charity, and the works of charity, in their order; from which it follows that when they were together they represented these as one. It is said as one, because without charity there is no faith that is faith; and without works there is no charity that is charity. [3] Because these three apostles had this signification they followed the Lord more than the others, as can be seen in Mark, where it is said: Jesus suffered no man to follow Him save Peter, James, and John the brother of James (5:37)."

Likewise He took Peter, James, and John up into the mountain when He was transfigured; He also spoke with these three about the consummation of the age, and about His coming; they were also with the Lord in Gethsemane. That the Lord called James and John after He had called Peter is shown in the Gospels: Jesus going on from thence saw other two brethren, James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and He called them. And straightway leaving the boat and their father, they followed Him (Matt. 4:21, 22; Mark 1:19, 20). [4] That the Lord gave a new name to James and John is evident in Mark: Jesus called James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James, and them He surnamed Boanerges, which is, sons of thunder (3:17). “Sons of thunder” signify truths from celestial good. This is the signification of “thunders” in the Word, because in the spiritual world thunders are also heard, and these are produced by truths that are from celestial good when these are descending from the higher heavens into the lower. The light itself of truth from good is then seen as lightning, the good itself is heard as thunder, and the truths themselves therefrom as variations of sound. This is why lightnings, thunders, and voices, are mentioned here and there in the Word with this signification. Good is there heard as thunder, because good, which is of man’s affection or love and is also of his will, is not spoken, but only sounds; while truth, which is of man’s understanding and of his thought therefrom, articulates that sound into words. Celestial good is the same thing as the good of love in will and in act; before this it is not celestial good; and celestial good is what produces truths by means of thought and speech therefrom. From this it is clear why James and John were called “sons of thunder.” (What “lightnings, thunders, and voices,” signify in the Word may be seen above, n. 273, 702, 704.)"

These were taken because only those who are in truths from celestial good are able to see the Lord in His glory; and no others can be enlightened and can perceive the Word in enlightenment. For when the Lord was transfigured before them He represented Divine truth, which is the Word; and this is why Moses and Elijah were seen speaking with Him, “Moses and Elijah” signifying the Word. (But on this see above, n. 594a). That the Lord talked with Peter, James, and John, about the consummation of the age and about His coming is evident in Mark (13:3); and that these three were with the Lord in Gethsemane is evident in Matthew (26:37) and in Mark (14:33). [6] As John represented the church in respect to good works, and good works contain all things of love to the Lord and of charity towards the neighbor, John was more loved by the Lord than the others, as is evident: From his reclining in the Lord’s bosom, and his gliding on His breast when he spake with Him (John 13:23, 25). The “bosom” and the “breast” signify in the Word spiritual love, which is love in act; and “the Lord’s bosom and breast” Divine love itself; therefore those in heaven who are in spiritual love are in the province of the breast. [7] So, too, John took the Lord’s mother to his own house, and abode with her; which is described thus in John: Jesus from the cross saw His mother and the disciple whom He loved standing by; He saith to His mother, Woman, behold thy son! Then He saith to the disciple, Behold thy mother! Therefore from that hour the disciple took her unto his own home (19:26, 27). This signified that the church is where there is charity in act, or where there are good works; for the Lord’s “mother” and “woman” signify the church, and “John” signifies charity in act, which is good works. (That “mother” signifies the church may be seen in the Arcana Coelestia, n. 289, 2691, 2717, 3703, 4257, 5581, 8897;"

[8] That the Lord’s church is in those who are in charity in act, or in good works, and not with those who are in faith separated from these, is signified also by what is related about Peter and John, namely: Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom the Lord loved following, which also leaned upon His breast at supper. Peter seeing him, saith to Jesus, Lord, but what about this one? Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? Follow thou Me (John 21:20–22). It may be seen above (n. 820b), where also the preceding words are explained, that “Peter” here signifies truth without good, or faith separated from good works, such as the faith will be at the end of the church; and as “John” signifies the goods of charity, which are called good works, and these are with those who constitute the Lord’s church; therefore it was not Peter but John who followed the Lord, and to Peter who had asked, “But what about this one?” the Lord replied, “If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? Follow thou Me,” which means that the good of charity will continue with those who are the Lord’s, even to the end of the church and when there is the new church, but not with those who are in faith separated from that good; and this is what is signified by these words to Peter, “what is that to thee?” 822. Whose stroke of death was healed, signifies and thus the discordance was cleared away by devised conjunctions of works with faith. This is evident from the signification of “the stroke of death was healed” with the first beast, as being the discordance apparently cleared away by devised conjunctions of works with faith (see above, n. 786, where the same words occur). It is said, the discordance cleared away by devised conjunctions of works with faith, but what the nature of the conjunctions devised by them is, namely, that they are rather separations, may be seen in the place cited above."

No one has known heretofore that all things of man’s life are in his works, since works seem to be mere movements, which are called actions because they are alive with man, and are called speech because they are effected by movements of the mouth, tongue, and larynx. And yet these are what make manifest the charity and faith in man, and also complete and perfect them; and this for the reason that neither faith nor charity is with man until they actually exist; and they actually exist in works. [3] All the things of charity and faith that are with man are in works, because works are the activities arising from his will and thought; and all things of the will and thought are brought forth and poured out into works, precisely as all things of cause into effects, and all things of a seed and tree into fruits; for works are their complements. That this is so is not apparent before man’s eyes, but is apparent perceptibly before the angels. When man is in the exercise of charity the sphere of all his affections and of the consequent thoughts is seen about him like clear water, and sometimes like a cloud, either bright white or obscure; and this sphere contains all things of his mind in their complex; and from it what is the quality of the man in respect to all things belonging to him is known to the angels. The reason is that everyone is his own love; and the works therefrom are what cause that love to be active, and when it is active it pours itself out round about him. This spiritual sphere manifests itself not only before the sight as an undulation, but also before the sight in various representative forms, and this to the extent that by those representatives the man, spirit, or angel, is seen precisely as he is. [4] Another reason why works contain in themselves all things of the mind is that all successive things, which advance in their order from highest to lowest, or from first things to last, form in things lowest or ultimate what is simultaneous, in which all things higher"

Moreover, works are the ultimate things of man springing from his interiors, which are in successive order. From all this it is clear that in these works all things of man’s will and thought, consequently all things of his love and faith coexist. This, then, is why works are so often commanded in the Word by the Lord, and why man must be judged according to his works. [5] From this it is clear what kind of man he is who separates faith from works, namely, that he has no faith, and that his works are evil, springing from the love of self and of the world, covered over and encompassed by such things as pertain to faith, but contaminated and profaned by the evils that are within. When, therefore, such a man is let into his interiors, as takes place after death when he becomes a spirit, all things belonging to his faith, which constituted the circumferences, are cast off and scattered. From this it can be seen why John, who represented the goods of charity or good works, reclined at the Lord’s breast, and that he and not Peter followed the Lord; also why he abode with the Lord’s mother after the Lord’s resurrection. 823. Verses 13, 14.

Verse 13. And he doeth great signs, signifies testifications and persuasions. This is evident from the signification of “signs” as being testifications and persuasions (see above, n. 706); and as “great” is predicated of good, and in the contrary sense of evil, therefore “great signs” signify testifications and persuasions of falsity from evil. It is here said that the beast “did great signs,” because “the beast” signifies confirmations from the Word in favor of faith separated from good works; and when reasonings from the natural man, which are signified by “the first beast,” are confirmed from the Word, they both testify and persuade that it is so, and this for the reason that those who make this separation are not willing that the intellectual sight should have any part in matters of faith, which they call mysteries; and when the intellectual sight is not present they can persuade anything they please, even that which from the mere light of nature, anyone may see to be false. Propose any falsity, and declare it to be true because it has been said by some leader who is believed by his followers to be enlightened or inspired, and take away the use of reason, and thus prevent the entrance of the understanding with any light, and you will see all things as true, and will be persuaded; and for the reason that the primary proposition is believed without first investigating whether it is a truth or a falsity.

But all this is ridiculous, because it is silly to conclude about a bird from any other color than its own, in which it appears; for thus all things in the world might be said to be white. [3] It is similar with the falsities of heresies, as with that greatest of all that existed in Babylon, of which it is said in Daniel that the king published an edict there that he should be wor shiped as God. It is similar with the reasonings, which are from hell, of those who declare that all things belong to nature, and even that nature created herself, and was not created by God; and if I may venture to say it, it is the same with the faith that is called justifying without an actual cooperation of the life. Such are the things here meant by “the great signs that the beast that came up out of the earth did, and made fire to come down from heaven unto the earth before men, and seduced them that dwell on the earth by reason of the signs that were given him to do before the beast,” as is said in this and the following verse. 825. So that he even maketh fire to come down from heaven unto the earth before men, signifies the love of falsity from evil, arising from the pride of self-intelligence, as if it were the love of truth from good, which is in the church from18 the heavens. This is evident from the signification of “fire,” as being love in both senses, namely, love to the Lord and love towards the neighbor; and in the contrary sense, the love of self and the love of the world (see above,"

Therefore those who are in the love of self and of the world are in the love of all the evils that arise therefrom, and in the love of the falsities from those evils. (On these loves and the evils and falsities arising therefrom, see the New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine, n. 65–83.) The above is evident also from the signification of making it, namely, the fire, “to come down from heaven,” which is said because this is done in the spiritual world, by means of arts there known, by those who are in faith separate; and it means that the appearance that the love of falsity from evil is the love of truth from good, is from the confirmation of faith separated from the life by means of the sense of the letter of the Word; since what is confirmed from the Word is confirmed from heaven; but when a falsity is confirmed from the Word it is not confirmed from heaven, but only appears to be confirmed from heaven. So also from the signification of “before men,” as being especially before those who are in the pride of self- intelligence, and who confirm in themselves this heretical dogma by their writings and preachings. From these it passes to the simple-minded, who have no pride of self-intelligence; but these do not confirm it with themselves, but suppose that it is so because it is declared and affirmed by a man of learning and consequent authority. But these merely hold the dogma in the memory, while the others implant it in their life, especially if they have lived according to it; and that which is implanted in the life inheres to eternity; but not what is merely in the memory. [2] The pride of self-intelligence is with all who confirm falsities even to the destruction of the Divine truth, in which the angels of heaven are; for those are in that pride who regard self only, that is, their reputation, in their writings and preachings. For such are in the love of self, and everyone who is in the love of self when he writes and preaches is in pride; and pride derives all things from man’s own (proprium), consequently it is called the pride of self- intelligence. The love of self has its seat in the will, and the pride of self-intelligence in the thought therefrom; consequently when they"

It is otherwise with those who are in the love of uses, and thence in the love of truth for the sake of truth. [3] Because those who are in the pride of self-intelligence remove works from faith, and therefore do not know what is meant by works, nor indeed what is meant by charity and by the neighbor, and even, when they have confirmed themselves, are not willing to know, it shall here be told what is meant by good works. Good works are all things that a man does, writes, preaches, and even speaks, not from self but from the Lord; and he acts, writes, preaches, and speaks from the Lord when he is living according to the laws of his religion. The laws of our religion are that one God is to be worshiped; that adulteries, thefts, murders, false witness, must be shunned; thus also frauds, unlawful gains, hatreds, revenge, lies, blasphemies, and many other things that are mentioned not alone in the Decalog but everywhere else in the Word, and are called sins against God and also abominations. When man shuns these because they are opposed to the Word, and thence opposed to God, and because they are from hell, then man lives according to the laws of his religion, and so far as he lives according to his religion is he led by the Lord; and so far as he is led by the Lord are his works good; for he is then led to do goods and to speak truths for the sake of goods and for the sake of truths, and not for the sake of self and the world; uses are his enjoyments, and truths his delights. Moreover, he is daily taught by the Lord what he must do and what he must say, also what he must preach or what he must write; for when evils are removed he is continually under the Lord’s guidance and in enlightenment. Yet he is not led and taught immediately by any dictate, or by any perceptible inspiration, but by an influx into his spiritual delight, from which he has perception according to the truths of which his understanding consists. When he acts from this influx, he appears to be acting as if from himself, and yet he acknowledges in heart that it is from the Lord. All angels are in such a state; and all infants in heaven are being led by that way to heaven."

They are like pictures composed of filthy mire, but overlaid with colors beautiful to the sight; or like harlots who appear comely in form, and adorned in white raiment, with diadems upon their foreheads and in their ears, and yet within are full of foulness. Consider, then, what the Christian world is at this day; how many there are who shun adulteries, frauds, unlawful gains, hatred, revenge, lies, and blasphemies, not because they are opposed to the Word and thus to God, but because they are opposed to the civil laws, and for the sake of reputation and from a fear of the loss of honor and gain in the world; then search interiorly into the reason, and you will perceive that it is because they do not believe that there is a heaven and a hell or a life after death. From this it is clear that whatever a man does, be it small or great, is a good work when it is done from religion, and in the church when it is done from the Word, when the man has come to detest evils because they are sins, and in themselves are infernal; on the other hand, that whatever a man does, be it small or great, is an evil work when it is not done from religion, and with us, from the Word. (For more about this see above, n. 803.) [5] It must be known, however, that he who shuns evils because they are opposed to the Divine laws in the Word also shuns them because they are opposed to civil and moral laws in the world, for a man thinks from civil and moral laws when he is in a natural state, but from the Divine laws when he is in a spiritual state. From this it follows, that to shun evils and do goods for the sake of reputation and one’s own honor is not hurtful, provided the Word and religion therefrom hold the higher place and constitute the head, and self and the world hold the lower place and constitute the feet. But otherwise religion is trampled down with the feet, and the world is worshiped with the head. 826. Verse 14.

Also from the signification of “them that dwell on the earth,” as being those who are of the church (see above, n. 821a). Also from the signification of “signs,” as being testifications and consequent persuasions (see just above, n. 824), here testifications from the sense of the letter of the Word.

Here “the signs that were done by this beast before the other” signify testifications from the sense of the letter of the Word, joined to reasonings from the natural man, because “the beast” that did the signs signifies confirmations from the sense of the letter of the Word; and “the beast” before which the signs were done signifies reasonings from the natural man; so here it signifies the conjunction of confirmations from the Word with these reasonings; and when these are conjoined they become testifications and persuasions. For reasonings that are from the natural man are of no avail in spiritual things before the world; but when the same reasonings are confirmed from the Word they prevail; for the reason that the Word is Divine, and in the sense of the letter consists of appearances of truth and of correspondences, in which the genuine truths that lie hidden within can be seen only by one who is enlightened; while one not enlightened can draw over these appearances of truth to confirm that falsities are truths, for with one who is not enlightened fallacies prevail, and the reasonings are from fallacies. But one who is enlightened sees from spiritual and from natural light at the same time; and the natural light with him is illumined by the spiritual; but one who is not enlightened sees from natural light only, separated from spiritual light, and such a light is in spiritual things not light but thick darkness. And yet this thick darkness, when falsities have been confirmed, appears to be as it were the light of truth, but it is like the light in the hells, which in the sight of those who are there appears as light; but as soon as light from heaven enters the light there is turned into mere thick darkness, and their thought grows dull.

Such is the light of the confirmation of falsity from the sense of the letter of the Word by reasonings from the fallacies of the natural man. From this it is clear that the light of the confirmation of falsity even to the destruction of the Divine truth which is in heaven, is infernal light. [2] As the preceding articles treat of good works, I will here go on with the plan and show what is meant by love to the Lord. All who are in love to the Lord from the Lord are in the third or inmost heaven; and they are such as have truths written in the life, and not, like the angels of the lower heavens, in the memory; and this is why those who are in the third heaven never talk about truths, but only listen to others speaking about them, and reply either that it is so, or that it is somewhat so, or that it is not so. For they see in themselves whether what they hear is true or not; and this they see not from any sight in the thought, as others do, but from the affection of truth in the understanding. For with them all truths are written on their affections, and these derive their essence from celestial love, which is love to the Lord. Thus with them truths make one with their affections. And as these angels are in love to the Lord from the Lord, their interior life consists of mere affections of good and truth from that love. For this reason they do not speak about truths, but do truths, that is, good works. For the affections of good and truth that are from that love must needs come forth in act, and when they come forth they are called uses, and are what are meant by good works. Moreover, they perceive in themselves the quality of the uses or works from the affection from which they are; and also the differences between them from the conjunction of many affections; thus they do all things with interior wisdom. And because they do not think about truths and thence speak about them, but only do them, and because this comes from their love to the Lord, and thence from the affections alone, of which their life consists, it is evident that love to the Lord consists in doing truths from the affection of them, and that their deeds are good works; consequently that to love the Lord is to do; and this is what is meant by the Lord’s words in John:"

Neither shall they teach a man his companion or a man his brother, Know ye Jehovah, for all shall know Me, from the least of them to the greatest of them (31:33, 34). “The law” means all things of the Word, thus all the truths and goods of heaven; “in the midst of them” signifies in their life; and the “heart” upon which the law shall be written signifies the love. From this it is clear how ample is the doctrine of love to the Lord, for it is the doctrine of all affections which belong to love; and every affection has truths written upon it according to the quality of its perfection, and brings them forth in act with infinite variety; and these affections do not come into the understanding in the form of ideas, but come to the inner sensitive perception in the form of delights of the will, wherefore they cannot be described by words.

So here “saying to them that dwell upon the earth that they should make an image to the beast” signifies an established decree that all in the church should teach and believe nothing whatever except these things. With those who belonged to the ancient churches images were made representative of their doctrine and the worship therefrom; but the sons of Israel, on account of the proclivity of their mind to idolatrous worship, were forbidden to make them, as is evident from the Word. [2] That it may be known that images have this signification I will cite in confirmation the following passages from the Word. In Moses: Thou shalt not make to thee any graven image, or any image of that which is in the heavens above or that is in the earth beneath or that is in the waters under the earth; thou shalt not bow thyself down to them nor worship them (Exod. 20:4, 5). Ye shall make no idols to you, neither shall ye rear you up a graven image or a pillar, neither shall ye place the stone of an image in your land to bow yourselves down to it (Lev. 26:1). Lest ye make to you a graven image, the image of any likeness, the figure of male or female, the figure of any beast that is on the earth, the figure of any winged bird that flieth under heaven, the figure of anything that creepeth on the ground, the figure of any fish that is in the waters under the earth (Deut. 4:16–18). The sons of Israel were forbidden to make idols, graven images, and forms or figures of anything in the heavens, on the earth, or in the waters, because the ancient churches which were before the Israelitish Church were representative churches, also because the sons of Jacob were wholly external men, and external men at that time, when all worship was representative, were prone to idolatries, thus to the worship of such things as appeared before their eyes. But as the ancient churches were representative churches, the men of those churches made to themselves graven images and forms of various things which represented and thence signified things heavenly; and the ancients took delight in these on account of their"

This is why they had groves and high places, and also sculptured, molten, and painted figures, which were set up either in groves or upon mountains, or in temples, or in their houses. So in Egypt, where the science of representations, which is the same as the science of correspondences, flourished, there were images, idols, and graven images, as also hieroglyphics; and other nations had the like. But when the men of those churches from being internal became external, then the celestial and spiritual things which were represented and thence signified remained as traditions with their priests and wise men, who were called magi and diviners; consequently the common people, because of the religious principle which their fathers saw in these things, began to worship them and to call them their gods. Now as the sons of Jacob were more external men than the others, and thence more prone to idolatries and also to magic, they were strictly forbid den to make to themselves graven images, images and figures of the likeness of anything existing in the heavens, on the earth, or in the sea, because all things that are in the world are representative, as flying things, beasts, fishes, and creeping things, for so far as they worshiped these idolatrously, so far they did not acknowledge Jehovah. And yet, since the church was representative with them also, the tabernacle was built, in which were placed the chief representatives of heavenly things, as the table on which were the loaves, the golden altar on which incense was offered, the lampstand with the lamps, the ark with the mercy seat, and the cherubim above it, and the altar not far from the door of the tabernacle, on which was the sacred fire; and afterwards the temple was built, in which also all things were representative, as the painting therein, the lavers outside of it, the brazen sea under which were the oxen supporting it, likewise the pillars and porticos, with the vessels of gold, all of which they were permitted to worship as holy, provided they acknowledged the tabernacle, and afterwards the temple, as the dwelling place of Jehovah. This was granted them to prevent their turning aside to idolatry and magic, which then existed with various nations in Asia; as Egypt, Syria, Assyria, Babylon, Tyre and Sidon, Arabia, Ethiopia, Mesopotamia, and especially in and about the land of Canaan."

That such things existed with various nations in the countries of Asia is made evident by the gods of Laban the Syrian that Rachel the wife of Jacob carried off (Gen. 31:19, 20); by the calves and other idols in Egypt; by the hieroglyphics there engraved and painted in temples, and upon obelisks and walls; by Dagon the idol of the Philistines in Ekron; by the idols made by Solomon, and afterwards by the kings in the temple of Jerusalem and in Samaria; and by the altars, pillars, images, and groves, among the nations of the land, which the sons of Israel were commanded to destroy, as is evident from various passages in the Word. 827b. [4] Moreover, it was from the knowledge of correspondences and representations: That the priests and diviners of the Philistines persuaded them to make golden images of the emerods and mice that had laid waste the land, and to place them beside the ark, which they sent back upon a new cart drawn by kine, and that they should thus give glory to the God of Israel (1 Sam. 6 seq.). For at that time their priests and diviners knew what all these things represented; and that the images of the emerods and mice signified the falsities of their religion, which might be atoned for by these as gifts made of gold. [5] Doctrinals are also signified by “images” in the following passages. In Ezekiel: They shall cast their silver into the streets, and their gold shall be an abomination, in that they have turned the gracefulness of their adornment into pride, and have made thereof images of their abominations and their detestable things; therefore I have made it unto them for an abomination (7:19, 20). This treats of the devastation of the church by falsities and evils, which is here meant by “the sword, pestilence, and famine” (verse 15), that were to consume them.

[6] In the same: Thou didst take the vessels of thy adornment, of my gold and of my silver which I had given to thee, and madest for thee the images of a male, with which thou couldst commit whoredom (Ezek. 16:17). This is said of “the abominations of Jerusalem,” which mean the adulterations of the truth and good of doctrine from the Word; “vessels of adornment of gold and silver” signifying the knowledges of good and truth from the Word; “to make of them images of a male” signifying to make doctrinals from falsities to appear as if from truths; and “to commit whoredom with them” signifying the falsification of them.

Love to the Lord, in which love are the angels that are in the third heaven, has been treated of above; it now remains to say something about the love towards the neighbor with those angels. By the “neighbor” they mean uses, which indeed19 are works; but with those angels uses are all things that are done with them from the Lord, and these have relation especially to the worship of the Lord, to His church, to the implantation of its holy things, especially with little children, with whom they have conjunction, and whom they inspire with innocence and its affections; also to the good of society in general and also in particular. These are the things that chiefly belong to their love, because they belong to the Lord’s love. The Lord operates these things with them by means of the love that is implanted in their life, which is such that they perceive in these things the delight of their life. Such things are the neighbor to them, because they do not regard persons, but such things as are with persons; for they have more wisdom than other angels, and it is wisdom to regard others from such things as are with them and which constitute them. For every angel, spirit, and man is his love and his affection, thus his good and his truth therefrom; and as these are what constitute them, and as they are wise, they must needs regard others according to what constitutes them. This to them is the neighbor, or the brother and companion, which are often mentioned in the Word, “brother” meaning to them good, and “companion” truth. Thence it is clear what love towards the neighbor is in the third heaven."

These works are derivations and productions of the uses before mentioned, and are such things as proceed from their thought, therefore they can discourse about them. These works keep the life of their body in such a state that the life of their love can dwell in it and perform its uses. These angels, being such, do not know what is meant by charity, or what is meant by faith; but they have the love of good in place of charity, and the love of truth in place of faith. Moreover, they are continually in the love of good and truth because their life is the affection of good, in which and from which is the perception of truth. When, therefore, charity from which is faith, or faith which is from charity, is mentioned, they do not know what is meant. As the angels of the third heaven are such they appear before the angels of the lower heavens like infants, some like boys, and all of them, as it were simple; moreover, they go naked. They appear like infants and like boys because they are in innocence; and love to the Lord from the Lord is innocence; and this is also why infants and boys signify in the Word innocence and also love to the Lord. [3] They appear simple because they cannot talk about the holy things of heaven and the church; for with them these things are not in the memory, from which all speech comes, but in the life; and from that in the understanding, not as thought but as the affection of good in its form, which does not descend into speech; and if it were to descend it would not be spoken, but only sounded; and those who cannot speak about such things appear to themselves and others as if simple. A further reason is that they are in humility of heart, knowing that wisdom consists in perceiving that the things in which they are wise are scarcely anything in comparison with the things in which they are not wise. They go naked because “nakedness” means in the spiritual sense innocence, and because “garments” signify truths clothing good, and the truths that clothe are in the memory, and from that in the thought; while with them truths are in the life, that is, are hidden, and manifest themselves"

Which hath the stroke of the sword and did live, signifies the nature of those natural things by which the things taken from the natural sense of the Word for confirmation were conjoined. This is evident from the explanation of what is said above in the third verse of the chapter, where are these words, “I saw one of his heads as if it had been wounded unto death, and the stroke of his death was healed,” for the explanation of which see above (n. 785, 786). That “sword” signifies the combat of falsity against truth and the destruction of truth by falsities see also above (n. 131, 367). 830. Verse 15. And it was given unto him to give breath to the image of the beast that the image of the beast may both speak and may cause that as many as do not worship the image of the beast be killed. 15. “And it was given unto him to give breath to the image of the beast,” signifies that by being conjoined with the Word there was something of spiritual life therein (n. 831); “that the image of the beast may both speak,” signifies that consequently an agreement flowed in from heaven into the thought nearest to the speech excited and enkindled by natural love (n. 832); “and may cause that as many as do not worship the image of the beast be killed,” signifies threats of eternal death to those that do not believe everything and all things that are so established (n. 833)."

And it was given unto him to give breath to the image of the beast, signifies that by being conjoined with the Word there was something of spiritual life therein. This is evident from the signification of “breath,” as being spiritual life (of which presently); also from the signification of “the image of the beast,” as being the doctrine of faith separated from good works, which would be taught and believed in the church (see above, n. 827a); from which it follows that “to give breath to the image of the beast” signifies that by a conjunction of the reasonings from the natural man with the Word there was something of spiritual life therein; but what the quality of that life is will be told presently; “breath” (spiritum) signifies spiritual life, because “breath” signifies in the highest sense Divine truth proceeding from the Lord, and thence, as applied to men, who receive it, it signifies spiritual life (see above, n. 183). Spiritual life is the same as a life from Divine truths; and as the Word is Divine truth, and thus from it man has spiritual life, therefore when reasonings from the natural man in favor of faith separated from life are conjoined with the Word, and thus it is made the doctrine for the church, there is in it something of spiritual life. For all things in the Word are in themselves spiritual, and give spiritual life to those who study it in the measure of its reception in the heart. Therefore the Lord says: The words that I speak unto you are spirit and are life (John 6:63). [2] As celestial love in which are the angels of the third heaven has been treated of in what precedes, I will now say something about spiritual love, in which are the angels of the second heaven. Spiritual love is the love of truth, and in the highest sense the love of the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord; thus it is also love to the Lord, but in a lower degree than that in which the celestial angels are. The celestial angels are in love to the Lord from the reception of Divine good from Him, while the spiritual angels are in love to the Lord from the reception of Divine truth from Him. The difference is like that between love in the will and love in the understanding, or like that between a flame and its light. Moreover light with the angels of the third heaven is derived from what is flaming, while the light of the angels of the second heaven is derived from what is bright white (but for more respecting this see"

The life of the angels of the third heaven consists in the affections of good, and the life of the angels of the second heaven in the affections of truth. The difference is such that they are easily distinguished by their faces and by their speech. As spiritual love is love of truth, and spiritual angels in respect to their life are affections of truth, they speak about the holy things of heaven and the church, unlike the angels of the third heaven, who cannot speak about these things, as has been said above. And as the celestial angels are perfected in wisdom by hearing, there are intermediate angels, who are called celestial-spiritual angels, who preach and teach truths in their temples, which are called houses of God, and are of wood. [3] Spiritual angels, from the spiritual love that constitutes their life, are affections of truth, and not affections of good, because they are reformed and regenerated and become angels in a way different from that of celestial angels. For spiritual angels admit truths first into the memory, and from that into the understanding, which is thus formed by these truths; and then they are perfected so far as they are spiritually affected by Divine truths, that is, on account of them and for the sake of a life according to them. But celestial angels do not first admit truths into the memory, but immediately into the will, and through acts into the life; consequently they are not able to speak about Divine truths, but they simply will and do them; while spiritual angels speak about Divine truths, because with them they are inscribed on the memory; and thought speaks from the memory. [4] And yet spiritual angels admit no truth into the memory and from it into the understanding with themselves unless they see it; for the angels in that heaven see truths from the light of truth, thus by enlightenment from the Lord; for in the heavens truths are spiritual objects, and appear more clearly before the angels there than natural objects do before men in the world; consequently they know20 that faith is nothing else than the acknowledgment of truth because it is seen to be true; and they cannot at all comprehend how a faith in anything that is not seen or understood can exist in anyone, for in that case a man does not know whether it be true or"

These angels are perfected in understanding so far as they are in the love of truth for the sake of life and its genuine uses; and in the same measure truths are implanted in their life and they become affections of truth. For as truths derive all their essence and all their life from good, so the understanding derives all its essence and life from the will and its activity; for the understanding is the receptacle of truth, and the will the receptacle of good, and their activity fills and establishes them. Thence also the truths of which their understanding is formed, when they come to be of the will and thence of the action are called goods, but spiritual goods; and because they then come to be of their love they enter the life and form it. From this also it is clear that the life of every man is from his works, since in them the affection which is of the will, and the thought which is of the understanding, terminate and thus have existence; and unless they are terminated they perish. For the will has no existence unless it becomes active; and when there is no will the understanding perishes, and there remains merely the faculty to understand. [5] Because their love is the love of truth they acknowledge as the neighbor truth in act, which is called spiritual good, thus the good of the church, the good of the society in which they are, the good of the fellow citizens in the society, and thus also the moral good which is called integrity, and the civil good which is called justice. Therefore their love towards the neighbor consists in exercises, which are works. Moreover, all in the spiritual heaven love uses, and are intent on works, by which their thoughts are kept as it were at home, and withheld from idleness, which is, as it is called, the devil’s pillow. They know that only those who perceive delight in works can be kept in spiritual love; such are in their fixed affection; but others are in every affection and thus in none, for they wander wherever pleasures and cupidities carry them. Again, the angels of the second heaven, like the angels of the third heaven, dwell in distinct societies, but the societies of the third heaven are above those of the second, because celestial love flows into spiritual love; for spiritual love derives its essence from celestial love by influx mediate and immediate from the Lord."

For art there, especially that of architecture, is in its own art. From that heaven many arts in the world derive their laws and harmonies, from which come their forms of beauty. The silver that is found among those who dwell beneath these heavens is given by the Lord from that heaven, but the gold from the third heaven; for silver corresponds to spiritual good, which is in its essence truth; and gold corresponds to celestial good. The spiritual angels are clothed in garments of fine linen and silk, generally in shining garments. And as the spiritual heavens correspond to the eyes, there are paradisiacal scenes, as also in many places rainbow colored appearances and these also are of ineffable beauty. They know nothing there about the sense of the letter of the Word, but only about its spiritual sense, for they have the Word in that sense, which is read by everyone. In that heaven, justice, integrity, verity, chastity, and the other praiseworthy virtues of moral life reign. These heavens constitute the royalty of the Lord, while the higher heavens, where the celestial angels are, constitute the priesthood of the Lord; for His royalty is Divine truth, and His priesthood is Divine good. 832. That the image of the beast may speak, signifies that consequently an agreement flowed in from heaven into the thought nearest to the speech excited and enkindled by natural love. This is evident from the speech and preaching of those who confirm the separation of faith from life by means of the Word. For all things of the Word and every particular of it communicate with the heavens, and from it there flows a holiness into the person speaking or preaching; but with such this holiness cannot flow into any spiritual affection and thought therefrom, because all who are in a faith separated from the life are not spiritual but merely natural. Therefore this holy principle flows into their natural love, which excites and enkindles the thought nearest to the speech.

[2] The sense of the letter of the Word communicates with heaven, because each and every thing therein contains a spiritual sense; and the spiritual sense is perceived in the heavens when the natural sense, which is the sense of the letter, is understood by man. That this is so has been confirmed to me from the spiritual world by much experience. I have heard some recite words from the sense of the letter of the Word and have perceived that immediately they had communication with some society of heaven; for the spiritual sense which was in the words then recited from the sense of the letter penetrated to that society. Sometimes this communication is abused by evil spirits to acquire for themselves favor from the heavens. From this it is clear what is the quality of the Word in the sense of the letter; and as it is a means of communicating with heaven, a spiritual which is holy and which agrees with the natural, flows in therefrom into the natural love of the one speaking or preaching from the Word; and this love excites the thought nearest to his speech. It is said the thought nearest to the speech, because man has interior thought and exterior thought. He has interior thought when he is alone and thinks by himself, but he has exterior thought when he is with others and is speaking with them. Everyone knows that21 man can think in himself differently from the thought from which he speaks before men. This exterior thought is what is meant by the thought nearest to the speech. This thought is excited and enkindled by natural love, which is the love of glory, honor, or gain, with those who are in falsities, and who confirm them from the sense of the letter of the Word. This, then, is what is signified by “the breath given to the image of the beast, that the image of the beast may speak,” which signifies that in the doctrine of faith separated from life, when it is conjoined with the Word, there is something of spiritual life, and that in consequence an agreement flowed in from heaven into the thought nearest to the speech, excited and kindled by natural love.

All love becomes spiritual by means of truths from the Word in the measure in which man acknowledges them and sees them in his understanding and afterwards loves them, that is, does them from the will. Love becomes spiritual by means of truths from the Word in the measure in which man acknowledges them and sees them in the understanding, because there are two memories in man, and from these there are two kinds of thought both with the evil and the good, namely, an interior and an exterior. Every man thinks with himself from the interior memory when he is left to himself and is led by his love. This thought is the thought of his spirit. But man thinks from the exterior memory when he is speaking before the world. Everyone sees even by a little reflection that there are these two kinds of thought. The things that a man thinks with himself from the interior memory when left alone to himself, belong to his life, and come to be of his life; for it is his spirit that then thinks, or what is the same, it is the affection proper to his life that excites this thought. But the things that a man thinks from the exterior memory, when they do not make one with the thought of the interior memory, do not belong to his life and do not come to be of his life, for they belong to the body for the sake of the world; and these things also after death, when a man becomes a spirit, are cast away. From this it can be seen what the state is of those who are evil, and who fear neither God nor man, namely, that inwardly with themselves they think evils and falsities, while outwardly they think and speak truths and also do goods; but when a man puts off the body and becomes a spirit these goods and truths are scattered, but the evils and the falsities thence remain with him as a spirit. But it is otherwise with the good. Because these have feared God and have loved the neighbor, when they think from the interior memory they think from truths that are from good; in like manner as when they think from the exterior memory. With them these two kinds of thought make one. And as they are in truths from good, the internal spiritual man, which is in conjunction with angels in the heavens, and is in itself an angel of heaven, is opened with them; and as this is in the light of heaven, in which spiritual truths appear as clearly as objects in the world appear before the eye, when it sees truths it receives them and forms the understanding from them.

Who cannot see that nothing can enter the life of a man and constitute it except what he has first thought to be so and afterwards has willed that it should be so? From this it can be seen that if a man’s love is to become spiritual he must see his truths, that is, must grasp them by the understanding. [4] But if you say that spiritual truths cannot be seen, and that the understanding cannot be so far opened so long as man is in the world, let it be known that he who loves truth from truth, that is, because it is truth, can see spiritual truths; and those which he does not see in the world he sees afterwards in heaven. For it is the love itself of truth that receives the light of heaven, which enlightens the understanding. Moreover, everyone can receive in thought and can understand truths more than he himself knows, unless his own love induces obscurity and causes darkness. This has often been proved to me in the spiritual world. For evil spirits have understood spiritual truths when they have been uttered by anyone just as well as good spirits, and even almost like angels; but as soon as they turned their ear away and let themselves back into the state of their own love they understood nothing at all. From this it is clear that every man has the ability to understand truths, and even to see them; but that nothing except a love of truth for the sake of truths causes a man to understand them, in the world rationally, but after death spiritually. [5] But love with man, and his life from it, do not become spiritual by merely knowing and understanding truths unless he also wills and does them. For, as has just been said, an evil man, whose love is infernal, can know and understand truths just as well as a good man whose love is heavenly; therefore the evil believe that because of their knowledges and their understanding of verities they will not only come into heaven but will also be among the intelligent there, of whom it is said that “they shall shine as the stars,” and yet, if they do not also love, that is, will to do the truths that they know and understand, they come after death among those who are in hell, from whom all truths are taken away.

[6] There are three degrees of life with man, the third degree in which are the angels of the third heaven; the second degree in which are the angels of the second heaven; and the first degree in which are the angels of the first or ultimate heaven. There is also a lowest degree, which is corporeal and material, which man has while he lives in the world. These degrees are opened with man according to the reception of Divine truth in his life; and Divine truth is received in the life by willing and doing truth according to the knowledge and understanding of it. And as the love and the life of man make one, it follows that there are as many degrees of love as there are of life. The love in which the angels of the third heaven are is called celestial love; the love in which the angels of the second heaven are is called spiritual love; and the love in which the angels of the first heaven are is called spiritual-natural love, also celestial- natural. As their love is, such is their wisdom and intelligence. Those who are in the third degree of love and of wisdom thence live in an atmosphere as it were purely ethereal; those who are in the second degree of love and thence of intelligence live in an atmosphere as it were purely aerial; and those who are in the first degree of love and thence of knowledge live in an atmosphere as it were purely aqueous. And as the purity of their life is in a similar degree as their love, it is evident that those who are in the third heaven and in the love and life of that heaven cannot be approached by those who are in the second and first; for to ascend from the second heaven into the third would be like a bird’s flying above its own atmosphere into the ether; and to ascend from the first heaven into the second would be like elevating a fish into the air, in which it would suffocate and suffer direful things.

And may cause that as many as do not worship the image of the beast be killed, signifies threats of eternal death to those who do not believe everything and all things that are so established. This is evident from the signification of “to worship,” as being to acknowledge and believe (see above, n. 790a, 805a, 821a); also from the signification of “ the image of the beast,” as being the doctrine of faith separate, and a decree that all things and each thing therein established should be taught and believed (see just above, n. 827a); also from the signification of “to be killed,” as being to be killed spiritually, that is, to perish in eternal death (see above, n. 315, 589). From this it is clear that “to cause that as many as do not worship the image of the beast be killed” signifies threats of eternal death to those who do not believe everything and all things that are so established. It is well known that this is so, for salvation, thus life eternal, is declared to all those who believe in that doctrine, and damnation and eternal death are denounced against those who do not believe. 834. As celestial love and spiritual love have been treated of, it now remains to say something about the spiritual-natural love in which are the angels of the first or ultimate heaven. This love is what is properly called charity towards the neighbor. As these angels are nearly alike in respect to the understanding as men in the world are, and as they are natural, their understanding is raised but little above what it was while they were in the world; therefore they do not see truths in the light as the angels of the second heaven do; but they receive, acknowledge, and believe truths from doctrine, in which they are instructed before they are admitted into heaven. For this reason only the more intelligent of them know what charity towards the neighbor is, the simple there believing that every man is the neighbor, and that charity is to assist the needy, and to do good to the poor, the sojourner, and so on. For the most part they consider persons and what they say, and not the interiors which are the source of what they say.

Nevertheless, those are there taught that “neighbor” does not mean in the Word a man merely in respect to person, but in respect to the quality in him that makes him to be such and such a man; also that the quality of a man is from his understanding and will, and the quality of his understanding is from truths, and the quality of his will is from goods, and the quality of both the understanding and the will is from his love. From this it is known that while every man is a neighbor, every man is a neighbor from his quality, and consequently that it is the quality of a man from which he is a man that is meant in the spiritual sense by “neighbor;” for otherwise a bad man would be as much a neighbor as a good man; and yet to do good to the evil is sometimes doing evil to the good. That this is so anyone can see from natural lumen. If you were to choose a helper or servant from those in your neighborhood, and ten were brought before your eyes from whom you were to choose one, would you choose from the face alone? Would you not choose from some quality that you love, as integrity, modesty, piety, uprightness? These you would consider as you looked upon them. It is similar in respect to the neighbor; it is the man’s quality that is to be loved. From this it follows that the neighbor in the spiritual sense is that with a man which makes him be such and such a man. 835. Verses 16, 17.

This is evident from the signification of “all, the small and the great,” as being the lower and the higher, or the more common and the more eminent; also from the signification of “the rich and the poor,” as being the wise and the simple. (That those are called “rich” who possess many knowledges of good and truth, thus who are wise, may be seen above, n. 118, 236; and that those are called “poor” who have no knowledges of good and truth because they do not have the Word, and yet they desire them, may also be seen above, n. 118, 238.) So also from the signification of “the free and the bond,” as being those who think from themselves and those who think from others. To think from oneself is to see from oneself whether a thing be true or false, and thus to choose the one and reject the other. These are they who are made spiritual by the Lord, and are thence in the light of heaven, and from the Lord they see and are led; for to think and live from the Lord is freedom; and to think and live from hell is bondage; that such are “the free” may be seen above (n. 248, 490a,b, 701a, 774); that the Lord makes them to be free by means of His Divine truth is declared in John (8:32–36). It may also be seen above (n. 820b) that the church when it is in faith from love is in a free state, but when it is in faith without love is in a servile state, and that this is what is meant by the Lord’s words in John (21:18). From this it follows that by “the bond” those are meant who think not from themselves but from others, and who do not see whether a thing is true or false and yet acknowledge it to be true. That such are “the bond,” while those who think from themselves are “the free,” is evident from the opposition of their relation. 837.

And in fact, his face gradually becomes the face of his affection or love, from which he is then known, as he is also known from his speech, the tone of which is the tone of his affection. In a word, a man after death becomes his love or his affection in form; and consequently when anyone speaks against the affection which is of his love, or assaults it, his face is changed, and he himself goes away or suddenly vanishes. As all men after death are the substances and forms of their love, therefore the whole heaven, which consists of angels who have been men, is divided into societies according to the genera and species of the affections, thus according to all the differences and varieties of the affections. And hell, also, which consists of spirits who have been men, is divided into societies according to the affections opposite to heavenly affections, and according to all the differences and varieties of these in general and in particular. That man after death is his love, or his affection which is of the love, has been heretofore unknown in the world; for the world has believed that affection does nothing and that thought does everything; and for the reason that man has not been able to reflect upon the affections and the variations of them in himself, but only upon thoughts and their variations; for thoughts he sees inwardly in himself as it were, but not affections; and what does not reach the sight of his thought, and thus become manifest, is not considered by him. But whoever is wise can know his affections by his thoughts; for the affections manifest themselves in the thoughts whenever a man is in the freedom of his spirit and is alone with himself; for he then thinks from the affection which belongs to his love. Nor is thought anything else than affection made visible in various forms by the influx of light; therefore if you take away affection the thought immediately perishes, just as light does if you take away the flame. From this it is clear how important it is to acquire for oneself heavenly love or affection. How this is acquired shall be told in what follows.

That this is so is clearly evident in the case of spirits and angels, who are all men both in face and in body; for as soon as the love of one of them is assaulted he vanishes with his whole body, even though he were sitting shut up in a room; and this I have frequently seen; and thus it was made clear that an angel or spirit is not only an affection in a human form, but also that his whole life from the head to the sole of the foot, or from cap to shoe, is nothing but affection which is of love; otherwise he could not have wholly vanished from the eyes of those sitting by him. When inquiry was made whether his corporeal form with its members is also affection which is of the love, it was found that each thing and all things of these were so; for the reason that the universal heaven, which, as has been said above, is divided and formed into societies according to all the differences and varieties of the affections, has a relation to one man, and from this all angels and spirits are human forms; therefore as heaven is a complex of all affections, so, too, is an angel and a spirit, who are least forms of heaven. This arcanum was thus made clear to me, and it was also confirmed from heaven, that all things and everything of man, both of his mind and of his body, are forms of love in a wonderful series, and that the organs of the brain and of the face, as also the members and viscera of the body, are perpetual contextures corresponding to those affections of heaven in which its societies are. And from this still another arcanum was made clear to me, namely, that the affections of the mind and the thoughts therefrom spread out and pour themselves forth into all things of the body, as into the field of their excursion and circumgyration, which field and circum gyration are from the affection of the mind and its thought into the uses from which, in which, and according to which, the members and viscera of the body are formed. For it is similar as with the affections and thoughts therefrom of the angels, in that they pour themselves forth in every direction into heaven and its societies; and according to their extension is the wisdom of"

(3) [3] Since love constitutes the life of man, and man is to live to eternity either in heaven or in hell in accordance with the life he has acquired in the world, it is a matter of the highest importance to know how man acquires heavenly love and becomes imbued with it, so that his life, which is to have no end, may be blessed and happy. (4) [4] There are two chief faculties of man’s life, namely, the will and the understanding. The will is the receptacle of all things of good, and the understanding is the receptacle of all things of truth from that good. Man cannot be reformed except by means of these two faculties of life, and only by their being filled by goods and truths. Reformation is effected in this order: first, man must fill the memory with knowledges and cognitions of truth and good, and by means of these he must acquire for himself the light of reason; especially be must learn that God is one, that the Lord is the God of heaven and earth, that there is a heaven and a hell, that there is a life after death, and that the Word is holy. (5) [5] Next he must learn what evils are sins, first from the Decalog, and afterwards from the Word everywhere, and must think that they are sins against God, and that they therefore withhold and separate man from heaven, and condemn and sentence him to hell. Consequently, the first thing of reformation is to refrain from sins, to shun them, and finally to be averse to them; but that he may refrain from them, shun them, and be averse to them he must pray to the Lord for help. But he must shun them and turn away from them because they are opposed to the Word, thus opposed to the Lord, and thence opposed to heaven, and because they are in themselves infernal."

(7) [7] Thus is man reformed by the Lord; and so far as he then knows and understands truths and wills and does them, so far he becomes a new man, that is, a regenerate man, and thus becomes an angel of heaven, and has a heavenly love and life. (8) [8] The love and life of such a one are wholly according to the works of his will; and the works of the will are according to the truths that are applied to the life. The knowledges of truth and good that a man has acquired for himself from infancy, and with which he has filled his memory, are not living in him until he begins to be affected by truths because they are truths, and begins to will and to do them. Until then they are only outside of the life of man. (9) [9] By good works are meant each and every thing that a man does after he has turned away from evils because they are sins against God; for then he no longer does good works or operates them from self but from the Lord. He then also learns daily what he is to do; and he has a clear discernment of goods and evils, and shuns evils and does good with prudence, intelligence, and wisdom. Thus much respecting the love, which constitutes the life of man. Something shall now be said respecting faith. (10) [10] The ancients did not know what faith is; but in place of faith they had truth; for when truth is perceived or is seen in the understanding, and thus acknowledged, it is believed on its own account; consequently it cannot be said of it that faith must be had in it, since faith is in it. If, for example, one sees a tree and a flower in a garden, and another should say that he should believe or have faith that there is a tree and a flower there, and that it is such a tree and such a flower, would he not answer, Why do you wish me to believe or to have faith in this when I myself see it?

They wonder and laugh when they hear anyone saying that the understanding is to be held captive under obedience to faith, and that one should have faith in what is not perceived and seen; and they say that in this way what is false may be believed, and by confirmations be placed as if in light, and truth itself as if in darkness; and thus falsity may play with truth as with a ball. (11) [11] When the world could no longer see truths from the love of them and from their light, because men had become natural and external, then faith began to be mentioned, and everything of faith began to be called truth, although it was not perceived or seen but only asserted by some leader and confirmed by passages of the Word not understood. This is the condition of the churches in the Christian world at this day, in every one of which the doctrinals of their faith are believed to be truths, and this for the sole reason that these are held by the church of their native land; and yet that it is not perceived or seen whether they are true is clear from the discussions, disput ings, opinions, and heresies respecting them, in general and in particular, both public and private. (12) [12] So long as faith was joined with works, and charity was acknowledged in an equal degree with faith, or above it, the church was in truths from the Word, but only in a few, because they did not see them. But as soon as faith was separated from charity the church fell from truths into falsities, and at length into a faith that has destroyed all the truths of the church. This faith is a faith in justification and salvation by the merit of the Lord with the Father. For if man is saved by this faith alone, and this faith also is separated from the goods of life, which are good works, what need is there of truths, which teach the way to heaven and lead to it? Live and believe in any way you wish, and merely hold that faith, and you will be saved. But let me tell you, my reader, that all who live that faith are in natural love separated from spiritual love; and natural love separated from spiritual love is the love of self and the"

(13) [13] The reason for this is that there is no truth with man, still less any faith, unless he wills it and does it, for until then it is not a truth of the life, but only a truth of the memory, which is outside of man and not within him; and what is outside of him is dispersed. From this it is clear that faith without works is not faith—unless it be a faith in falsity from evil, which is a dead faith, such as reigns in hell. 838. That there be given them a mark upon their right hand and upon their foreheads, signifies an attestation of the acknowledgment that they are of the church, and are in the so-called truths and goods of that faith. This is evident from the signification of a “mark,” as being a sign or attestation of acknowledgment, here that they are of that church; also from the signification of “right hand,” as being the truth of faith in its power (see above, n. 298); also from the signification of “forehead,” as being the good of love (see also above, n. 427). So here “the right hand and the forehead” signify the so-called truths and goods of that faith, which, nevertheless, are either not truths and goods or are falsities and evils. The acknowledgment of these as truths and goods however is signified by “giving and receiving a mark upon their right hand and upon their foreheads.” A “mark” signifies a sign of acknowledgment also in the following passages in Revelation, 14:9, 11; 15:2; 16:2; 19:20; 20:4. Moreover, a “mark” has a similar meaning as: The sign set by Jehovah upon Cain (Gen. 4:15); Likewise the sign that the prophet was commanded to set upon tho foreheads of the men in the city of Jerusalem (Ezek. 9:4); as also the “sign” in Moses:"

It has been shown already that every man is his love, and that the love and life of man make one and are one. It shall now be shown that a man’s faith is such as his love or life is, also that a man’s faith is according to his works. It has been shown above that works contain in themselves all things of man’s love and life, since works are their products and effects, and are the ultimates in which all things prior coexist. For this reason angels of the third heaven know what the quality of a man is by the tone of his speech, also by his step, by the touch of the hand, by the action of the body, by his exultation, and by many other things, which are acts. That a man is known in the third heaven by such things is not known in the world, because man believes that there is nothing in such things but mere motion; when yet the life of his mind produces these actions by means of the life of his body; and both of these lives, with everything pertaining to them, concur in the production of these acts, from which it follows that they manifest themselves in them. Since, then, a man’s life goes forth into works, and manifests itself in them, it follows that his faith does the same; for faith is the acknowledgment that a thing is so, and acknowledgment is of the thought and at the same time of the will; and as will and thought produce action by means of the life of the body, so also faith is manifested in works as to its quality. And yet nothing is acknowledged to be so in thought, will, and work together, except what pertains to man’s love and life, for it is his love and life that acknowledge; which shows that as faith is such as man’s love and life are, so it is such as his works are. [2] By works all things are meant that a man does, speaks, and writes, whether great and many or little and few; as whatever an officer does in his office, or whatever a priest does in his, or a merchant in his, or a servant in his; all such works, whether little or great, are good when they are done from the Lord with man, and are evil when they are done by the man himself; thus they are good so far as man shuns evils because they are sins against God, and they are evil so far as he does not shun evils.

Man supposes that even if he lives wickedly he can still have faith, at least to believe that there is a God, that the Lord is the Savior of the world, that there is a heaven and a hell, and that the Word is holy. But I can affirm that if he does not shun evils because they are sins, and then look to the Lord, he does not at all believe these things; since they are not of his life and love, but only of his memory and knowledge; and they do not come to be of his life and love until he fights against evils and overcomes them. This has been made clear to me by the state of many after death who supposed that they had believed at least that there is a God, and that the Lord is the Savior of the world, and other like things; and yet such as had lived wickedly had not believed. 840. Verse 17. And that no one be able to buy or22 to sell if he hath not the mark of the beast, signifies forbidding anyone to learn and teach anything but what has been acknowledged and thence accepted in doctrine. This is evident from the signification of “to buy and to sell,” as being to acquire knowledges to oneself and to communicate them to others, thus to learn and to teach (of which presently). “To cause no one to be able” signifies to forbid. It is evident also from the signification of a “mark,” as being an attestation and sign of acknowledgment that those who are in these so-called truths and goods of that faith are of the church (see just above, n. 838). From this it is clear that “to cause that no one be able to buy and to sell save he that hath the mark of the beast” signifies forbidding anyone to learn and to teach anything but what has been acknowledged and also accepted in doctrine. “To buy and to sell” signifies to acquire for oneself the knowledges of truth and good from the Word and to communicate them, or what is the same, to learn and teach, because “wealth and riches” signify in the Word the knowledges of truth and good; and “silver and gold,” by means of which buying and selling are conducted, signify the truths and goods of heaven and the church; and this is why “buying and selling,” and also “doing business and trading,” are spoken of in the Word here and there, and why they signify spiritual buying and selling, and doing business and trading."

Everyone sees that by “buying wine and milk” is not here meant buying such things. And as “to buy” signifies to acquire for oneself such things as contribute to man’s spiritual life, evidently the particulars here are to be spiritually understood; thus the “waters” to which everyone that thirsts may come signify truths for those that desire them; “waters,” meaning truths from the Word, and “to thirst” meaning to desire them; that these are given freely from the Lord is signified by “he that hath no silver,” also by “without silver and without price;” “to eat” signifies to appropriate to oneself; “wine and milk” signify spiritual truth and natural truth therefrom, both from good. [3] In Matthew: The prudent virgins said to the foolish, Go ye rather to them that sell, and buy oil for yourselves; but while they went away to them to buy the bridegroom came (25:9, 10). “The prudent virgins” signify those in the church with whom faith is conjoined to charity, and “the foolish” signify those in the church with whom faith is separated from charity; for “lamps” signify the truths of faith, and “oil” signifies the good of love; therefore “to go to them that sell and to buy” signifies to those who teach, and to learn or acquire for oneself. But as such had not acquired for themselves the good of love, and vivified by that means the truths of faith, while they lived in the world, but had acquired them afterwards, and as no one can acquire for himself the good of love after death and retain it, so these foolish virgins, by whom all who separate the good of love or the good of charity from the truths of faith are signified, were not admitted to the marriage feast nor received by the bridegroom. “The marriage feast” signifies heaven, and “the bridegroom” the Lord.

[7] As “Tyre” signifies the church in respect to the knowledges of truth and good, and thence also the knowledges of truth and good which belong to the church, and which are serviceable for its doctrine, so where “Tyre” is treated of in the Word, her “tradings” are also treated of, which signify the acquisition and also the communication to others of these knowledges, as in Ezekiel: All the ships were for the trading of thy traffic; Tarshish was thy trader in silver, iron, tin, and lead; they traded for thy merchandise. Javan, Tubal, and Meshech, these were thy merchants; they traded for the merchandise with the soul of man and with vessels of brass. The sons of Dedan were thy merchants, many islands were the merchants of thy hand. Syria was thy trader with chrysoprasus.

Everyone can see that tradings and merchandise here do not mean tradings and merchandise; for what has the Word, which in itself is Divine and heavenly, and teaches man about God, heaven and the church, eternal life, and the like, in common with such things? Therefore who cannot see that all the particulars here signify spiritual things which pertain to heaven and the church, not only the names of the lands here mentioned with which trading was carried on, but also their special kinds of merchandise?

This treats of the prince of Tyre, by whom the knowledges of truth from the Word, through which come intelligence and wisdom, are meant; and as these same knowledges are signified by “wealth,” and the acquisition of them by “trading,” it is said, “by the abundance23 of thy wisdom in thy trading thou hast multiplied to thyself wealth.” [9] From all this it can now be seen why: The Lord compared the kingdom of the heavens to a merchant seeking beautiful pearls, who, when he had found one of great price, went and sold all that he had and bought it (Matt. 13:45, 46). “Pearls” signify knowledges, and also truths themselves; and “the one of great price” signifies the acknowledgment of the Lord; and “to sell all that he had” signifies to set aside all things that are of one’s own love, and “to buy it” signifies to procure for oneself that Divine truth.

So the church in which such things exist is called: A land of trading (Ezek. 16:29; 21:30, 31; 29:14). Moreover, “to sell” and “to be sold” signify to alienate truths and to be alienated from them, and to accept falsities in their place, and to be captivated by them (Isa. 50:1; 52:3; Ezek. 30:12; Joel 3:6, 7; Nahum 3:4; Zech. 13:5; Ps. 44:11–13; Deut. 32:30).

So now “the number of the name” signifies the quality of truth from good, that is, the quality of faith from love; but because the beast is here treated of it must here be understood in the contrary sense. 842. As faith and works have been treated of above I will draw from these the following conclusion: that love, life, and works make one in every man, so that whether you say love, or life, or works, it is the same. It has been shown above that love constitutes the life of a man, and that his life is such as his love is, not only the life of the mind, but at the same time the life of the body. And since that which a man loves he also wills with the mind and does with the body, it follows that love and deeds or works make one. There are many things to show that works proceed from both the internal and the external life of man, and that they are the activities of the sphere of the affections and of the thoughts therefrom by which he is encompassed, and that no communication of man’s life and love is possible unless the encompassing sphere, which is of his life, becomes active by doing; consequently such as the life is, or such as the love is, or such as the works are, with man, such are all the things of which that sphere is composed, and in consequence such also is the faith. So if the works are evil it follows that there is no faith of truth, but only a faith of falsity; for evil and falsity cling together, but not evil and truth. But if the works are good it follows that there is a faith of truth, for good and truth mutually love each other, and join themselves together. But if a man’s works appear"

Verse 18. Here is wisdom, signifies that this is their doctrine in all its complex, which is thought to be wisdom, although it is insanity. This is evident from the signification of “here is wisdom,” as being that all those things that have been said of the dragon and his two beasts is the doctrine of those who have separated faith from life, which however is not wisdom, as it is reputed, but insanity. That this is the meaning of “here is wisdom” follows from what precedes, that “no one is able to buy24 and sell save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name,” which signifies that no one should learn or teach anything else but what had been acknowledged, and thus accepted in doctrine. From this it can be concluded that “wisdom” here means wisdom in their own eyes; which, nevertheless, is insanity appearing to them to be wisdom.

And this is why their insanity when they are in falsities is called in the Word “wisdom and intelligence,” as in the following passages: O Lord God, Thou hast hid these things from the wise and intelligent, and hast revealed them unto babes (Matt. 11:25; Luke 10:21). Woe to the wise in their own eyes, and the intelligent before their own faces (Isa. 5:21). I will visit upon the fruit of the proud heart of the king of Assyria and upon the splendor of the exaltation of his eyes; for he hath said, In the power of my hand I have done it, and by my wisdom; because I was intelligent (Isa. 10:12, 13). Surely the princes of Zoan are fools, the wise of the counselors of Pharaoh; how say ye unto Pharaoh, I am the son of the wise (Isa. 19:11). The wisdom of his wise men shall perish, and the intelligence of his intelligent shall hide itself (Isa. 29:14). He casteth the wise men backward (Isa. 44:25). A sword against the inhabitants of Babylon, and against her princes, and against her wise ones (Jer. 50:35). This is why the magi in Babylon and elsewhere were called wise men (Dan. 2:48). From this it is clear that wisdom is predicated in the Word also of those who are not wise, also of those who are insane from falsities, like as “diadems” are attributed to them (as to the dragon, Rev. 12:3, and to his beast in the first verse of this chapter); and it is said of the woman who sat on the scarlet beast: That she was arrayed in purple and scarlet, gilded with gold, adorned with precious stones and pearls (Rev. 17:4)."

He that hath intelligence let him count the number of the beast, signifies that those who are in enlightenment may inquire into the quality of the faith of that religion. This is evident from the signification of “having intelligence,” as meaning to be in enlightenment (of which presently); also from the signification of “to count,” as being to inquire into. “To count” signifies to inquire into because in the two senses of the Word, namely, in the literal sense and in the spiritual sense, words are used in agreement with their subjects; that is, “to count” is predicated of number, and to inquire into is predicated of the quality of faith. Also from the signification of “the number of the beast” as being the quality of the faith of this religion. That “number” signifies the quality of faith, may be seen above (n. 841), also that “the beast” signifies faith separated from life, which is the faith of that religious principle. From this it is clear that “he that hath intelligence let him count the number of the beast” signifies that those who are in enlightenment may inquire into the quality of the faith of that religion. Those who are in enlightenment are to make the inquiry because the quality of the faith of that religion can be seen and thus can be inquired into by no others. For everything of the Word by which inquiry must be made and from which there can be judgment is in the light of heaven, and therefore can be seen only from that light, and it is that light which enlightens man; therefore to inquire into the quality of the faith of any religion which has been confirmed by some passages of the Word can be done only by one who is in the light of heaven, consequently who is in enlightenment. 846.

[2] Moreover, those who are in faith separated from charity shut out the understanding, demanding obedience to a faith not understood, and that the faith understood is man’s own faith, and thus is natural and not spiritual. But what the quality of intellectual faith is shall be told. The Word in its spiritual sense treats in many passages of the understanding of the Divine truth in the Word; and where it describes the desolation of the church it treats also of the destruction of the understanding of its Divine truths from the Word; and from a collection of passages on that subject, carefully investigated in respect to their interior meaning, it is clear that so far as the understanding of truth perishes in the church, so far the church perishes. Moreover, the understanding of the Word is signified in many passages by “Egypt,” “Assyria,” “Israel,” and also “Ephraim”; “Egypt” signifying the natural understanding of it, “Assyria” the rational understanding; “Israel” the spiritual understanding, and “Ephraim” the understanding itself of the Word in the church. But in order that man may see and perceive from enlightenment the genuine truths of the Word, these three degrees of understanding, the natural, the rational, and the spiritual, must be together; for the natural understanding, which is the lowest, cannot be enlightened by its own lumen, but must be enlightened by the light of the rational man, which is intermediate, and this by spiritual light; for the spiritual understanding is in the light of heaven and sees by it, and the rational is intermediate between the spiritual and the natural, and receives spiritual light and transmits it to the natural and enlightens it. This shows that the natural understanding without light through the rational from the spiritual is no understanding, for it is without light from heaven; and the truths of the church, which are also truths of heaven, can by no means be seen except in the light of heaven; the reason is that Divine truth proceeding from the Lord as a sun is the light of heaven, and the Lord enlightens man by His own light only, which is spiritual light."

For man, from natural light separated from spiritual light, views the things of the church from self and not from the Lord, and consequently he can see them only from appearances and fallacies; and to see them from these is to see falsities for truths, and evils for goods. The fire that propagates and enkindles that light is the love of self and the consequent pride of self-intelligence. Man who thinks from that fire and that light so far as he excels in genius and thence in the ability to confirm whatever he pleases, so far he is able to so confirm falsities and evils as to make them appear to be truths and goods, and can even set forth falsities and evils in a resplendent natural light, which is, nevertheless, a delusive light that has been thus exalted by art. But to apprehend church matters by this light is not to understand them, but rather to not understand them, since by that light alone man sees truths as falsities, and falsities as truths. This is especially so when any accepted dogma is assumed to be the truth itself, with no previous investigation whether it be true or not; or if investigated is investigated only through what has been established by reasonings from the natural man, and by confirmations from the Word not understood. When a man views all the dogmas of his religion in this way he can assume as a principle whatever he pleases, and can so impart to it the light of confirmation as to make it to appear to be a truth from heaven, although it is a falsity from hell. [4] From this it can be concluded that the understanding of the truths of the church means the understanding of them that is enlightened by the light of heaven, thus by the Lord. The man who is in that enlightenment is able to see the truths of the church rationally in this world, and spiritually after death. But to enter into church matters, which are interiorly spiritual and celestial, from natural lumen separated from spiritual light, which is the light of heaven from the Lord, is to proceed by an inverse order, since what is natural cannot enter into what is spiritual, but what is spiritual can enter into what is natural.

This is evident from the signification of “number,” as being the quality of faith separated from the life; also from the signification of “six hundred sixty-six” as being all falsities and all evils therefrom in the complex. This is the signification of that number, because “six” signifies all things, and is predicated of truths and of goods therefrom, and in the contrary sense of falsities and of evils therefrom; for that number is composed of the numbers two and three multiplied together, and the number two is predicated of goods, and in the contrary sense of evils; and the number three of truths, and in the contrary sense of falsities; and a composite number has a similar signification as the simple numbers of which it is composed. This, then, is why “six” signifies all truths and all goods therefrom in the complex, and in the contrary sense all falsities and all evils therefrom in the complex. That all these may be signi fied to the full, that number is tripled; and by triplication the number 666 arises. For a thing triplicated signifies completeness and fullness from beginning to end; so here it signifies that nothing whatever of truth and good remains.

From this it is clear that the number “six hundred sixty-six,” which is said to be “the number of a man,” and “to count” which is said to be a matter of intelligence, signifies the quality of faith separated from good works, that it is composed of all falsities and of all evils therefrom in the complex. Its being said to be a matter of intelligence to count that number does not signify that it is a matter of intelligence to know or find out the signification of that number, but that it is a matter of intelligence to inquire into and see the falsities and evils that make up the quality of faith separated from life. [3] That the quality of that faith is such in respect to falsities will be seen in what presently follows. It is also such in respect to evils because when good works are set aside (and they are set aside when it is believed that they contribute nothing at all to justification or salvation), it follows that evil works take their place; for a man must be either in goods or in evils. That he cannot be in both together is meant by these words of the Lord: No one can serve two masters; he will either hate the one and love the other.... Ye cannot serve God and mammon (Matt. 6:24). Therefore all evils in the complex follow from a faith that sets aside good works, which are the goods of life. Moreover, every religion has life as its end; for it teaches the evils that must be shunned, and the goods that are to be done. A religion that does not have life as its end, consequently a religion in which it is taught that the works of life are of no account, but faith alone, cannot be called a religion; and where this is taught, are not all evils of life permitted so far as they are not forbidden and restrained by the civil laws, since faith alone covers, remits, and takes them away? That this is so can be seen from this, that faith alone is said to justify the life; and yet it is taught that man is not saved by any good of life, also that he may be saved by this faith even in the last hour of death, also that he is justified at the same moment that he receives this faith, with other like things, which altogether persuade that life is not the end of that religion. And if religion does not have life as its end it follows that it must give loose reins to evils of every kind."

But it has been shown above what the quality of this faith is, and what there is in it of truth and untruth; and anyone can see that in this faith there is nothing except thought, and nothing of life; for it is said that if we believe this with trust and confidence, that is, if we acknowledge it in thought, we are saved. If in this faith alone there is salvation what need is there of knowing what love to the Lord is, what charity towards the neighbor is, what the life of man is, what the goods and evils of life are, what remission of sins is, what reformation and regeneration are? Are not all these this faith alone? If it be asked what remission of sins is, is it not this faith alone? If it be asked what charity towards the neighbor is, is it not this faith alone? If it be asked what the church is, is it not this faith alone? So in the rest. It is clear, therefore, that this faith alone has absorbed, and has swallowed up like a dragon, all the goods and truths of the Word, and thus of the church, although these are innumerable, and through these the angels have all their intelligence and wisdom, and men have all their salvation. [5] As all the truths and goods of the church have been banished by means of this faith alone, it follows that falsities and evils therefrom have taken their place, and as a consequence the church is devastated. Yea, by means of this truth that man of himself can do no good that is good, all the truths and goods of the church are cast aside, as if this made it permissible for man to refrain from doing them, because if they are not good they are rather damnable than saving. And it is wonderful that through a single truth wrongly understood all the truths and goods of the church in the whole complex should have been cast aside. This is what is signified in the spiritual sense by “the number of the beast, six hundred sixty-six.”"

This is evident from the signification of “I saw,” as being the things seen by John, which now follow; these, regarded in the spiritual sense, treat of the calling together and assembling of the faithful, and their separation from the evil before the last judgment; and this is meant by the Lord by these words in Matthew: They shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and glory; and He shall send His angels and shall gather together His elect from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other (24:30, 31). That chapter treats also of the last judgment, which is there meant by “the consummation of the age and the coming of the Lord.” The gathering together of the good and their separation from the evil is there described by those words, as well as in this chapter (verses 14, 16), where the Son of man is described as sitting upon a white cloud with a sickle in His hand reaping the earth. [2] Similar things in this chapter are meant also by these words of the Lord in Matthew: The kingdom of the heavens is like unto a man that sowed good seed in his field; but while men slept his enemy came and sowed tares and went away. But when the blade sprang up and brought forth fruit then appeared the tares. And the servants came and said, Wilt thou then that going we gather them up? But he said, Nay, lest haply while ye gather up the tares ye root up at the same time the wheat with them. Rather let both grow together until the harvest; and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Collect first the tares and bind them in bundles to burn them; but gather the wheat into my barn (13:24–30). Here the separation of the good from the evil, which was to take place at the time of the last judgment, is foretold by the Lord, and is meant by “Let both grow together until the harvest, and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Collect the tares to burn them, but gather the wheat into my barn.” The “tares” mean the evil, who will then be cast into hell, and the “wheat” means the good, who having been separated from the evil will be raised up"

And he that sat upon the cloud cast in his sickle upon the earth; and the earth was reaped (verses 15, 16, and what follows). Why the good were not separated from the evil previous to the time of the last judgment, and the good raised up to heaven and the evil cast into hell, can be seen in the work on the Last Judgment, and also above (n. 391a, 392a, 394, 397, 411a, 413a, 418a, 419a, 426, 489_, 493, 497, 668, 669, 670, 674, 675a, 676, 754). 850a.

This is evident from the signification of “Lamb,” as being the Lord as to the Divine Human (see above, n. 297, 314, 343, 460, 482); also from the signification of “standing,” as meaning to be present and to be conjoined (of which presently); also from the signification of “the Mount Zion,” as being heaven and the church, where the Lord reigns by His Divine truth, as can be seen from the passages in the Word where “Mount Zion” is mentioned. But first something shall be said about the Lord’s presence in heaven and in the church, for separating the good from the evil and for executing judgment. The presence of the Lord is perpetual in the whole heaven and in the whole church; for heaven is not heaven from what is the angels’ own (proprium) in it, nor is the church a church from what is men’s own in it, but from the Divine of the Lord with them. For an angel’s own cannot make heaven, nor a man’s own the church, since the own, both of angels and of men, is not good. Consequently it is the Divine that goes forth from the Lord, as received by them, that makes heaven and the church in particular with each one, and thus makes heaven and the church in general in all in whom heaven and the church exist. Thence it is evident that the presence of the Lord is perpetual with all who are in heaven and in the church; but it is a presence that is peaceful, tranquil, preserving, and sustaining, by which all things in the heavens and on the earth are held constantly in their order and connection, or are reduced to that order; so, too, in the hells.

But this presence and conjunction of the Lord with the heavens and His consequent influx into the lower parts to effect the judgment has been treated of above (n. 413a, 418a, 419a, 426, 489_, 493, 702, 704). It is this presence that is signified elsewhere by “standing,” when attributed to the Lord (as in Isaiah 3:13). From all this it can be seen that “behold a Lamb standing on the Mount Zion” signifies the presence of the Lord in heaven and in the church, for separating the good from the evil and for executing judgment. [2] “Mount Zion” signifies heaven and the church where the Lord reigns by His Divine truth, for the reason that Zion was a city built by David, and in which he afterwards dwelt, and was therefore called “the city of David,” and as “David” represented the Lord in respect to His royalty, which is the Divine truth, “Zion” signifies in the Word heaven and the church, where the Lord reigns by His Divine truth. For the same reason the ark of Jehovah, in which the law was deposited, was carried into that city by David; for that law also signifies in a broad sense Divine truth going forth from the Lord. And for the same reason Jerusalem, which lay below that mountain, signifies the church in respect to doctrine; for every doctrine of the church is from the Divine truth that goes forth from the Lord, consequently is from the Word. That city was built upon a mountain for the reason that at that time mountains, because of their height, represented the heavens, and thence also in the Word signify the heavens. The ground of this representation and consequent signification is that the highest heavens, in which are the angels of the third degree, appear at a height above the rest, and before the eyes of others like mountains; and as the highest heavens appear like mountains, and the angels who are upon them are in love to the Lord, so “mountains,” and especially “Mount Zion,” signify in the Word love to the Lord. (That a “mountain” signifies love see above, n. 405, 510.)"

I will give the nations for Thine inheritance, and the ends of the earth for Thy possession. Kiss the Son, lest He be angry and ye perish in the way, for His anger will shortly burn forth. Happy are all they that trust in Him (Ps. 2:6–8, 12). This evidently was not said of David, but of the Lord, for it is said, “Thou art My Son, this day have I begotten Thee. I will give the nations for Thine inheritance, and the ends of the earth for Thy possession”; also “Kiss the Son, lest He be angry and ye perish in the way; Happy are all they that trust in Him”; nothing of which can be said of David. Therefore “to anoint a king upon Zion, the mountain of holiness,” signifies the Lord’s rule in heaven and in the church by means of Divine truth. (What “to be anointed” and “one anointed” signify, in reference to the Lord, may be seen above, n. 375d, e [5, 6].) “King” signifies the Lord in respect to Divine truth, “Zion” heaven and the church, and “to declare the decree” His coming; “Thou art My Son, this day have I begotten Thee,” signifies the Divine Human, which also is the Son of God; that He has all power in the heavens and on earth is meant by “I will give the nations for Thine inheritance, and the ends of the earth for Thy possession”; that there must be conjunction with Him by love that there may be salvation is signified by “Kiss the Son, lest He be angry and ye perish in the way.” The last judgment by Him is signified by “His anger will shortly burn forth”; that those who have faith in Him will then be saved is signified by “Happy are all they that trust in Him.” All this makes evident that “Zion” means heaven and the church, where the Lord reigns by means of His Divine truth.

That “riding upon an ass and upon a foal of an ass” was a sign of royalty, and therefore the Lord so rode when He entered Jerusalem, and He was therefore called King by the multitude crying aloud, and branches of palm trees and garments were strewn upon the way before Him (verses 7–9), may be seen above (n. 31b), and as the Lord thus entered Jerusalem as a King it is evident that “Zion” means heaven and the church, in which the Lord reigns by means of His Divine truth. That the kings of Judah and Israel represented the Lord as to the Divine truth, and that consequently “kings” mean those who are in truths from good from the Lord can be seen above (n. 31, 553, 625); and that especially David represented in the Word the Lord as to royalty, which is the Divine truth (n. 205). 850b.

As this is said of the Lord and of His Kingdom, and this is signified by “Zion and Jerusalem,” it is said that “Zion and Jerusalem should proclaim it as good tidings,” Zion from good of love, and Jerusalem from truths of doctrine. To proclaim good tidings from good of love is meant by “getting up into a high mountain”; and proclaiming good tidings from truths of doctrine is meant by “lifting up the voice with strength”; “the cities of Judah” signify the doctrine of love to the Lord and love towards the neighbor in the"

The Lord as to the Divine truth and the Divine good, who was to come and execute judgment, is meant by, “Behold your God! behold the Lord Jehovih cometh in strength”; for the Lord is called “God” in the Word from Divine truth, and “Jehovah,” and also “Lord Jehovih,” from Divine good; and “to come in strength” is to execute judgment, and thus to subjugate the hells. [6] In Micah: In the end of the days it shall be that the mountain of the house of Jehovah shall be established in the head of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and peoples shall flow unto it. And many nations shall come and say, Come and let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah, to the house of the God of Jacob, that He may teach us of His ways and that we may go in His paths; for from Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of Jehovah from Jerusalem. Then shall He judge among many nations, and shall reprove numerous nations, even afar off. Jehovah shall rule in Mount Zion from henceforth even forever. Thou, O tower of the flock, O hillside of the daughter of Zion, unto thee shall come and shall return the former kingdom, the kingdom of the daughter of Jerusalem (4:1–3, 7, 8). Anyone can see that the coming of the Lord and of His kingdom in the heavens and in the earth are here described; therefore His kingdom, which is heaven and the church, is meant by “the mountain of the house of Jehovah” that will then be established in the head of the mountains. And as “Zion” means heaven and the church in which the Lord is to reign by His Divine truth, while “Jerusalem” means heaven and the church as to doctrine from that Divine truth, it is said, “from Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of Jehovah from Jerusalem.” The instruction of all from the Lord is described by what then follows.

These passages respecting Zion are quoted that everyone may see that in the Word “Zion” does not mean Zion, but heaven and the church where the Lord reigns by means of His Divine truth. Most of these are also prophetic of the Lord, that when He came He would love Zion and dwell there forever; and yet He did not love that city nor Jerusalem, as is evident from His words respecting them; but He loved heaven and the church, where He is received through His Divine truth. This is why Zion is called “His rest,” “His dwelling place,” “the mountain of Jehovah,” “the city of God,” “the city of the great King,” “the city of truth,” and it is said that His kingdom shall be there “to eternity,” “forever,” and “to generation and generation”; none of which things could by any means be said of the Zion of David, or be meant by it. 850d. [9] As the Lord came into the world to execute judgment, and thereby reduce all things in the hells and in the heavens to order; and as judgment is effected by Divine truth, since this, according to reception, is what makes man spiritual, and according to its laws, which are the Divine commandments in the Word, all judgments are effected in the spiritual world, so the Lord assumed the Human, and during His life in the world made it Divine truth, to the end that He might execute judgment, as has been said. That the Lord made His Human Divine truth is meant in John by: The Word that was with God, and that was God, and by which all things were made that were made, and by which the world was created (1:1, seq.). “The Word” means Divine truth. That the Lord became Divine truth as to His Human is clearly stated as follows: And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, glory as of the only-begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth (John 1:14).

Since, then, the Lord executed judgment by His Divine truth, and since “Zion” means heaven and the church, in which the Lord reigns by His Divine truth, it is said in this chapter of Revelation, which treats of the separation of the good from the evil before the last judgment, that “a Lamb was seen standing upon the Mount Zion,” which signifies the presence of the Lord in heaven and in the church for separating the good from the evil and for executing judgment, as has been said above. [10] Because “the mount of Zion” has the same signification elsewhere in the Word, it is said that the Lord will fight from Mount Zion for the church against the evil, and will destroy them; as in the following passages. In Isaiah: Jehovah of Hosts shall come down to fight upon the mount of Zion and upon the hill thereof (31:4). This, too, treats of the coming of the Lord and of the redemption or deliverance of the faithful; therefore “to fight upon the mount of Zion and upon the hill thereof” signifies to execute judgment by Divine truth, by which judgment is executed because all are judged according to their reception of it; since Divine truth, or the Word and doctrine therefrom, teach life, and everyone is judged according to the life. [11] In David: Jehovah will send help for thee out of the sanctuary, and will sustain thee out of Zion. We will sing of thy salvation, and in the name of our God we will set up our banners. I know that Jehovah saveth His anointed; He answereth him from the heaven of His holiness with the might of the salvation of His right hand (Ps. 20:2, 5, 6). This, too, was said of the Lord and of His victory over the hells, and the consequent salvation of men. Combats and victories are meant by “answering His anointed from the heaven of His holiness with the might of the salvation of His right hand,” and the salvation of the faithful thereby is meant by “His sus-taining us out of Zion,” and by “singing of His salvation.”"

The separation of the good from the evil is meant by “He shall call the earth from the rising of the sun to its going down.” Judgment upon all is meant by “He shall cry out to heaven above and to the earth to judge the people.” The gathering together of the good and their salvation is meant by “gather My saints together unto Me.” Divine truth, in which the Lord is in His glory, is meant by “Out of Zion the perfection of beauty God shall shine forth.” [13] In the same: The saying of Jehovah to my lord, Sit thou at My right hand, until I make thine enemies a stool for thy feet.

Here Zion is called “the king’s strength” from the Divine truth which has power itself. [17] In the same: O Jehovah, Thou shalt arise and have mercy upon Zion, for it is time to pity her, for the set time is come; for Thy servants desire the stones thereof, and pity the dust thereof, that the nations may fear the name of Jehovah, and all the kings of the earth Thy glory; because Jehovah hath built up Zion, and hath appeared in His glory. The name of Jehovah shall be declared in Zion, and His praise in Jerusalem, when the peoples shall be gathered together, and the kingdoms, to serve Jehovah (Ps. 102: 13–16, 21, 22). This treats of the Lord’s coming and of the redemption of the faithful by Him.

This does not mean that the twelve disciples were to sit upon twelve thrones and judge the twelve tribes of Israel, but it means that the Lord is to judge all according to truths from good, which are from Him, for “the twelve disciples” signify all who are of the church, and in an abstract sense all things of the church, which are truths from good. (But this may be seen explained above, n. 9, 206, 253b, 270, 297, 430 c).

(That this is the signification of “elders” see above, n. 270; also of “princes,” n. 29, 408). [3] “A hundred forty-four thousand” means truths in the whole complex, because that number has a similar signification as the number “twelve” and “twelve” signifies truths and goods in the whole complex. “A hundred forty-four thousand” has a similar signification as twelve because composite numbers have a similar signification as the simple numbers from which they arise by multiplication; and the number one hundred forty-four arises from the multiplication of twelve by twelve. Again, one hundred forty- four thousand has a similar signification as one hundred forty-four. But on this see many things that were said in the explanation of the seventh chapter, which treats of the twelve thousand sealed out of each tribe, and the one hundred forty-four thousand sealed out of all the tribes together. 852a.

This is evident from the signification of “the name of His Father,” as being the Divine of the Lord (of which presently), also from the signification of “written on the foreheads,” as being full acknowledgment. “The name of the Father written on the forehead” means the full acknowledgment of the Divine of the Lord, because the Lord turns towards Himself all who acknowledge His Divine, and looks at them in the forehead, while they on the other hand look at the Lord with the eyes; and this for the reason that the “forehead” signifies love, and the “eye” the understanding of truth; therefore to be looked at by the Lord in the forehead signifies to be looked at by the Lord from the good of love; and on the other hand their looking at the Lord with the eyes signifies to look from truths from that good, consequently from the understanding of truth.

[2] One who does not know what the Word is in the sense of the letter might think that when “God and the Lamb” are mentioned, and here “the Lamb and the Father,” two are meant, and yet the Lord alone is meant by the two. It is the same in the Word of the Old Testament, where mention is made of “Jehovah,” “the Lord Jehovih,” “Jehovah of Hosts,” “Lord,” “Jehovah God,” “God” in the plural and in the singular, “the God of Israel,” “the Holy one of Israel,” “the King of Israel,” “Creator,” “Savior,” “Redeemer,” “Shaddai,” “Rock,” and so on; and yet by all these names only one is meant, and not many; for the Lord is named variously according to His Divine attributes. So again, in the Word of the New Testament, where “Father,” “Son,” and “Holy Spirit,” are mentioned as three; and yet by these three names one only is meant; for “Father” means the Lord as to the Divine Itself which He had as the soul from the Father; “the Son” means the Divine Human; and “the Holy Spirit” the Divine proceeding; thus the three are one, the same as “the Lamb” and “the Father” are here. [3] That when the Lord mentioned the Father He meant the Divine in Himself, and thus Himself, can be seen from many passages in the Word of both Testaments; but I will here quote a few from the Word of the Gospels, from which it can be seen that by “the Father” the Lord meant the Divine in Himself, which was in Him as the soul is in the body; and that when He mentioned the Father and Himself as two He meant Himself by both, for the soul and the body are one, the soul belonging to its body, and the body to its soul. That the Divine which is called “the Father” was the Divine Itself of the Lord from which His Human existed, and from which it was made Divine, is clearly evident from His conception from the Divine Itself.

But Mary said unto the angel, How shall this be, since I know not a man? And the angel answered and said, The Holy Spirit shall come upon thee, and the power of the Most High shall overshadow thee; therefore that Holy Thing that shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God (1:31, 32, 34, 35). From this it is evident that the Lord from conception is Jehovah God; and to be Jehovah God from conception is to be so as to the life itself, which is called the soul from the Father, from which the body has life. From this it is clearly evident that it is the Lord’s Human that is called the Son of God, for it is said “the Holy Thing that shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.” 852b. [4] That it is the Lord’s Human that is called “the Son of God” can be seen further from the Word of both the Old and New Testaments in many passages. But this subject, God willing, shall be particularly discussed elsewhere; here only such passages will be quoted as testify that by “the Father” the Lord meant the Divine in Himself, thus Himself, as follows. In John: In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and God was the Word. All things were made by Him, and without Him was not anything made that was made. And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we saw His glory, the glory as of the only-begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth (1:1, 2, 14). Evidently “the Word” means the Lord as to the Divine Human, for it is said that “the Word became flesh, and we saw His glory, the glory as of the only-begotten of the Father.” It is also evident that the Lord is God even as to the Human, that is, that the Lord’s Human is also Divine, for it is said, “the Word was with God, and God was the Word”; and this Word became flesh. “The Word” means the Lord as to Divine truth."

But the Jews sought to kill Him, because He said that God was His own Father, making Himself equal with God. But Jesus answered and said, The Son can do nothing of Himself except what He seeth the Father doing; for whatever things He doeth these also the Son doeth in like manner. As the Father raiseth up the dead and quickeneth them, even so the Son quickeneth whom He will. He that honoreth not the Son honoreth not the Father which sent Him. Verily, verily, I say unto you that the hour is coming when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God; and they that hear shall live. As the Father hath life in Himself so also gave He to the Son to have life in Himself (John 5:17–27). That “the Father” means here the Divine in the Lord, which was His life, as the soul of the father is in every man, and that “the Son” means the Human, which lived from the Divine Itself which was in Him, and thus became Divine, consequently that Father and Son are one, is evident from these words of the Lord, namely, that “the Son doeth like things as the Father,” that the Son like the Father “raiseth up the dead and quickeneth them,” that the Son like the Father “hath life in Himself,” and that “they that hear the voice of the Son shall live”; from all which it is clearly evident that the Father and the Son are one as soul and body are; as well as from the fact that “the Jews sought to kill Him because He said that God was His own Father, making Himself equal with God.” [6] In the same: All that which the Father giveth to Me shall come unto Me.

If I do not the works of My Father believe Me not; but if I do, believe the works, that ye may know and believe that the Father is in Me and I in the Father (John 10:28–38). Here the Lord speaks of the Father as of another, saying, “No one shall pluck the sheep out of my Father’s hand,” also, “If I do not the works of My Father believe Me not, but if I do, believe the works”; and yet that they might not believe that the Father and He were two He saith, “The Father and I are one”; and that they might not believe that they were one merely by love, He adds, “that ye may know and believe that the Father is in Me and I in the Father.” From this it is clear that by “the Father” the Lord meant Himself, or the Divine in Himself from conception; and that by “the Son whom the Father sent” He meant His Human, for this was sent into the world by being conceived of God the Father and born of a virgin. [8] In the same: Jesus cried out and said, He that believeth in Me believeth not in Me but in Him that sent Me, and He that seeth Me seeth Him that sent Me.

From this also it is clear that by “the Father” the Lord meant Himself, and by “the Son whom the Father sent” His Divine Human, for He says, “He that seeth Me seeth Him that sent Me,” also “he that believeth in Me believeth not in Me but in Him that sent Me”; and yet He says that they are to believe in Him (verse 36, and elsewhere). [9] In the same: Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into His hands, and that He came forth from God and returned to God, said, He that receiveth Me receiveth Him that sent Me (John 13:3, 20)."

[10] In the same: I am the way, the truth, and the life; no one cometh to the Father but through Me. If ye have known Me ye have known My Father also; and henceforth ye have known Him and have seen Him. Philip saith unto Him, Lord, show us the Father.

Here it is plainly declared that the Father and He are one, and that the union is like the union of soul and body; thus that it is such a union that he who seeth Him seeth the Father. This union is further confirmed in this chapter. And as the union was such, and as no one can approach the soul of man but only the man himself, the Lord says: That they should go to Him and should ask the Father in His name, and that He would give to them (John 16:23, 24). [11] This union is also meant by: He went forth from the Father and came into the world, and again He leaves the world and goeth to the Father (John 16:5, 10, 16, 17, 28.)

This is life eternal, that they may know Thee the only God, and Jesus Christ whom Thou hast sent. All Mine are Thine, and Thine are Mine (John 17:2, 3, 10). Here, too, it is plainly declared that all things of the Father are the Lord’s, as all things of the soul are man’s; for man and the soul are one, as life and the subject of life are one. That even as to the Human the Lord is God is evident from these words of the Lord, “that they may know Thee the only God, and Jesus Christ whom Thou hast sent.” [12] As “the Father” and “the Son of God” are one, the Lord says that: When He cometh to judgment He will come in the glory of His Father (Mark 8:38; Luke 9:26); And in His own glory (Matt. 25:31); And that He hath all authority in the heavens and on the earth (Matt. 28:18). [13] That “the Son of God” means the Lord’s Divine Human is also made manifest in other passages in the Word; also in passages in the Old Testament. As in Isaiah: Unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given, upon whose shoulder is the government; and His name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, God, Mighty, the Father of Eternity, Prince of Peace (9:6). And in the same: A virgin shall conceive and shall bear a Son, and His name shall be called God-with-us (Isa. 7:14). Evidently “a Child born” and “a Son given” here mean the Lord as to the Divine Human. And that the Lord is God also as to it, thus that His Human is Divine, is clearly said, for it is said that “His"

Nor indeed could He have meant any other. Thus the Divine and the Human in the Lord, according to the doctrine of the Christian world, are not two but one person, altogether like soul and body; as is declared in clear terms in the Athanasian Creed. And as God and Man in the Lord are not two but one Person, and thus are united like soul and body, it follows that the Divine which the Lord had from conception was what He called “the Father,” and the Divine Human was what He called “the Son”; consequently that they were both Himself. From these things it can now be seen that “the name of the Father written on their foreheads” means the Lord as to His Divine. 853. Verses 2, 3. And I heard a voice from heaven as the voice of many waters and as the voice of a great thunder. And I heard a voice of harpers harping on their harps; and they were singing as it were a new song before the throne and before the four animals and the elders; and no one was able to learn the song save the hundred forty-four thousand, those bought from the earth. 2. “And I heard a voice from heaven as the voice of many waters,” signifies the glorification of the Lord from the Divine truths that are from Him (n. 854); “and as the voice of a great thunder,” signifies glorification of the Lord from His celestial kingdom (n. 855); “and I heard a voice of harpers harping on their harps,” signifies glorification of the Lord from His spiritual kingdom (n. 856); 3. “And they were singing as it were a new song,” signifies respecting acknowledgment and confession of the Lord (n. 857); “before the throne and before the four animals and the elders,” signifies with all in the entire heaven (n. 858); “and no one was able to learn the song save the hundred forty-four thousand,” signifies that acknowledgment and confession of the Lord was possible only with those who are in faith from charity, or in truths from good (n. 859); “those bought from the earth” signifies those who having been instructed, have received that acknowledgment in the world (n. 860)."

This is evident from the signification of “a voice from heaven” as being the glorification of the Lord, since “a voice from heaven” involves the things thus spoken, and these here follow, and are especially contained in “the new song,” by which acknowledgment and confession of the Lord are signified. Also from the signification of “many waters,” as being Divine truths that are from the Lord. That “waters” signify in the Word Divine truths, may be seen above (n. 71, 483, 518); and because this is the signification of “waters” therefore speech is sometimes heard from heaven as the sound of flowing waters; such was the sound of the voice of the Son of man walking in the midst of the lampstands: Whose voice was as the sound of many waters (Rev. 1:15). Also in the following words: I heard the voice of a great multitude, and as it were the voice of many waters, and as it were the voice of mighty thunders (Rev. 19:6). And again: The sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard like the sound of great waters (Ezek. 1:24). 855. And as the voice of a great thunder, signifies glorification of the Lord from His celestial kingdom. This is evident from the signification of “voice,” as being glorification of the Lord, as above; also from the signification of “a great thunder,” as being glorification of the Lord from His celestial kingdom. “Thunder” signifies glorification from the celestial kingdom, because from it only sounds, and not expressions of speech, are heard; and for the reason that all who are in that kingdom speak from love, that is, from affection, which is of the heart; and when such speech flows down from that heaven toward the regions below it is heard as thunder. For all affections in the spiritual world are heard as sounds with their variations, but the thoughts therefrom become manifested by the articulations of sound which are called words.

But all who are in the spiritual kingdom speak from thought, which belongs to the understanding or soul; and when such speech flows down out of heaven towards the regions below it is heard either as a voice or as harmonious music, or is seen before the eyes like the brightness of a cloud or like the flash of lightning before thunder. This is why “lightnings, thunders, and voices,” signify in the Word enlightenment, understanding, and perception (see above, n. 273, 702, 704); and why voices let down from the celestial kingdom are heard as thunders (n. 353, 393, 821b ). 856. And I heard a voice of harpers harping on their harps, signifies glorification of the Lord from His spiritual kingdom. This is evident from the signification of “voice,” as being glorification of the Lord, as above; also from the signification of “harpers harping with their harps,” as being the affections of those who are in the Lord’s spiritual kingdom; for the affections of such also are heard as sounds, but as the sounds of stringed instruments; for sounds from stringed instruments correspond to truths from good, or intellectual things in which are the angels of the Lord’s spiritual kingdom; but sounds from wind instruments correspond to goods, in which are the angels of the Lord’s celestial kingdom. (That these are correspondences see above, n. 323a, 326; and that “harps” signify confessions from spiritual truths, and “psalteries” confessions from goods, n. 323.) Now because the heavens are divided into two kingdoms, namely, into the celestial kingdom, in which are the angels that are in the good of love, and into the spiritual kingdom, in which are the angels that are in the truths from that good, it is said that “the voice from heaven was heard as the voice of a great thunder, and as the voice of harpers harping with their harps,” by which is signified the glorification of the Lord from the celestial kingdom, that is, from the good of love, and His glorification from the spiritual kingdom, thus from truths from that good. 857.

Songs are mentioned in many passages of the Word, especially in David, and they signify confession and glorification of God by singing; and where it is said “a new song” confession and glorification of the Lord is signified, for this song is called new for the reason that in the churches before the Lord’s coming Jehovah was praised in songs; and after the Lord had come into the world and had manifested Himself He too was praised in songs; while now in the church that is hereafter to be established, which is meant by “the New Jerusalem,” the Lord alone will be praised; but as it was the same Lord in the ancient churches, although praised under the name “Jehovah” who is now called the Lord, and as thus the song respecting Him, regarded in itself, is not new, so it is said to be “as it were a new song.” Here, therefore, it is called new, because it is for the new church which is hereafter to be established by the Lord. 858. Before the throne and before the four animals and the elders, signifies with all in the whole heaven. This is evident from the signification of a “throne,” as being heaven in general, in particular the spiritual heaven, and in an abstract sense Divine truth proceeding from the Lord; consequently “throne” is predicated of judgment (see above, n. 253, 267, 297, 343, 460, 462, 477, 482). Also from the signification of “the four animals and four and twenty elders,” as being the higher heavens (see also above, n. 313a, 322, 362). Therefore “before the throne and before the four animals and the elders” signifies with all in the whole heaven. 859. And no one was able to learn the song save the hundred forty- four thousand, signifies that acknowledgment and confession of the Lord was possible only with those who are in faith from charity, or in truths from good. This is evident from the signification of “the new song,” as being acknowledgment and confession of the Lord (see just above, n. 857); also from the signification of “the hundred forty-four thousand,” as being all who are in truths from good, thus who are in faith from charity, and in a sense abstracted from persons, truths from good (see above, n. 430). That these are meant by “the hundred forty-four thousand sealed out of all the tribes” can be seen from the explanation of the seventh chapter, where “the"

[2] This makes evident that the words “no one was able to learn the song save the hundred forty-four thousand” signify that acknowledgment and confession of the Lord was possible only with those who are in faith from charity, or in truths from good. Acknowledgment and confession of the Lord is not possible with any others, because no others can receive influx from heaven, that is, through heaven from the Lord. For the Lord flows into the life of everyone; and the life of heaven is from love or charity, that is from good; and the quality of love or charity is formed by truths. From this, then, is man’s life; and therefore no other life receives influx out of heaven from the Lord, and thus acknowledges and confesses the Lord in heart, than the life of faith from charity or the life of truth from good. The life of faith separated from charity or the life of truth separated from good is a merely natural life, which receives nothing and can receive nothing from heaven, because from that life no communication with heaven is possible; for communication with heaven is given only through spiritual love, which is also called charity, that is, through a life according to truths from the Word; and that life is not given with those who separate faith from charity and believe that they are saved by faith alone, that is, by faith separated from good works. Since, then, “the hundred forty-four thousand” mean those who are in truths from good or who are in faith from charity, it is evident why they alone were able to learn the song, that is, were able to acknowledge and confess the Lord in heart, namely, that He is the only God, and that the trinity is in Him."

This is evident from the signification of “those bought,” that is, redeemed by the Lord, as being those who receive instruction from the Word, especially respecting the Lord (of which presently); also from the signification of “the earth,” as being the church (see above, n. 29, 304, 697, 741b-d, 742, 752); consequently “those bought from the earth” signify those who, having been instructed, have received in the church, and thus in the world, what the Lord has taught in the Word. It is to be known that only those who have acknowledged and confessed the Lord in the world can confess and acknowledge Him in the other life; for what a man is in regard to acknowledgment and confession therefrom in the world, such he remains after death. Some believe that those who have not had faith in the world will nevertheless receive faith in the other life when they hear from others and themselves see that it is so, as that there is a God, that the Lord is the Savior of the world, that the Word is holy, and the like; but I can testify that those who have not had faith in the world cannot have faith after death, even when they both hear from the angels and see with their own eyes that it is so. I have seen this tried with many who had not believed, that they might be induced to believe, but in vain; which made clear that what a man is when he dies such he remains to eternity. And this is what is meant by the five foolish virgins who had no oil in their lamps, but who wished to get oil for themselves; but when they had bought it and had come to the house of the wedding feast they were not admitted. “To buy oil” signifies to acquire the good of love for oneself after death. There are many such who acquire for themselves something after death, when they have become spirits; but this does not remain, because it has not been interiorly rooted, as it is with those who acquire those things for themselves in the world. [2] “Those bought from the earth” signify those who, having been instructed, have received the acknowledgment of the Lord in the world, because “to buy” signifies to acquire for oneself the knowledges of truth and good, which is done by instruction; thus “those bought” signify here those who having been instructed receive.

Those who having been instructed have received the faith of God are called by the Lord “bought,” because those who have been estranged by falsities are called “sold”; and for this reason those who have been led from falsities to truths, thus who have been delivered by the Lord from hell and have been led to heaven are called “the redeemed,” and the Lord is called “the Redeemer.” “To redeem” signifies in reference to the Lord to deliver from evils and to liberate from falsities, that is, from hell, and thus it signifies to reform and regenerate (as may be seen above, n. 328). “To redeem by His blood” signifies conjunction with the Divine through the acknowledgment of the Lord, and through reception of the Divine truth from Him (see n. 328, 329).

It is said that these hundred forty-four thousand “are not defiled with women, for they are virgins,” because these hundred forty-four thousand mean all who are in truths from good; and those who are in truths from good cannot falsify truths, because good opens the spiritual mind, which receives light from heaven and enlightens the natural mind; therefore when truths appear they are acknowledged and received, and falsities are rejected. It is altogether different with those who are in truths without good. Such are in falsities, although they believe themselves to be in truths. For truths without good have no light or life; consequently they are inwardly as it were black and dead; and therefore when interiorly regarded by such they are either falsified or are scattered as if they were nothing. Such are the truths of the Word with those who are in faith separated from charity. When these speak from the sense of the letter of the Word they can speak nothing else than truths, since all things of the Word are truths; and yet those things that constitute the sense of the letter are appearances of truth because they are for the simple and for little children, and therefore are adapted to their apprehension. But when one who is in faith separated from charity interiorly examines these appearances of truth and undertakes to draw forth their genuine meaning or genuine truth he falls into falsities, by which he destroys the very truths of heaven, and thus closes heaven to himself. It is otherwise with those who are in truths from good; for these are continually enlightened by the Lord; for the Lord flows into good, and through good into truths with man; but not into truths without good, thus not into faith without charity. 863a.

But natural affections of truth have reward as an end, at first reputation, and afterwards honor and gain. These are not the affections here meant by “virgins,” but spiritual affections of truth are meant, which are such as have for their end eternal life and the uses of that life. Those who are in such affections love truths because they are truths, thus apart from the world’s glory, honors, and gains; and those who love truths apart from such considerations love the Lord; for the Lord is with man in the truths that are from good. For that which proceeds from the Lord as a Sun is the Divine truth, and that which proceeds from the Lord is the Lord; consequently he that receives truth from spiritual love because it is truth receives the Lord. Therefore of such it is said “these are they that follow the Lamb whithersoever He goeth.” Moreover, such are meant by the Lord in these words in Matthew: The kingdom of the heavens is like unto a treasure hidden in a field, which a man having found hideth, and in his joy goeth and selleth all things whatsoever he hath, and buyeth the field. Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like unto a man, a merchant, seeking beautiful pearls, who, when he had found one precious pearl, went and sold all that he had, and bought it (13:44–46). “The treasure hidden in a field” and “the pearls” signify the truths of heaven and the church; and the “one precious pearl” signifies the acknowledgment of the Lord. The affection of truths because they are truths is meant by “the man went in his joy and sold all that he had, and bought the field” in which the treasure was hidden, also by “the merchant’s going and selling all that he had, and buying the precious pearl.” [2] Those who are in the spiritual affection of truth are called “virgins” from the marriage of good and truth from which is conjugial love; for a “wife” is the affection of good, and a “husband” the understanding of truth; moreover, females and males are born such. Now because virgins love to be conjoined to men with whom is the understanding of truth, therefore they signify the affections of truth.

In Lamentations: The ways of Zion do mourn because they come not to the feast; all her gates are devastated, her priests moan, her virgins are sad, and she herself is in bitterness.

The Lord hath trodden the wine press for the virgin daughter of Judah.6 Hear, I pray, all ye people, and behold my grief; my virgins and my youths have gone into captivity (1:4, 15, 18). This describes the devastation of Divine truth in the church, “Zion” of which this is said signifying the church, where the Lord reigns by the Divine truth. “The ways of Zion do mourn” signifies that Divine truths are no longer sought; “no one comes to the feast” signifies that there is at that time no worship; “all her gates are desolated” signifies that there is no approach to truths; “her priests moan, her virgins are sad,” signifies that affections of good and affections of truth are destroyed; “He hath cast down all my mighty in the midst of me” signifies that all power of truth against falsities has perished; “He hath proclaimed against me an appointed time” signifies its last state, when the Lord is about to come; “for breaking my youths” signifies when there is no longer any understanding of truth; “the Lord hath trodden the wine press for the virgin daughter of Judah”7 signifies when all the truths of the Word are falsified; “my virgins and my youths have gone into captivity” signifies when all the affection of truth and the understanding of truth have perished by falsities.

They have lain in the streets, the boy and the old man; my virgins and my youths have fallen by the sword (Lam. 2:10, 13, 21).

In this like things are involved. What is signified by “the women in Zion,” “the virgins in the cities of Judah,” and “the princes and old men,” has been explained above (n. 540, 555, 655). In Amos: Behold the days shall come in which I will send a famine in the land, not a famine for bread nor a thirst for waters, but for hearing the words of Jehovah. In that day shall the beautiful virgins and the youths faint for thirst (8:11, 13). This describes the lack of Divine truth. That lack is meant by “famine” and by “thirst”; therefore it is said, “not a famine for bread nor a thirst for waters, but for hearing the words of Jehovah.” That the affection of truth and the understanding of truth will cease because of this lack is signified by “in that day shall the beautiful virgins and the youths faint for thirst.” [5] In Isaiah:"

That none are reformed by those knowledges is signified by “I have not travailed, neither brought forth”; and that consequently there is no understanding of truth and no affection of truth is signified by “I have not trained up youths, I have not brought up virgins.” [6] In David: God shut up His people to the sword, and was wroth with His inheritance.

This, too, treats of the devastation of the church by falsities and evils. “God shut up His people to the sword, and was wroth with His inheritance” signifies that the church perished through falsities and evils, the “sword” signifies the destruction of truth by falsities, “to be wroth” destruction by evils, the “people” those of the church who are in truths, and “inheritance” those who are in goods, but here those who are in falsities and evils. “The fire hath devoured her youths” signifies that the love of self and thence the pride of self-intelligence have destroyed the understanding of truth; “her virgins are not wedded” signifies that the affections of truth have perished through non-understanding of truth; “her priests have fallen by the sword” signifies that the goods of the church, which are the goods of works, of charity, and of life, have been destroyed by falsities. [7] In Moses: Without shall the sword bereave, and from the chamb ers terror, both the youth and the virgin, the suckling with the old man (Deut. 32:25). “Without shall the sword bereave, and from the chambers terror,” signifies that falsity and evil, which are from within, shall devastate"

This is said of Jacob and Israel, by whom is meant in the highest sense the Lord, who was to destroy the evils and falsities that bore rule in the church about the time of His coming; the “nations” and “kingdoms” that He will scatter signify evils and falsities in general; “the horse and his rider” signify reasonings from falsities against truths; “the chariot and him who is carried therein” signify falsities of doctrine; “the old man and the boy” signify falsities confirmed and not confirmed; “the youth and the virgin” signify the understanding of falsity and the affection of it; “the shepherd and his flock” signify those who teach and those who learn; “the husbandman and his team” have a like signification; “governors and leaders” signify the principles of falsity and evil.

[10] In Joel: They have cast lots upon my people, and they have given a boy for a harlot, and have sold a girl for wine which they drank (3:3). “To cast lots upon the people” signifies to disperse the truths of the church by falsities; “to give a boy for a harlot” signifies to falsify the truths of the Word; “to sell a girl for wine” signifies to falsify the goods of the Word; “which they drank” signifies becoming imbued with falsity.

It is evident from the verses that precede (2–8), and from those that follow (16, 17), that this is said of the Lord. “King’s daughters” signify the affections of Divine truth; “the queen that was at his right hand in the best gold of Ophir” signifies heaven and the church, which are in Divine truths from Divine good; “to hear, to see, and to incline the ear,” which is said of the king’s daughter, signifies to hearken, to perceive, and to obey, thus to understand, to do, and to be wise, from the Lord. That she will then be acceptable to the Lord is signified by “then shall the king delight in thy beauty,” “beauty” is predicated of the affection of truth, for this is what constitutes the beauty of angels; “therefore bow thyself down to him” signifies worship from a humble heart. “And the daughter of Tyre shall send an offering” signifies worship by those who are in the knowledges of truth; “the rich of the people shall entreat thy faces” signifies adoration by those who are in intelligence from these knowledges; “the king’s daughter is all glorious within” signifies the spiritual affection of truth, which is called “glorious” from abundance of truth, while “within” signifies what is spiritual; “her clothing is inwrought with gold” signifies investing truths formed from the good of love; “she shall be brought unto the king in broidered work” signifies the appearances of truth, such as are in the sense of the letter of the Word; “the virgins that follow her, her companions,” signify the spiritual- natural affections of truth which serve; “with joy and exultation they shall be brought, they shall come into the king’s palace,” signifies with heavenly joy into heaven, where the Lord is.

In Zechariah: How great is His goodness, and how great is His beauty! Corn maketh the young men to grow, and new wine the virgins (9:17). This, too, is said of the Lord; and “His goodness and beauty” mean the Divine good and the Divine truth. “Corn maketh the young men to grow, and new wine the virgins,” signifies that the understanding of truth and the affection of truth are formed by good and truth from Him. It is evident from these passages that “virgins” signify in the Word the affections of truth, likewise from other passages (as Isa. 62:5; Jer. 2:32; Joel 1:7, 8; Ps. 148:12; Judges 5:30). [16] Because a “virgin” signified the affection of the genuine truth of the church, which is wholly in accord with the good of love, it was commanded: That the high priest should not take to wife a widow, or one divorced, or one polluted, a harlot, but a virgin of his own people, lest he profane his seed (Lev. 21:13–15; also Ezek. 44:22). The particulars of this may be seen explained above (n. 768d). It was because “virgin” signifies the affection of genuine truth, and her defilement signifies falsification of Divine truth, that to commit whoredom was so severely forbidden, that: If anyone should entice a virgin and lie with her he should pay her a dowry to be a wife for himself; but if her father should refuse to give her he should weigh him silver according to the dowry of virgins (Exod. 22:16, 17; Deut. 22:28, 29).

But “lying together in the field” signifies the falsification of the truth of the church before it has been accepted as a doctrinal; and this is not the adulteration of its good, since a “field” means the church, in which truth at first is implanted and afterwards grows and at length becomes a matter of doctrine; and for this reason the man only should die.

For the Lord so operates with man that man may follow Him as if of himself; thus does the Lord flow into man’s freedom; and this He does for the sake of the reception and implantation of truth and good with man and consequent reformation and regeneration. For unless it appeared to man that he followed the Lord as if of himself, that is, acknowledged His Divine and did His commandments as if of himself, there would be no appropriation and conjunction, and thus no reformation and regeneration. For everything enters into the man and becomes as if it were his own that man receives in freedom, that is, as if of himself, whether it be what he thinks and speaks or what he wills and does as if of himself. And yet man ought to believe, as the matter really is in itself, that he does these things not from himself but from the Lord; and this is why it is said that he must act not of himself but as if of himself. Another reason for this is that man has no perception of the Lord’s operation into his will and into his thought therefrom; for man knows nothing about his conjunction with angels; consequently he supposes that whatever he wills and thinks he wills and thinks from himself; therefore he cannot know otherwise than that this is done by himself; and yet all good flows in, that which he thinks, that which he wills, and that which he consequently does. And as he knows this from the doctrine of the church, namely, that all good is from God, he ought to believe that he does not do good of himself, although he does it as if of himself. This is meant by what the Lord taught in Mark: So is the kingdom of God as if a man should cast seed upon the earth, and should then sleep and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up he knoweth not how (4:26, 27).

[2] To acknowledge the Lord’s Divine Human and to do His commandments is to follow Him, because only those who do this can be conjoined to the Lord. That everyone is conjoined to the Lord according to the acknowledgment and confession of Him from the heart and according to the life, can be seen from this, that all the angels of heaven acknowledge no other Divine than the Divine of the Lord, and all angels of the heavens live according to the laws of order, which are His commandments, that is, they live in the Divine that proceeds from the Lord, which is called the Divine truth. Because they so live they live in a heavenly aura, or in a heavenly ether, into which none can be admitted except those who are in life from the Lord. If any others were to enter into that ether it would be like letting mice into a pipe out of which the air has been exhausted. [3] All this makes clear what is signified in the spiritual sense by “following the Lord whithersoever He goeth.” “To follow Him” has the same signification in the following passages. As in John: Jesus said, I am the light of the world; he that followeth Me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life (8:12). “I am the light of the world” signifies that He is the Divine truth itself; “he that followeth Me” signifies he that acknowledges His Divine and does His commandments; “shall not walk in darkness” signifies that he shall not be in falsities; “but shall have the light of life” signifies that he shall be in Divine truths, which teach man eternal life and lead to heaven. Here evidently “to follow the Lord” does not mean to follow Him, but to acknowledge His Divine and obey Him. [4] In the same: When the Shepherd of the sheep hath led forth His own sheep He goeth before them and the sheep follow Him, for they know His voice; but a stranger they do not follow, but flee from him, for they know not the voice of strangers. My sheep hear My voice, and I know them and they follow Me (John 10:4, 5, 27)."

[5] In the Gospels: Whosoever wills to come after Me let him deny himself and follow Me (Matt. 16:24; Mark 8:34; Luke 9:23). Evidently “to go after the Lord and to follow Him” is to deny self; and to deny self is to be led not by self but by the Lord; and he denies self who shuns and turns away from evils because they are sins; and when man turns away from evils he is led by the Lord; for he does the Lord’s commandments, not from self but from the Lord. “To follow the Lord” has the same signification elsewhere (as in Matt. 19:21, 28; Mark 2:14, 15; 3:7, 8; 10:21, 28, 29; Luke 18:22, 28; John 12:26; 13:36, 37; 21:19–22). [6] All this makes clear that to “follow the Lord” is to be led by Him and not by self; and only those who are not led by self can be led by the Lord; and everyone is led by self who does not shun evils because they are contrary to the Word and thus contrary to God; consequently because they are sins and are from hell. Everyone who does not thus shun and turn away from evils is led by self; and for the reason that the evil that is in man by heredity constitutes his life, because that is his own (proprium); and until such evils have been removed man does all things from them, thus from self. But it is otherwise when evils have been removed, which is done when he shuns them because they are infernal; then the Lord enters with truths and goods from heaven, and leads him. The chief reason is that every man is his own love; and man, as to his spirit, which lives after death, is nothing else than the affection which is of his love, and all evil is from his love, and thus belongs to his love; from which it follows that a man’s love or affection is reformed only by a spiritual shunning of evils and turning away from them, which is shunning them and turning away from them because they are infernal. From all this it can now be seen what it is “to follow the Lord whithersoever He goeth.”"

This is evident from the signification of “those bought by the Lord,” as being those who receive instruction from the Word, especially respecting the Lord, and who live according to it (see above, n. 860). The same are meant by those called “redeemed by the Lord”; and “the redeemed” are those who have been regenerated by the Lord and these are those who follow the Lord, that is, are led by Him (of whom just above). Also from the signification of “firstfruits of God and the Lamb,” as being those who have given themselves to the Lord and have been adopted by Him. That those who are of the new church are meant is evident from their being called “firstfruits to God and to the Lamb,” since those who are received in that church acknowledge the Lord’s Divine Human and live according to His commandments. No others are received in the new church which is called “the New Jerusalem,” because those who do not believe this and live thus are not in accord with the life of heaven, nor with the light there, nor with the heat there: for the light there is the Divine truth, which is the source of all intelligence and wisdom; and the heat there is the Divine good, which is the source of all love and charity. All man’s affection and thought therefrom not only is within him and constitutes his life but is also outside of him and constitutes the sphere of his life. This is why heaven is divided into societies according to the varieties of the affections and their thoughts; consequently unless the affections and the thoughts therefrom are spiritual, which are formed solely by the acknowledgment of the Lord and a life according to His commandments, they cannot be admitted into any society of heaven, for they are repugnant thereto; and this is why those who do not acknowledge the Lord’s Divine Human and do not live according to His commandments in the Word cannot be consociated with the angels of heaven. That this is so has been proved to me by much experience. There were some who had the same idea of the Lord as of any other man, and had lived in the faith of the present day, which is cogitation (or thought) without any good of life. As these believed that eternal life is merely being admitted into heaven, so according to their wish they were admitted into a certain society; but as soon as the light of heaven struck their eyes, their sight, and at the same time their understanding, began to be wholly darkened, and they began to fall"

[2] It shall now be told briefly what “firstfruits” signify in the Word. The signification of firstfruits is similar to that of “firstborn”; but “firstborn” is predicated of animals, and “firstfruits” of vegetables; thus “the firstborn” are such as are born first, and “firstfruits” are from the first products; and both of them signify the spiritual good that is first formed, which in itself is truth from good which is from the Lord. This has its origin in the fact that there are two minds in man, a natural mind and a spiritual mind. From the natural mind alone nothing is pro duced but evil and its falsity; but as soon as the spiritual mind is opened, good and its truth are produced; and that which is first produced is meant by the “firstborn” and the “firstfruits.” And as all things that are born and produced from the spiritual mind are from the Lord and not from man, these were sanctified to Jehovah, that is, to the Lord, because they were His, and thus were holy. And as that which is born or produced first signifies all things that follow in their order, as a leader is followed by his people, or a shepherd by his flock, so “the giving of the firstborn and the firstfruits to the Lord” signified that all the rest were also His. [3] But that this may come yet more clearly into the understanding it is to be known that the merely natural mind is formed to the idea or image of the world, but the spiritual mind to the idea or image of heaven; also that the spiritual mind is not opened to any man, except by the acknowledgment of the Lord’s Divine and by a life according to His commandments; and until this mind has been opened no good and no truth therefrom are produced; but as soon as it is opened these are produced, and what"

[4] Because this is what is signified by “firstfruits,” and because the things pertaining to the harvest, as wheat, barley, and the rest, and also wool, signified the goods and truths of heaven and the church, and the clean and useful beasts had a similar signification, so the firstborn of the latter and the firstfruits of the former were given to the Lord; and as the high priest represented the Lord as to His priestly function, which is the good of love, these things were given to that priest, and thus all things that were products of the corn, wine, and oil were made holy. But respecting these firstfruits see the statutes for the sons of Israel in the law of Moses; as respecting the first of the products of all corn, of oil, of wine, of the fruit of the tree, also of the fleece, likewise of the firstborn of the herd and the flock; and that these were given as holy to Jehovah, and by Jehovah to Aaron, and after him to the high priest (Exod. 22:29; Num. 13:20; 15:17–22; 18:8–20; Deut. 18:4; 26:1 to the end): also concerning the feast of the first fruits of harvest and of the first fruits of bread (Exod. 23:14–16, 19, 26; Lev. 23:9–15, 20–25; Num. 28:26 to the end; and elsewhere). [5] From all this it can now be seen that “firstfruits to God and to the Lamb” mean those who will be of the new church which is called “the New Jerusalem,” who acknowledge the Lord’s Divine Human and live a life of love, that is, a life according to the Lord’s commandments in the Word. In such and in no others is the spiritual mind opened; therefore no others are led by the Lord, or “follow Him whithersoever He goeth.” That “God and the Lamb” means in Revelation the Lord as to the Divine Itself, and at the same time as to the Divine Human, may be seen above (n. 297, 314, 343, 460, 482)."

This is evident from the signification of “mouth,” as being thought and speech therefrom, and thus persuasion; (see above, n. 580, 782, 794); also from the signification of “deceit,” as being to deceive and mislead purposely, thus from an intention of the will; consequently to think falsities and persuade to them designedly, which destroys man forever. That such things have no place in those who are led by the Lord or who follow Him is signified by “in their mouth is found no deceit.” For the Lord is Divine truth united to Divine good; and all who are in the Lord, who are those who acknowledge His Divine Human and do His commandments, are in the Divine truth and in the Divine good; and as thinking falsities is contrary to the Divine truth, and wishing to persuade to them is contrary to the Divine good, such are averse to so doing. [2] What else “deceit” signifies in the Word can be seen from the passages where it is mentioned, as in the following. In John: Jesus said of Nathaniel as he was coming to Him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no deceit (1:47). An “Israelite” signifies one who is in the good of charity, and from that in truths, thus one who is in truths from good. Such are meant also by “the hundred forty-four thousand who follow the Lord, in whose mouth is found no deceit”; so here “deceit” has the same signification. [3] In Zephaniah: The remnant of Israel shall not do perversity nor speak a lie, neither shall a tongue of deceit be found in their mouth (3:13). “The remnant of Israel,” the same as “an Israelite indeed,” means those who are in spiritual faith, because they are in the good of charity; “to speak a lie” signifies to teach falsely from ignorance of truth; but “deceit” signifies falsity that is not from ignorance of truth, but from deliberation, thus from the purpose of deceiving, as is the case with the wicked."

Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking deceit (Ps. 34:13). If my lips should speak iniquity, and my tongue should speak deceit (Job 27:4).

[5] Likewise respecting the prophets, in Jeremiah: Is it not in the heart of the prophets that prophesy falsehood, even of the prophets of the deceit of their own heart? (23:14). In the same: The prophets prophesy unto you a vision of falsehood and divinations, and a thing of nought, and the deceit of their own heart (Jer. 14:14). In the spiritual sense “prophets” signify those who teach truths from the Word and doctrine, and thus in an abstract sense the Word as to doctrine, therefore in the contrary sense, as in these passages, they signify those who teach falsities, thus those who falsify the truths of the Word; and to do this intentionally is meant by “the deceit of their heart.” [6] That “deceit” means in the spiritual sense intentional falsification of the truths of the Word, from a desire to mislead, is evident in Hosea: Ephraim hath compassed Me about with falsehood, and the house of Israel with deceit (11:12). “Ephraim” signifies the understanding of the truths of the church; and “the house of Israel” the church itself; so “deceit” and “falsehood” signify persuading to falsities with intention and desire.

They are compared to a “deceitful bow” because a “bow” signifies doctrine combating, in both senses, namely, the doctrine of falsity combating against truth, and of truth against falsity, for javelins and arrows signify falsities or truths to fight with. (That this is the signification of “bow and arrows” may be seen above, n. 357.) All this again makes evident that “deceit” means deceit in the spiritual sense, which is deceit against the truths and goods of the Word and of the church, thus a disposition and desire to destroy them. [8] That a disposition and desire to destroy the truths and goods of the Word, of doctrine, and of the church, thus to destroy them deliberately and intentionally, is signified by “deceit,” is evident in Jeremiah: They watch as fowlers lie in wait; they set a trap that they may catch men; as a cage full of birds so their houses are full of deceit (5:26, 27). In Moses: If a man have a purpose against his neighbor to slay him by deceit, thou shalt take him from Mine altar (Exod. 21:14). And as this was so grievous a sin it is said in Jeremiah: Cursed is he who doeth the work of Jehovah with deceit (48:10). “Deceit” was so grievous a crime because deliberation and purpose are of the will, and whatever is of the will is of the man himself, and is called the evil of his heart, for the will is the man himself; but the thought that precedes consent, which is an act of the will, is not in man but outside of him; since the things that flow into the thought are like the objects that flow into the sight from the world, some of which are pleasing and some not pleasing; and those that are pleasing enter the delight of his life, but those that are not pleasing are cast out.

If it is pleasing it enters his will and adds itself to his life; but if it is not pleasing it is cast out. [9] It is to be known that all evil persons have a disposition and desire, consequently a will, to destroy the truths of heaven and the church by falsities, for the reason that they are conjoined to hell, and infernal spirits from the delight of their love burn with a lust of destroying all things of heaven and the church, and this by crafty devices, which they artfully contrive and wonderfully execute, which, if described from experience, would fill many pages. This makes clear that “deceit” signifies in general all evil of intention to destroy truths by falsities. (In addition, see what has been said about deceit in the Arcana Coelestia, namely, that deceit destroys everything of the spiritual and interior life in man, n. 9013; that deceit, fraud, and simulation were accounted by the ancients monstrous wickedness, n. 3573; that the deceitful, when viewed by the angels, appear like serpents and vipers, n. 4533; that such are meant in the Word by “serpents” and “vipers,” n. 9013; that “poison” in the Word signifies deceit, n. 9013.

That “the throne of God” means heaven where the angels are may be seen above (n. 253a). They appear spotless in the sight of the angels of heaven because they are led by the Lord, and the Lord continually provides that nothing false shall enter their will; falsity is admitted into the thought, but no further, and is cast out therefrom; and what is cast out from the thought does not defile the man. But what is taken therefrom by his will, that defiles; for that belongs to and comes to be of his love, thus of his life, and inheres in his deeds; and this cannot be removed except by an earnest and actual repentance of the life.

But those who are in the Lord are kept in the spiritual affection of truth; and those who are in that affection may indeed receive falsities, although not with full consent, and only in such a manner and to such an extent as they agree with good and its truths. Therefore when those who are in the spiritual affection of truth imbibe falsities of any kind they easily reject them when they hear truths, either in this world or in the other. Such is the spiritual affection of truth. For this reason those who are in that affection are perfected in intelligence and wisdom to eternity; and they have also the faculty of understanding truths. But those who are not in that affection refuse both to understand and to listen to truths, and therefore have no faculty of understanding them. That this is so has been made plain to me from general experience in the spiritual world. [3] Now as the angels of heaven have no perception of anything in man except his love, and his affections, desires, and delights therefrom, and thus his ends, on account of which he thinks in a certain way and in no other, so when they perceive within him the love of truth for the sake of the uses of life, which are ends, they see no falsities from evil; and if they chance to see falsities not from evil they know that these falsi ties do no harm, because there is no evil in them. Falsities from evil are real falsities, which are from hell; such falsities are in themselves evils because they are forms of evil. [4] In respect to the term “spotless,” it signifies what is entire and without blemish, but in the spiritual sense it signifies to be without falsities from evil.

Having the eternal gospel, signifies respecting His coming and the salvation of those who believe in Him. This is evident from the signification of “gospel,” as being the Lord’s coming and the salvation at that time of those who believe in Him. (That there has been a coming of the Lord, and that He is yet to come at the time of the consummation of the age, that is, at the end of the old church and the beginning of the new, and at the same time will be the last judgment, may be seen above, n. 612.) Also from the signification of “eternal,” as being the Divine as to its existence (existere). There are two universals through which the Divine is expressed, namely, the infinite and the eternal. The infinite is the Divine as to its being (esse); and the eternal is the Divine as to its existence; each of which must be understood in a supereminent sense, namely, without space and without time. Anyone who thinks about the infinite and the eternal from space and time falls into errors; for space and time belong to nature, and man’s ideas are in these so long as he lives in the natural world, but are not in them when he leaves this world and comes into heaven. Spaces and times indeed appear in heaven exactly similar to those in the world; but they are only appearances of the states with angels, for the states of their affection and consequent thought are presented in appearance before their external senses as spaces and as times, and yet they are not spaces and times like those in the natural world. (What these are can be seen in two articles in the work on Heaven and Hell, which treat of space and time in heaven.) Because the Divine is infinite and eternal the infinite and eternal is in each and every thing that comes from the Divine; and this is why “the gospel,” which signifies the Lord’s coming and the salvation of the faithful, is called “eternal.” That the infinite and eternal are predicated of the Lord alone may be seen above (n. 23, 286).

[2] In respect to the Lord’s coming it is believed by some that the Lord will come again in person, and indeed, to accomplish the last judgment; and this because it is said in Matthew: The disciples drew near, saying unto Jesus, Tell us what shall be the sign of Thy coming and of the consummation of the age (24:3). And after the Lord had foretold to them the states of the church declining step by step even to its devastation and consummation, He said: Then shall appear the sign of the Son of man; and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and glory. Watch, therefore, for ye know not in what hour your Lord will come (verses 30, 39, 42; also in John 21:22). But His coming does not mean here His coming in person, but that He was then to reveal Himself in the Word that He is Jehovah the Lord of heaven and earth, and that all who will be in His new church which is meant by the New Jerusalem will adore Him alone; and to this end He has now opened the internal or spiritual sense of the Word, in which sense the Lord is everywhere treated of. This is the meaning also of: His coming in the clouds of heaven with glory (Matt. 24:30; 26:64; Mark 13:26; 14:62; Luke 21:27). That the “clouds of heaven” signify the Word in the letter, and “glory” its spiritual sense, may be seen above (n. 36, 594). Because He Himself is the Word, as He is called in John (1:1, 2, 14), therefore the revelation of Himself in the Word is “His coming.” 871.

In the sense of the letter “every nation, tribe, tongue, and people,” means all, of whatsoever religion they are; but in the spiritual sense it means all who live well and understand well. 873. Verse 7. Saying with a great voice, signifies exhortation. This is evident from the signification of “a great voice,” as being exhortation, since it involves what follows, where it is said that “they should fear God and give glory to Him.” The word “voice” is frequently used in the Word, also “a great voice”; and when it is a voice from the Lord or from His angels it signifies Divine truth in general, and everything that proceeds from the Lord, consequently commandment and precept, thus also exhortation, and other things (see above, n. 261, 302, 424, 668, 682); for a voice from the angels is not a voice from them but through them from the Lord. 874.

This is the signification of the Lord’s “glory” in the sense nearest to the letter. But all these magnificent things, which glow as if from gold and precious stones in wonderful forms, are given by the Lord according to the reception of Divine truth proceeding from Him, consequently they appear to the angels in the exact measure of the wisdom that is with them, for they are correspon dences. But since angels have wisdom according to their reception of Divine truth not only in doctrine but also in life, “to give glory to Him,” signifies to live according to Divine truth. [2] It is believed in the world that those have wisdom, and thus heaven, who know Divine truths and talk about them from knowledge, although they do not live according to them. But I can testify that such have no wisdom. They appear to have wisdom when they speak; but as soon as they are in their own spirit or think with themselves they are not at all wise, sometimes they are even demented like fools, thinking in opposition to the Divine truths which they have spoken. But it is otherwise with those who live according to Divine truths; such think wisely with themselves, and speak wisely with others. This it has been given me to know from a thousand examples of experience in the spiritual world; for there such things are manifest that are wholly unknown to men in the natural world. I have heard many there speak so wisely that I could have believed them to be interior angels of heaven; and yet they became devils, for they had filled their memory with such things from the love of glory, but had not lived according to them; consequently as soon as they returned to themselves and the love of their life they spoke in opposition to these things, and were as insane as if they had known nothing at all about them.

Abide ye in My love. If ye keep My commandments ye shall abide in My love. Ye are My friends if ye do whatsoever I command you (15:8–10, 14). This makes clear that “to glorify God,” or “to give glory to God,” means to bear fruit. See also what has been said before about glory; as that “glory” signifies the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord, and its reception by angels and men (n. 33, 288, 345); also that “the Lord’s glory” means the enlightenment of men and angels, and blessing them with wisdom and happiness; which is done solely through the reception of Divine truth in doctrine and at the same time in the life. 875. For the hour of His judgment is come, signifies the separation of those who live according to Divine truths from those who do not live according to them. This is evident from the signification of “hour,” as being state, here the last state of the church (of which presently); also from the signification of “judgment,” as being the separation of the good from the evil, thus of those who live according to the Lord’s Divine truths from those who do not; for the latter are the evil but the former are the good. That the last judgment means the separation of these can be seen from what has been said in the small work on the Last Judgment. That this is the separation of those who live according to Divine truths from those who do not live according to them can be seen from the passages in the Word where the last judgment is treated of, as in the twenty- fifth chapter of Matthew, where the separation of the sheep from the goats is described, the “sheep” being those who have done goods, and the “goats” those who have not done goods; also from passages in the Word where it is said that “everyone shall be judged"

It is said “the hour of judgment,” because “hour” signifies not only time but also state (the same as “day,” “week,” “month,” “year,” and time in general, as may be seen above, n. 571, 610, 664, 673, 747, 761; also concerning the signification of “hour” in particular, n. 194, 488, 673). “Hour” and “day” are so often mentioned in the Word on account of the spiritual sense in every particular of the Word; for while a man is thinking of hour and day, and thus of time, the angels, who are in the spiritual sense of the Word, are thinking of state; and for the reason that the angels have no idea of time because they have no days, weeks, months, and years, such as are in the world, but have changes of state, from which they measure things successive (see in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 162–169, where time in heaven is treated of). 876. And adore Him who made the heaven and the earth and sea and fountains of water, signifies the acknowledgment and confession of Him from whom is the all of heaven and the church, and from whom is the Divine truth or the Word. This is evident from the signification of “adoring,” as being to acknowledge in heart, thus to confess and worship (see above, n. 790a, 805a, 821a); also from the signification of “the heaven and the earth,” as being the internal and the external of the church (see above, n. 304a, b, e, f, 752); it also signifies heaven and the church, because with man the internal of the church is heaven, for it is in conjunction with the angels, even so as to make one with them; for, as has been said above, man’s internal is formed to the idea and image of heaven, but his external to the idea and image of the world. So long, however, as man lives in the world the church in him is in his natural, which is his external. Yet the church is in man’s natural or external only when the internal has been opened; for the church cannot exist with anyone unless he has heaven within, from which enlightenment and influx from the Lord may pass into the natural or external which is beneath. The above is evident also from the signification of “sea” as being the Divine truth in ultimate things, thus the Word in the letter, for this is Divine truth in ultimates. This is the signification of the “sea” because in the lowest parts of"

Those who dwell in it are in the ultimates of Divine truth, and that Divine truth is such as the Word is in the sense of the letter. It is from this that the “sea” has this signification. But on this see above (n. 275, 342, 511, 600a). The “sea” here signifies the Word in the letter, because it is said “sea and fountains of waters”; and “fountains of waters” signify interior Divine truth such as the Word is in its spiritual sense. That this is the signification of a “fountain of water” can be seen from passages from the Word and their explanation above (n. 483). That “fountains of waters” here signify Divine truths that are from the Word can be seen from this, that “the heaven and the earth” signify the internal and the external of the church; and both are formed by the Divine truth or the Word, as it is said in John (1:1, 2, 14), the internal of the church by spiritual Divine truth, and the external by natural Divine truth; and this is why “fountains of waters” are here mentioned among the things made by the Lord. [2] It can be seen from all this and from many other things how spiritual ideas, which are the ideas of angels, differ from natural ideas which are the ideas of men. To the angels, whose ideas are spiritual, “to adore Him who made the heaven and the earth and sea and fountains of waters” means nothing else than the acknowledgment and confession of the Lord, from whom is the all of heaven and the church, and from whom is the Divine truth, or the Word in its natural and spiritual sense. The angels so understand these words because the heavens in which they are, and which appear to the sight altogether like our lands, but full of paradises, flower beds, and shrubberies, are not permanent like the lands on our globe, but come into existence in a moment, in the exact measure of the reception of the Divine truth by the angels; consequently the aspects of all things there change as the state of reception and therefore of their intelligence and wisdom, changes, thus according to the states of the church with them, and this even"

So when “the heavens and the earth” are mentioned they can have no other idea than an idea of the church, because to them all things are from that. But men, when “the heaven and the earth” are mentioned, can have no such spiritual idea, because they are ignorant of such things; but they have a natural idea, which is according to what they see; for they see a heaven and an earth that are permanent, and that are not changed according to reception of the Divine truth, and thus of the church, as in the angelic heavens; consequently they mean by “heaven” nothing else than the visible heaven, and by “earth” nothing else than the earth inhabited by men. [3] The state of heaven and earth in accord with the state of the church was represented with the sons of Israel by changes in the aspect of the land of Canaan, where they dwelt, according to the states of the church with them, but only in respect to the products, namely, of the harvest, the oil, the vine, the fruits, and as to the rains. This took place because all things with them were representative of things celestial. This is why it is so often said in the Word that “the land should yield its increase” if they would keep the statutes and do them. But it is otherwise at this day, when the interior things of the church have been laid open by the Lord; and the external things that were representative of the interior things have ceased. All this makes clear what a difference there is between the ideas of the angels and the ideas of men respecting the new heaven and the new earth. For the angels from their ideas understand the destruction of the heavens and the earths in the spiritual world, but men the destruction of the heavens and the earths in the natural world. Moreover, according to the predictions, there has been a destruction of those heavens and earths in the spiritual world upon which were those who had lived a moral life in externals but not at the same time a spiritual life from internals. But of this more may be seen in the small work on the Last Judgment. 877. Verse 8.

Verse 8. And another angel followed, signifies manifestation by the Lord. This is evident from what has been said above respecting “the angel flying in the midst of heaven,” where also “angel” signifies manifestation by the Lord. Another angel was now seen because by the former angel manifestation was made in reference to the Lord’s coming and the separation of the good from the evil, and by this angel manifestation was made in reference to the last judgment as impending. 879. Saying, Fallen, fallen is Babylon, signifies the condemnation and destruction of those who have transferred to themselves the Lord’s Divine authority. This is evident from the signification of “Fallen, fallen,” as being that they were condemned and wholly destroyed; also from the signification of “Babylon,” as being those who have transferred to themselves the Lord’s Divine authority. It is said, “Fallen, fallen,” because it is said of Babylon as a city; but when “Babylon” means those who have transferred to themselves the Lord’s Divine authority, and “a great city” means all things of their doctrine, then “to fall” signifies to be destroyed. “To fall” is thus changed into “to be destroyed” in accordance with the subject predicated. What “Babylon” signifies in general and in particular will be told in chapters 17 and 18 which treat of Babylon and its destruction. This verse treats of Babylon; and the four following of the beast of the dragon; and what follows, to the end of this chapter, of the devastation of the church in general. Babylon and the beast of the dragon are here treated of because the devastation of the church, first in general and afterwards in particular, and finally the last judgment, are treated of in the verses that follow."

Every church in its beginning is in the love of doing goods, and in the love of knowing truths; but in process of time it is so devastated in respect to goods and truths that there is no longer any good or any truth in the church. In the first place, by degrees, it is devastated by the love of ruling over the souls of men, by means of holy things, and finally over heaven and over the Lord Himself. This is described in Revelation by “Babylon,” and by “the harlot sitting upon the scarlet beast.” Secondly, it is devastated by faith separated from charity and thus from the goods of life, and finally by faith alone in which there is nothing of truth. This is described in Revelation by “the dragon” and “his two beasts.” In these two, the primitive loves of the church, which were, as has been said, the love of doing goods and the love of knowing truths, came to an end; and when they had come to an end in these the church was devastated. The love of doing goods is changed by degrees into the love of doing evils that are called goods; and the love of knowing truths is changed into the love of knowing falsities that are called truths. [3] With those who are described by “Babylon” every good of the church is adulterated, and thus every truth of it, for the one is a consequence of the other; while with those who are described by “the dragon” every truth of the church is falsified, and thus every good of it, for the one is a consequence of the other. This latter takes place with the Reformed, who have accepted faith alone as the essential of the church; but the former takes place with the Papists, who have made dominion over the holy things of heaven the essential of the church. But in what way faith alone has devastated the church has been shown above, where “the dragon and his two beasts” are treated of; and how dominion over the holy things of heaven has devastated the church will be shown in the explanation of chapters 17 and 18. From all this it can now be seen why Babylon is spoken of in this verse, the beast of the dragon in the four verses that follow, and the devastation of the church in general from that to the end of the chapter, and afterwards the devastation of the church in particular in chapters 15 and 16."

This is evident from the signification of “falling” in reference to a city, as being to be devastated and destroyed (as has been said above, n. 879); also from the signification of a “city,” as being doctrine with all things thereof (see above, n. 223). It is said “a great city,” because doctrine full of evils and falsities therefrom is signified; for “great” is predicated of good, and in the contrary sense of evil (see above, n. 336a, 337). “Fallen is Babylon, that great city,” signifies that with those who are meant by “Babylon” all goods and truths are devastated, also that such will be wholly destroyed at the time of the last judgment; and that such were destroyed, and their great city, which was situated towards the south and towards the north, was wholly overthrown, and those in it were cast into hell, can be seen from what is related respecting Babylon in the small work on the Last Judgment. [2] This makes evident that “Fallen, fallen, is Babylon, that great city,” means two things, namely, the devastation of the church constituted of such in respect to all the goods and truths in the world, and their destruction at the time of the last judgment. It is believed that the destruction of Babylon means the destruction of that religion in the world. But its destruction is not meant, but its devastation in the world as to all the goods and truths of heaven and the church, thus the destruction of those who have transferred to themselves the Lord’s Divine authority, and have exercised it from love of self in reference to souls, and thus as to eternal life. For that religion will continue with those who continue in that love and who act from it. And as such destruction is meant, which is the devastation of the church, therefore the destruction of these in the other life is also meant in particular and in general, in particular the condemnation of all of those who were such from that religion, and in general the destruction of all who were such by the last judgment. 881.

(That “to drink” and “to give to drink” signify to imbue and to appropriate, may be seen above, n. 617a, c-e; and that “nations” signify those who are in the good of love and of life, and in the abstract sense the goods of the church, n. 175, 331, 625.) “To give all nations to drink” here signifies to adulterate the goods of the Word and thus of the church, because “the wine of the anger of whoredom” signifies the falsification of truth; and truth falsified adulterates good. But in what way all the truths of the Word are falsified and thus all its goods adulterated will be told in the explanation of chapters 16 and 17, where Babylon is treated of. From all this it can now be seen that “to give all nations to drink of the wine of the anger of her whoredom” signifies the adulteration of all things of the good of heaven and the church by direful falsities of evil. They are called falsities of evil because all falsities arising from the love of ruling for the sake of self and self-eminence are falsities of evil, and are direful according to that love. 882.

If anyone hath adored the beast and his image, signifies lest they acknowledge the religion of faith separated from life and its doctrine. This is evident from the signification of “the beast,” as being the religion of faith separated from life (of which presently); also from the signification of “to adore,” as being to acknowledge and believe (see above, n. 790a, 805a, 821a); also from the signification of “his image,” as being the doctrine of that religion, and the prescribed rule that such things only should be taught and believed (see above, n. 827a); “The beast” that with his image was not to be adored means the beast that came up out of the sea (described in the preceding chapter, verse 1), by which reasonings from the natural man confirming the separation of faith from the life were signified (see above, n. 774). That this beast is meant is evident from the fourteenth verse of the preceding chapter; but the other beast that was seen to come up out of the earth signifies confirmations from the Word in favor of such a separation (see above, n. 815a). They were not to adore the former beast and his image, and those that did adore them “should be tormented with fire and brimstone,” since passages of the Word cited to prove the separation of faith from good works, apart from reasonings from the natural man, do not implant falsity and evil, but this is done only by reasonings, for reasonings are what falsify these, and without reasonings from the natural man nothing in the Word can be falsified. How reasonings have falsified the Word has been shown above in many places. [2] That this is so can be seen especially in the churches where faith alone is accepted as the essential means of salvation, in that those who teach from their doctrine and thence from the Word teach in a wholly different way from those who teach from the Word and not at the same time from their doctrine.

Therefore many in those churches teach faith conjoined to life, and life conjoined to faith; but others teach faith separated from the life. This latter is done by the learned who teach from doctrine, but the former by the learned and unlearned who teach from the Word. Thus they go in opposite ways; and yet this is permitted by the defenders of the doctrine for the reason that the Word plainly teaches life and a faith according to life, and the simple-minded cannot be taught otherwise than according to the obvious sense of the Word. And some permit it because they cannot openly resist the truth; for truth operates and persuades in unknown ways, flowing in from heaven with everyone; and those receive it who do not live in evil, and who have not from childhood and from pride in being more learned than others confirmed themselves in the doctrine of faith alone, especially in the dogma of justification by it, in which they place the glory of superior learning. Nevertheless, these think otherwise in heart when they hear from others confirmations from the Word in favor of life; for they think that faith alone includes works in itself, and that the two are conjoined, according to the dogma of justification; although this dogma, as it is taught by many, separates works from faith more than it conjoins them with faith; it even sets them aside as not justifying so far as there is anything in them from man or from his will. [3] That in the churches where faith alone is accepted, the teaching that is from the Word and the teaching that is from doctrine are wholly different, can be confirmed by many instances; as in the Anglican Church and in the Lutheran Church. It is known that the doctrine of the Anglican Church teaches faith alone, and that the preachers skillfully, ingeniously, and gracefully join works to faith, as if they were stored up in it; and they perceive a kind of endeavor from faith, like an affection for doing good. This is especially true of those who have been justified by faith alone to the third or fourth degree. It teaches, moreover, that those whose faith alone has not been efficacious to that degree are"

But it has been shown above in the explanations of the twelfth and thirteenth chapters that these things are the offspring of a mind glorying and boasting in superior learning and ingenuity. To show that in the Anglican Church when they teach from the Word and not at the same time from doctrine the teaching is wholly different, I will here quote in proof what is taught in that church on every feast day, and is read by those who come to the Holy Supper. It is as follows: “The way and means thereto is, first, to examine your lives and conversations by the rule of God’s commandments; and whereinsoever ye shall perceive yourselves to have offended, either by will, word, or deed, there to bewail your own sinfulness and to confess yourselves to Almighty God, with full purpose of amendment of life. And if ye shall perceive your offenses to be such as are not only against God but also against your neighbor, then ye shall reconcile yourselves unto them; being ready to make restitution and satisfaction according to the uttermost of your power, for all injuries and wrongs done by you to any other; and being likewise ready to forgive others that have offended you, as ye would have forgiveness of your offenses at God’s hand; for otherwise the receiving of the holy communion doth nothing else but increase your damnation. Therefore if any of you be a blasphemer of God, an hinderer or slanderer of His Word, an adulterer, or be in malice, or envy, or in any other grievous crime, repent you of your sins, or else come not to the holy table; lest after the taking of that holy sacrament the devil enter into you, as he entered into Judas, and fill you with all iniquities, and bring you to destruction both of body and soul.” Here faith is not even named, but works only are taught, because all this is from the Word, and not at the same time from doctrine. [4] Moreover, the Athanasian faith, which is frequently read in the presence of the people in that church every year on feast days, and which, because it is the work of a council, has been accepted in all Christian churches as the common doctrine concerning the trinity, teaches thus respecting the Lord and the last judgment by Him: “All men shall give account for their own works. And they that have done good shall go into life everlasting; and they that"

This is the catholic faith, which except a man believe faithfully he cannot be saved.” Now consider, reflect, and examine, whether those who preach so ingeniously from doctrine, or who believe the same, do not include the above things in faith, as concealed in it. And as they believe that works do not justify, and that no one can do any good that is good from himself, and that good done by man has in itself merit, they give up doing, and believe that they are saved by the life concealed in faith alone, that is, in faith separated from good works. But I can testify that those who so believe and at the same time so live all come into hell. But those who live according to the precepts contained in the exhortation preparatory to the Holy Supper, and according to what has just been quoted from the Athanasian faith, come into heaven. Moreover, these have faith; but the others do not, whatever they may think to the contrary. It is said, those who believe and at the same time live from doctrine; for there are many, especially the more simple-minded, who believe from doctrine, but who do not at the same time live according to the doctrine; and these are saved. [5] It is the same in the Lutheran Church. There, too, those who teach from doctrine and those who teach from the Word go in opposite directions. Those who teach from doctrine teach in precisely the same way as in the Anglican Church respecting faith alone and justification by it; and they separate works from the means of salvation, and set them aside as not good and as meritorious, and thus not justifying, because they are from man. But when they teach from the Word they also teach works, as can be seen from things written that are set forth for the general body, and are therefore inserted in all the Psalm books, and are called “Hindrances to the Impenitent,”10 where the following words occur: “The holy will of God and His manifest command is, that those who believe should perform good works, and when these are done for just causes, and aim at a true end, especially such as are done for the sake of God’s glory and the use of the neighbor, they are acceptable to God for Christ’s sake; yea, out of pure mercy He rewards them; so that man has recompense for every good that he does. For God gives praise and honor and eternal blessedness to those who in patience strive through works to attain to eternal life."

And on this account the apostle Paul uses these admonitions to exhort his hearers to good works, saying, `Let us not be weary in well-doing, for in due season we shall reap it without ceasing’ (Gal. 6:9). Therefore those who are rich in good works show thereby that they are rich in faith, since while faith is living it works by charity. Yea, faith which alone justifies never abides alone and separate, but brings with it good works, as a good tree does good fruit, the sun light, the fire heat, and the water moisture.” From all this it can be seen that in those churches the teaching from doctrine and thus from the Word is one thing, and the teaching from the Word and not at the same time from doctrine is another thing; and that those who teach and at the same time live from doctrine are meant by those who “adore the beast and his image” (here treated of in verses 9–11); and that those who teach and live from the Word are meant by those of whom it is said in the twelfth verse, “Here is the patience of the saints; here are they that keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.” 886. And hath received the mark on his forehead or on his hand, signifies acceptance and acknowledgment of these as goods of the church or as truths of the church. This is evident from the explanations above (n. 838), where like words occur. “To receive the mark on the forehead” signifies to love these things and thus acknowledge them as goods of the church, for “the forehead” signifies the good of love (see above, n. 427), here to acknowledge evils as goods; and “to receive the mark on the hand” signifies to acknowledge the falsities of that faith as truths of the church, for the “hands” are predicated of truths (see above, n. 298). This makes clear that “to receive the mark on the forehead or on the hand” signifies to accept by acknowledgment the evils of the doctrine of faith alone as goods of the church, and its falsities as truths of the church. It is said, “as goods of the church or as truths of the church,” because there are those who love that faith that is signified by the “beast,” and there are those who acknowledge that faith as the truth of the church; these are the simple-minded who accept that faith, but the former are the learned who glory in their"

The same is true of those who live for the world and for their own gratification, and yet think at times about eternal life; for these confirm their life by that faith. 887. Verse 10. Even he shall drink of the wine of the anger of God mixed with unmixed wine in the cup of His wrath, signifies appropriation of falsity and its evil, conjoined with falsified truths from the sense of the letter of the Word. This is evident from the signification of “to drink,” as being to take in and to appropriate to oneself (see above, n. 617a, c-e); also from the signification of “wine,” as being truth from good, and in the contrary sense falsity from evil (see above, n. 376); also from the signification of “anger,” as being evil, because evil is angry against good and wishes to destroy it (see n. 693, 754). It is said “the anger of God,” but anger against God is meant, as in many passages where anger and wrath and evil in general are attributed to God (see n. 481 at the end, n. 647); so here, “to drink the wine of the anger of God” signifies to take in and appropriate falsity and its evil. The taking in and appropriation of evil is effected by faith separated from good works, because when goods of life, which are good works, are set aside as not justifying, thus as not saving, evils take their place; for so far as goods withdraw evils enter, “for no one can serve two masters,” namely, evil and good, at the same time. The above is evident also from the signification of “mixed with unmixed wine,” as being to be conjoined with falsified truths (of which presently); also from the signification of “cup,” as being an external container of truth, thus the Word in the sense of its letter; for when “wine” signifies truth, “cup” signifies that which contains it, and the sense of the letter of the Word is the container of truth, both natural and spiritual. (That “cup” has a similar signification as “wine,” that is, what it contains, and that it signifies the container, can be seen from the passages in the Word where “cup,” “chalice,” “goblet,” and “vial” are mentioned, which will be cited in the explanation of chapters 16 and 17 that follows.) As “cup” signifies the external or container of truth, thus the sense of the letter of the Word, and as this is falsified by those who are in the doctrine and at the same time in the life of faith separated, so it is called “the cup of God’s"

All this makes clear that “the wine mixed with unmixed wine in the cup of the wrath of God” signifies conjunction with falsified truths from the sense of the letter of the Word. [2] “To mix with unmixed wine” signifies to be conjoined with falsified truths of the Word, because “unmixed wine” means intoxicating wine, and thus intoxication, consequently in the spiritual sense delirium in respect to truths induced by falsities, for delirium in respect to truths induced by falsities is spiritual intoxication. Moreover, the word in the original translated “unmixed wine” is derived from a word that means to be intoxicated. As this is the signification of “unmixed wine,” and those who falsify the Word are spiritually drunken, that is, are in a state of delirium in respect to truths, the two passages where “unmixed wine” is mentioned in the Word treat of the falsification of truth, as in Isaiah and Hosea. [3] In Isaiah: How hath the faithful city become a harlot; she was full of judgment, justice lodged in her; but now murderers. Thy silver hath become dross, thy unmixed wine mixed with waters (1:21, 22). A “harlot” signifies everywhere in the Word falsified truth (see above, n. 141, 161); and “city” signifies doctrine; so “the faithful city becoming a harlot” signifies that doctrine that had previously been the doctrine of genuine truth has become the doctrine of falsified truth. “She was full of judgment, justice lodged in her,” signifies where the truth of doctrine and the good of love had been abundant, for “judgment” is predicated in the Word of the truth of doctrine and the understanding, and “justice” of the good of love and of the will; “but now murderers” signifies that falsification has extinguished the understanding of truth and the perception of good. (That this is the signification of a “murderer” may be seen above, n. 589.) “Thy silver hath become dross” signifies that"

[4] In Hosea: Ephraim is associated with idols, let him alone. Their wine11 is gone; in whoring they have committed whoredom, they are given up to love (4:17, 18). “Ephraim” signifies the understanding of the truth of the church, “idols” signify the falsities of religion. This makes clear what is signified by “Ephraim is associated with idols.” “Let him alone” signifies the rejection of the falsities of that religion by the church. “Their wine12 is gone” signifies that the truth of the Word has perished; “in whoring they have committed whoredom” signifies the falsification of that truth; “they are given up to love” signifies the love of falsity. All this makes clear what is signified in particular by “unmixed wine.” 888. And he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone before the holy angels and before the lamb, signifies that their hell is from the love of evil and falsity, that is direful according to the falsification and consequent destruction of Divine truth and Divine good, thus of the Word. This is evident from the signification of “to be tormented,” as being hell; for when heaven is mentioned its joy is at the same time meant, so when hell is mentioned its torment is also meant, and conversely; this is especially true of this expression “to be tormented with fire and brimstone.” The above is evident also from the signification of “fire,” as being love in both senses, namely, love to the Lord and love towards the neighbor, which are the loves that prevail in heaven, and in the contrary sense love of self and love of the world, which are the loves that prevail in hell (see above, n. 504). And as all goods have their source in love to the Lord and love towards the neighbor, and all evils have their origin through love of self and love of the world, so “fire” signifies the love of all things of good, and in the contrary sense the love of all things of evil. Also from the signification of “brimstone,” as being the love of falsity from evil, especially the lust of destroying the truths of the good of the church by the falsities of evil (see n. 578)."

[2] “To be tormented before the holy angels and before the Lamb” signifies the direfulness of hell according to the falsification and consequent destruction of the Divine truth and the Divine good, thus of the Word, because the direfulness of hell, or the torment there is altogether according to that falsification and destruction; for so far as a man falsifies the Word so far he closes heaven to himself, and so far as he destroys interior Divine truths, which are Divine truths in the heavens, and from which the heavens exist, so far he is separated from the heavens and is cast down the more deeply into hell. This is “to be tormented before the angels and before the Lamb,” because the Word in the letter communicates with heaven through the spiritual sense; consequently so far as that sense is destroyed by falsification so far is the falsifier cast out of heaven, and so far as anyone is cast out of heaven so far he is tormented. That this is the spiritual sense of these words can be seen from the fact that no one is tormented in hell by angels or by the Lord, thus neither before the angels nor before the Lord, but by himself through the falsification and consequent destruction of the Divine truth, which is signified by “the holy angels,” and of the Divine good, which is signified by “the Lamb.” [3] How infernal and thus how injurious it is to falsify the Word even to the destruction of the Divine truth and the Divine good in the heavens can be seen from the fact that all things of the sense of the letter of the Word, which are Divine truths for the natural man, communicate through the spiritual sense with the angels of heaven, to the extent that men and the angels of heaven are conjoined by means of the Word; conse quently the sense of the letter of the Word, with the man who falsifies it, is perceived in heaven in a two-fold manner, namely as genuine truth and also as"

From this it comes that truth and falsity are presented together as conjoined, from which the angels of heaven are exasperated, and turn themselves entirely away. Thus heaven is closed up, and all communication of heaven with that man is destroyed; consequently he comes into conjunction with hell. And so far as anyone is conjoined with hell so far he is in the love of all evil and its falsity, and from that in a lust of destroying the truths and goods of the church, and at the same time he is in torment. This, then, is what is signified by “being tormented with fire and brimstone before the holy angels and before the Lamb.” [4] This is true especially of those who think from faith alone and at the same time live from faith alone, that is, who confirm that faith in themselves both in doctrine and life, as is done especially by those who have studied much to confirm that faith by writings and preachings. Such cannot do otherwise than falsify the Word, even to the destruction of its genuine truth; for the Word in the whole complex has respect to man’s life, consequently to works; for the Lord says that the law and the prophets hang upon these two commandments, namely, to love God above all things and the neighbor as oneself. “The law and the prophets” signify the Word in the whole complex; and “to love God and the neighbor” means doing the commandments, and this is works (see above, n. 826), and works are what the defenders of faith separated shut out; and as a consequence they reject all the essentials of the Word when they read it; and when the essentials are rejected all that remains is dross, just as an animal’s body when its life is taken away becomes putrid, since its love, which is the same as deeds, is its life. I have heard spirits who, when they lived as men in the world, had embraced faith alone, talking about the Word, that it contained Divine truths in abundance, and they said, “What are the knowledges of good and truth to me? What advantage is it to know anything about regeneration, remission of sins, free will, providence, love and charity, good works, and the rest, when the trust and confidence of this faith alone—that the Lord died for our sins—is the only thing that saves, and when all things of the Word must be explained to prove this, and can be so explained?

Verse 11. And the smoke of their torment shall go up unto the ages of the ages, signifies the dense falsity encompassing them and continually flowing forth from their loves. This is evident from the signification of “smoke,” as being dense falsity flowing forth out of the hells from the evils of earthly and bodily loves with those who are there (see above, n. 539); also from the signification of “torment,” as being the direfulness of hell, thus hell itself (see above, n. 888); also from the signification of “going up,” as being to encompass and flow forth (of which presently); also from the signification of “unto the ages of the ages,” as being continuously. Strictly, “the ages of the ages” signifies what is eternal or without end; but in the spiritual sense, which is apart from the idea of time, it signifies a state interiorly ruling without ceasing. This makes clear that “the smoke of their torment shall go up unto the ages of the ages” signifies the dense falsity encompassing them and flowing forth from their loves continually. [2] That dense falsity encompasses and flows forth from them, follows from the fact that everyone is his own truth or his own falsity, because he is his own love. For everything that a man thinks inwardly or in his spirit is from his love; and everything that a man thinks has reference either to truths or to falsities; consequently man is either his own truth or his own falsity; and, what is yet unknown, man is his own truth or his own falsity not only as to the thoughts that are from his will but also as to his whole body; for the body with all its organs, viscera, and members, is the field into which the thoughts from the will go forth and spread themselves abroad, thence the entire man, as to everything pertaining to him both interior and exterior, is his own love, and thus his own truth or his own falsity (see further above, n. 775, 837).

But these exhalations are natural exhalations. It is the same in the spiritual world, where from every spirit and angel the sphere of his love, and thus the sphere of his truth or falsity, flows forth in every direction; and in consequence the quality of all spirits can be known solely by the spiritual sphere that pours forth from them, and according to these spheres they have conjunction with societies that have a like love, and thus a like truth or falsity; those who are in the love of good and of truth therefrom are with the societies of heaven, while those who are in the love of evil and of falsity therefrom are with the societies of hell. [4] I can assert that no spirit or man has a single thought that does not communicate through that sphere with some society. That this is so has not hitherto been known to man, but it has been made evident to me by a thousand experiences in the spiritual world; and therefore when the quality of spirits is explored, the direction in which their thoughts pour forth is investigated, and from this it is known with what societies they are conjoined, and thus what they are, and that the evil are with societies of hell and the good with societies of heaven. From this, too, it has been made clear to me that as the eye, according to its determinations, takes the quality of its sight from the objects in the natural world, so the understanding, according to its determinations, takes the quality of its thought from the truths that are its objects in the spiritual world; and thus man has not the least thought from himself, but it is either from hell or from heaven, and his thought is according to the determination of the affections that are of his love; in this determination his freedom has its seat.

From which it is clear why “smoke” in the Word signifies falsities from evils. 890. And they shall have no rest day and night, signifies continual infestation by evils and falsities thence. This is evident from the signification of “having no rest,” as being to be infested by evils and falsities thence (of which presently); also from the signification of “day and night,” as being continuously. For “day and night” does not mean day and night, but their state, here in reference to infestation; for in the spiritual world no one has any idea of time, but an idea of state, as has been frequently said and shown above; and “day” signifies the state of their falsity, and “night” the state of their evil; for it is in reference to thought that man is in light, thus in day, and in reference to affection that he is in obscurity, that is, in night; moreover, falsities and truths pertain to thought, and evils and goods to affection. This is why there was a cloud over the tent by day, and a fire by night, “cloud” with the sons of Israel signifying the truth and “fire” the good of love with them. [2] Infestation by evils and falsities is signified by “having no rest,” because those who are in hell are continually withheld from their loves, and as often as they break out into them they are punished; for their loves are hatreds, revenges, enmities, and lusts of doing evil, which are so delightful to them that they may be called the very delights of their life, consequently to be withheld from them is to be tormented. For everyone is in the joy of his heart when he is in his ruling love; and thus conversely, is in grief of heart when he is withheld from it. This is the general torment of hell, from which innumerable others exist; but to enumerate and describe them does not belong to this work or place."

[2] The persecutions of those who are in charity by those who are in faith separated from charity are not such at this day as cause them to be banished and cast out from the assemblages of the Christian world, but only to be reviled and condemned by those who are in faith alone. For no one can be banished and cast out in any kingdom who lives well, and who declares that to live well is necessary to salvation, since this is in complete agreement with the Word, and since everyone sees from rational light that he ought to live well; and yet such are condemned by those who are in faith alone as not saved because of merit in good works, and because such works are not good because they are from self, and for other reasons by which they confirm justification and salvation by faith alone. This is more evident with those who belong to the Moravian sect, who above all others are defenders of faith separated, and who condemn those who in their life give thought to doing good from religion as not being alive but utterly dead, and declare that all such are cast out of heaven. Those who do not belong to that sect, but to churches where works are rejected as means of salvation, do not thus blaspheme although they think wrongly about such, especially those who confirm themselves in many ways by writings or by preachings or by reasonings in the doctrine of justification by faith alone. These persecutions are what are here meant by “patience,” and also in chapter 12 of Revelation by: The dragon standing before the woman who was about to bring forth, that when she brought forth he might devour her offspring; and afterwards he persecuted the woman, and cast out after her, out of his mouth, water as a river, that he might cause her to be swallowed up by the river; also the dragon was angry against the woman, and went away to make war with the remnant of her seed who keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ (verses 4, 15, 17).

These falsities and evils are removed by the combats of temptations. This is what is meant by the “cross” in the following passages: Jesus said, He that doth not take up his cross and follow after Me is not worthy of Me (Matt. 10:38; Luke 14:27). Jesus said to His disciples, If anyone will come after Me let him deny himself, take up his cross, and follow Me (Matt. 16:24; Mark 8:34; Luke 9:23). In these passages the “cross” means temptations, and “to follow the Lord” means to acknowledge His Divine and to do His commandments. That this is the meaning of “following the Lord” may be seen above (n. 864). The “cross” means temptations because the evils and the falsities therefrom that cling to man from his birth infest and thus torment those who are natural when they are becoming spiritual. And as those evils and their falsities that infest and torment can be dispersed only by temptations, temptations are signified by the “cross.” Therefore the Lord says, that “they must deny themselves and take up their cross,” that is, that they must reject what is their own, “their cross” meaning what is man’s own (proprium), against which he must fight. [4] Again: Jesus spake to the rich man who asked Him what he should do to inherit eternal life. Jesus said to him, Thou knowest the commandments: Thou shalt not commit adultery; Thou shalt not kill; Thou shalt not steal; Thou shalt not bear false witness; Thou shalt not defraud; Honor thy father and mother. He answered and said unto Him, All these things have I observed from my youth. Jesus looked upon him and loved him; yet He said unto him, One thing thou lackest; go, sell whatsoever thou hast and give to the poor; so shalt thou have treasure in the heavens; and come, follow Me, taking up the cross (Mark 10:17–21)."

And yet before anyone can act from the Lord he must undergo temptations, for the reason that the internal of man, by which he is conjoined with heaven, is opened by means of temptations. And because no one can do the commandments apart from the Lord, therefore the Lord said, “Yet one thing thou lackest; sell all that thou hast and follow Me, taking up the cross”; that is, the Lord must be acknowledged and temptations must be endured. That “he should sell all that he had and give to the poor” signifies in the spiritual sense that he should alienate and cast away from himself what is his own, thus it has the same signification as “denying oneself” in the passages quoted above; and “to give to the poor” signifies in the spiritual sense to do the works of charity. The Lord said this to him because he was rich; and “riches” signify in the spiritual sense the knowledges of good and truth, and with this man, who was a Jew, the knowledges of evil and falsity, since they were traditions. From this it can be seen that the Lord, here as elsewhere, spake by correspondences. [5] Again, temptations are signified by the “cup” of which they were to drink: Jesus said unto James and John, Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink the cup that I drink, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? They said unto Him, We are able. And Jesus said to them, The cup that I drink ye shall indeed drink, and with the baptism that I am baptized with shall ye be baptized; but to sit on My right hand or on My left is not Mine to give, but for whom it hath been prepared (Mark 10:38–40). “To drink the cup that the Lord drank” has the same signification that the “cross” has above, namely, to undergo temptations; and “the baptism with which the Lord was baptized” signifies to be regenerated by temptations.

The temptations of the Lord were most grievous, and against all the hells; for the Lord subjugated all the hells by means of the temptations admitted into Himself; but the temptations of men are against evils and falsities that are from the hells with them, and in these the Lord and not man himself fights, except against certain painful feelings. There is a like difference between the baptism with which the Lord was baptized and the baptism with which men are baptized as there is between glorification and regeneration. By means of temptations the Lord glorified His Human by His own power, but men are regenerated, not by their own power but by the Lord; for “baptism” signifies to be regenerated by temptations, but the Lord’s baptism signifies the glorification of His Human by temptations. (That “baptism” signifies regeneration and also temptations may be seen in the New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine, n. 187–193 seq.; and that the Lord glorified His Human and made it Divine, as He regenerates man and makes him spiritual, may be seen in the Arcana Coelestia, n. 1725, 1729, 1733, 3318, 3381, 3382, 4286.) 894.

It is said in many passages in the Word that “they should keep and do God’s commandments and His precepts”; and “to do the precepts of God” means the same as to love the Lord above all things, and the neighbor as oneself. For what a man loves inwardly or from the heart he wills, and what he wills he does; and to love God is to love His precepts, because they are of God even to the extent that they are God. From this it can be seen how little the followers of faith alone know what love is. They grant or affirm that faith lives from love, and that faith without love is dead, and yet they do not know that love and deeds are one. They declare that love is in faith; and yet they do not know there is no love in faith when one does not live according to the Lord’s commandments in the Word; and that it is from this, and from no other source whatever, that there is any love in faith except a natural love that is not love to the Lord and love to the neighbor, but love of self and love of the world; and"

It is to be known that truth and faith in their essence are one, since faith must be of truth and truth must be of faith; consequently the men of old time did not speak of faith, but of truth instead of faith, while the men of the present day speak of faith instead of truth, and for the reason that the men of old time declared that nothing was to be believed except what they saw to be true, thus what they comprehended by the understanding. But the men of the present day declare that a thing must be believed even when they do not see it or comprehend it by the understanding. This makes clear how the old faith differed from the present faith, namely, as what is seen differs from what is not seen; but the very truth itself that is seen or comprehended by the understanding is not to be named faith, but only that which is not seen or not comprehended by the understanding. For this reason the angels in the higher heavens are unwilling even to mention faith, for they see truth from the love of good and the light of truth which are in them from the Lord; and they say that it is folly to have faith in anyone’s saying that this or that must be believed when it is not comprehended by the understanding, for this would be to think a thing to be true whether it be true or false, and to believe what is false is hurtful. Moreover, what is believed and not seen enters into man no further than the memory, and this cannot be appropriated to him. [2] From this it follows that it would be better to give up the use of the term “faith” and to use the expression “the truth” in its stead. And yet what is believed and is not seen may be called faith, although such a faith is mere knowledge (scientia). But as soon as a man becomes spiritual (and he becomes so when his internal which communicates with heaven is opened), then that which is known,"

It is to be known that all angels and all good spirits see the truths of heaven as the bodily eye sees the objects of the world, for the objects of heaven are truths to those who are spiritual, for the reason that their understanding is their spiritual sight. The term truth should be used in place of faith, because all intelligence and all wisdom exists by means of truths, while all ignorance, that is, in spiritual things, exists by means of faith, especially faith separated; consequently the angels of the higher heavens turn themselves away when they hear faith mentioned, because their mind is turned away from what is thought by them; which thought is that the understanding should be held captive in obedience to faith; also because not to see truths would be to extinguish the light of heaven, in which those angels are and which is in them. Moreover, they are surprised that some believe that the faith that understands is not spiritual faith, when in fact such faith is truth; while a faith that is destitute of understanding is historical faith, because it is from another, and this regarded in itself is mere knowledge (scientia). 896.

For angels, like men, cannot think any truth from themselves nor do good from themselves, but only from the Lord; and this is why “angels” signify in the Word Divine truths from the Lord, and “heaven” signifies the Lord. Those are greatly mistaken who believe that angels were created immediately, and in such a state of integrity that they could do good from themselves; for all angels throughout the entire heaven have been men, and therefore they have what is their own, the same as men have, and this is wholly evil. But while they lived in the world as men they were regenerated by the Lord, and thus could be withheld from evils and their falsities and be held in goods; and when they are withheld from evils and held in goods by the Lord it seems as if they are in goods from themselves, and yet they know and perceive that this they have from the Lord and not from themselves. From all this it can be seen why the whole angelic heaven, as to intelligence and wisdom and as to the affections of good and truth, is the Lord. And this is why “a voice saying from heaven” signifies such things as are from the Lord, and here consolations after temptations, and this because the preceding verse treats of the patience of those “who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus,” and “patience” here signifies temptations. [2] Something shall now be said about consolations after temptations. All who are being regenerated by the Lord undergo temptations, and after temptations experience joys. But the source of the temptations and of the joys that follow, which are here meant by consolations, is not yet known in the world, because there are few who experience spiritual temptations, for the reason that there are few who are in the knowledges of good and truth, and fewer yet who are in the marriage of good and truth, that is, in truths as to doctrine and at the same time in goods as to life; and no others are let into spiritual temptations; for if others were let into temptations they would yield, and if they yielded their latter state would be worse than their former state.

This is why man is distressed in temptations by the evils and falsities that rise up into the thought; and so far as he then acknowledges his sins, regards himself as guilty, and prays for deliverance, so far the temptations are useful to him. From this it is clear that man has spiritual temptation, when his internal, which is called the spiritual mind, is opened, thus when man is being regenerated. When, therefore, man’s evils and falsities are removed temptations are brought to an end; and when they are ended joy flows in through heaven from the Lord and fills his natural mind. This joy is what is here meant by consolations. These consolations all those receive who undergo spiritual temptations. I speak from experience. After temptations man receives joys because after them man is admitted into heaven; for through temptations man is conjoined to heaven and is admitted into it, and consequently has joy like that of the angels there. 898. Write, signifies certainty. This is evident from the signification of “writing,” as being certainty; for that which is said from heaven, and is commanded to be written, is like what has been endorsed, and thus is true, and consequently certain; here it means that those who endure spiritual temptations shall have consolations and be happy. “To write” signifies certainty because writing is the ultimate act of thought and of speech therefrom, and thus it means what is certain, because what is terminated. This may be compared with all things that a man wills, thinks, and speaks therefrom, and does not terminate by doing them; such things are not yet in man’s life, for the ultimate in which prior things exist together is lacking. That “writing” thus signifies to inscribe on the life may be seen above (n. 222)."

This is evident from the signification of “the dead in the Lord,” as being those who rise into eternal life (of which presently), also from the signification of “the dead and those that die from henceforth,” as being the resurrection of those who have heretofore lived and who henceforth live a life of charity, for this is said of those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus; and these are such as live according to the Lord’s commandments in the Word and acknowledge His Divine, thus who live a life of charity from the Lord (see above, n. 894, 895). [2] It is said “from henceforth,” because those are meant who have heretofore lived and who henceforth live that life. Those who have lived that life heretofore were kept by the Lord below the heavens and protected from infestation by the hells until the last judgment; and when this was accomplished they were raised up from their places, and elevated into heaven. This was not done before because before that the hells prevailed, and there was a preponderance on their part; but after this the heavens prevailed, and thus there was a preponderance on their part; for by the last judgment all things, both in the hells and in the heavens, were reduced to order. If, therefore, these had been elevated before, they could not have resisted the power with which the hells prevailed over the heavens. That they were elevated it was granted me to see; for I saw troops of them arising and being lifted up from the lower earth, where they had been kept by the Lord, and transferred to the heavenly societies. This took place after that last judgment that is treated of in the work on the Last Judgment. The same was done after a former judgment that was accomplished by the Lord when He was in the world, which is treated of in the same work. This mystery is what is meant by the resurrection of those who had heretofore lived a life of charity. This is meant also by these words in John: Now is the judgment of this world; now shall the prince of this world be cast out.

But on this more will be said where the first and second resurrection or death are treated of in what follows in Revelation. [3] “The dead that are blessed,” and “those that die,” mean also those that are to rise again into life hereafter, who are such as live a life of charity, as is evident from the expressions “from henceforth,” and “the dead,” and “those that die,” “from henceforth,” referring not only to those who are such since the last judgment, but also to those who were such before, and who have been treated of above. “Death” signifies resurrection, and thus “the dead” signify those who rise again into eternal life, because “death” signifies hell, and thus evils and falsities; and these must die that man may receive spiritual life; for until these are dead and extinct man has no spiritual life, which is the life that is meant in the Word by “life,” “eternal life,” and “resurrection”; therefore “to die” means here and elsewhere in the Word the extinction of the life that is man’s own, which regarded in itself consists solely of evils and falsities from them. And because when that life has been extinguished spiritual life enters in its place, so “the dead in the Lord” signify those who have been made spiritual by the Lord. [4] Moreover, “to die” can mean in the spiritual sense resurrection, because the angels, who are in the spiritual sense of the Word, know nothing about natural death, by which man is taken out of this world; but they know only about spiritual death, which comes to those who are being regenerated by the Lord by means of temptations, and with whom evils and falsities therefrom are being subdued and put to death. Again, natural death is nothing but resurrection, for the reason that when the body dies man rises again as to his spirit, and thus death is simply a continuation of his life; for through death man passes from a life in the natural world into a life in the spiritual world, with the difference only that the life in the natural world is a more external and imperfect life, and the life in the spiritual world is a more"

[5] From all this it can be seen that “death” signifies both spiritual death, which is damnation, and resurrection into life, which is salvation. That “death” signifies damnation can be seen above (n. 186, 383, 427a, 694). That “death” signifies resurrection to eternal life, and salvation, can be seen from the following passages. In John: Jesus said, I am the resurrection and the life; he that believeth in Me, though he die yet shall he live; and everyone that liveth shall not die forever (11:25, 26). “I am the resurrection and the life” signifies that resurrection and life are from Him and not from another; “he that believeth in Me” signifies he that believes in the Lord’s Divine and believes that He is the omnipotent and only God; and as no one can believe this except he that lives a life of charity, therefore a life of charity is also meant by “believing in Him”; “though he die yet shall he live” signifies that though one die naturally, still he shall rise again into life; “and everyone that liveth and believeth in Me shall not die forever” signifies that he who has been reformed shall not die spiritually, that is, be condemned, but shall rise again into eternal life. This makes clear that “to die” does not mean to die, but to rise again to life. [6] In the same: Your fathers did eat manna in the desert, and they are dead. This is the bread which cometh down out of heaven, that one may eat thereof and not die (John 6:49, 50, 58). The “manna” that the sons of Jacob ate in the desert means in reference to them natural food, because they were natural; but “the bread that cometh down out of heaven” means spiritual food, which is from the Lord alone; and because it is from Him alone, in the highest sense “bread” means Himself; and therefore He says, “I am the Bread of life.” For Divine good united with Divine truth"

[7] In the same: If a man keep My word he shall never see death (John 7:51, 52). “To keep the Lord’s words” signifies to live according to the Lord’s commandments; “not to see death” signifies not to see condemnation but life, into which man rises and enters by death. In the same: Jesus said, Verily I say unto you, that he that heareth My word and believeth on Him that sent Me hath eternal life, and cometh not into judgment but passeth from death into life (John 5:24). “To hear the word of the Lord and believe on Him that sent Him” has a like meaning as above, for by “the Father” the Lord meant the Divine that was in Him from conception, thus Himself. “Not to come into judgment” signifies not to be condemned; “to pass from death into life” signifies resurrection and life in heaven, “from death” signifying not only from natural death into eternal life, thus a resurrection, but also from spiritual death, which is condemnation, into eternal life; thus also resurrection; for the Word contains both a natural and a spiritual sense. [8] In the same: Jesus said, As the Father raiseth up the dead and vivifieth them, even so the Son vivifieth whom He will (John 5:21). “To raise up the dead and vivify them” means resurrection into life, not only by natural death but also by spiritual death; resurrection"

These places are signified in the spiritual sense by “tombs.” This does not mean that the tombs in the earth are to be opened, and that they shall come forth from them at the day of the last judgment, as is clearly evident from the fact that all men come into the spiritual world immediately after death, and live"

This took place and was seen by those who were in Jerusalem; nevertheless it was representative of the resurrection of those here and before described.

[2] “Labors” mean temptations, because temptations are labors of the soul or spiritual labors; and these are meant by “labor” in Isaiah: Jehovah hath willed to bruise him, He hath weakened him; if He hath made his soul a guilt offering, he shall see seed, he shall prolong days, and the will of Jehovah shall prosper by his hand; he shall see of the labor of his soul and shall be satisfied (53;10, 11). This is said of the Lord, of whom the whole of that chapter treats. The Lord’s temptations, which were most grievous, because they were against the hells, are described by “Jehovah willed to bruise him, He hath weakened him,” for by means of temptations the loves of what is one’s own are broken, thus the body is bruised and weakened. “If he hath made his soul a guilt offering” signifies, if he has endured temptations even unto death; “he shall see seed” signifies that the Divine truth shall proceed from Him, “seed” meaning truth, and in reference to the Lord the Divine truth; “he shall prolong days” signifies the Divine good, which shall also proceed from Him, “long” and thus “to prolong” being said in reference to good (see above, n. 629a), and “days” signifying states. “And the will of Jehovah shall prosper by his hand” signifies that thus all things and each thing in the heavens and in the earths shall be kept in Divine order; “of the labor of his soul” signifies by temptations; “he shall see and shall be satisfied” signifies glorification. This is the signification of these words in the highest sense, which treats of the Lord. But in a relative sense they describe the salvation of the human race, for which the Lord fought from Divine love.

The arcanum that is concealed in these words no one can see unless he knows what the temptations are by which man is regenerated. For in these man is kept in his freedom; from which it appears to him as if he fought from himself. In fact, man has in temptations a more potent spiritual freedom than when he is not in them, for it is more interior. Unless man fought from this freedom in temptations he could not become spiritual; for all freedom is of the love, therefore man then fights from the love of truth, and thus from the love of eternal life; and in this and in no other way is the internal opened and man regenerated. From these few things it can be seen in some degree what is involved in these words of the Lord, namely, that he fought from His own freedom and finally laid down His soul that He might do all things from His own power, and thus might become righteousness from Himself, which He could not have become except from His freedom; and this is why it is said, “I lay down My soul of Myself; I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment I have received from My Father.” [4] Those to whom this arcanum is unknown interpret these words as the Arians do, that the Lord was the adopted not the actual Son of God; thus that He was adopted because He was willing to lay down His life, or endure the death of the cross; not knowing that these words involve that from His own power He fought against the hells from His Human and overcame them, and from His own power He glorified His Human, that is, united it to the very Divine in Himself, and thus made it Divine; and that this could by no means have been done if absolute freedom had not been left to Him as to the Human. All this makes clear why it is said in Isaiah, “If He hath made his soul a guilt offering.” (That freedom is that which is of the love and of the will and thus of the life of man, and that it appears as if it were his own, can be seen in the New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine, n. 141, 145.

This is evident from the signification of “works,” as being spiritual life, such as the angels of heaven have (of which presently); also from the signification of “to follow with them,” as meaning to be in them, for what follows with anyone, when it is predicated of his life, is in him, and is as it were himself; therefore it is said “to follow with them,” not follow them. “Works” signify the life of man because they constitute his life. For man has thought, will, and from these two, action. That which is in a man’s thought and not in his will is not yet in him. That which is in thought and in the will, and not in act, this indeed enters the man, and forms a beginning to his life; and yet it goes forth and disappears, because it has not been terminated. But that which is in a man’s will, and from that in act, constitutes his life, and remains, whether it be evil or good. That thought alone does not constitute man’s life can be seen from this, that man is able to think many things that he does"

The thought and the will of man without the act do not constitute his life, because the will is not made sure, and a will not made sure is like water passing off into vapor, since it is easily changed by a love opposed to it. From all this it can be seen that by works which are acts of the will man’s life is signified. That works, love, will, and act, also man’s life, make one, may be seen above (n. 842). 902. Since here as in many other passages in Revelation, “works” are mentioned, and here it is said that “their works do follow with them,” which signifies spiritual life, something shall be said about how that life is acquired, and also how it is destroyed by the faith of the present day. Spiritual life is acquired solely by a life according to the commandments in the Word. These commandments are given in a summary in the Decalog, namely, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet the goods of others. These commandments are the commandments that are to be done, for when a man does these his works are good and his life becomes spiritual, because so far as a man shuns evils and hates them, so far he wills and loves goods. [2] For there are two opposite spheres that surround man, one from hell, the other from heaven, from hell a sphere of evil and of falsity therefrom, from heaven a sphere of good and of truth therefrom; and these spheres do not affect15 the body, but they affect the minds of men, for they are spiritual spheres, and thus are affections that belong to the love. Man is set in the midst of these; therefore so far as he approaches the one so far he withdraws from the other. This is why so far as a man shuns evils and hates them, so far he wills and loves goods and the truths therefrom, for: No one can at the same time serve two masters, for he will either hate the one and love the other (Matt. 6:24). [3] But let it be known, that man must do these commandments from religion, because they are commanded by the Lord; and if he does them from any other consideration whatever, for instance, from regard merely to the civil law or the moral law, he remains natural, and does not become spiritual. For when a man acts from"

But when he acts merely from the civil and moral law, he may act in the same way, and yet in heart may deny that there is a God, a heaven and a hell, and a life after death. And if he shuns evils and does goods it is only in an external form, and not in an internal form; thus while he is outwardly as to the life of the body like a Christian, inwardly as to the life of his spirit he is like a devil. All this makes clear that a man can become spiritual, or receive spiritual life, in no other way than by a life according to religion from the Lord. [4] I have had proof that this is true from angels of the third or inmost heaven, who are in the greatest wisdom and happiness. When asked how they had become such angels, they said that it was because during their life in the world they had regarded filthy thoughts as heinous, and these had been to them adulteries; and had regarded in like manner frauds and unlawful gains, which had been to them thefts; also hatreds and revenges, which had been to them murder; also lies and blasphemies, which had been to them false testimonies: and so with other things. When asked again whether they had done good works, they said that they loved chastity, in which they were because they had regarded adulteries as heinous; that they loved sincer ity and justice, in which they were because they had regarded frauds and unlawful gains as heinous; that they loved the neighbor because they had regarded hatreds and revenges as heinous; that they loved truth because they had regarded lies and blasphemies as heinous, and so on; and that they perceived that when these evils had been put away, and they acted from chastity, sincerity, justice, charity, and truth, it was not done from themselves but from the Lord, and thus that all things whatsoever that they had done from these were good works, although they had done them as if from themselves; and that it was on this account that they had been raised up by the Lord after death into the third heaven. Thus it was made clear how spiritual life, which is the life of the angels of heaven, is acquired. [5] It shall now be told how that life is destroyed by the faith of the present day. The faith of this day is that it must be believed that God the Father sent His Son, who suffered the cross for our sins,"

By this faith, instilled from childhood and afterwards confirmed by preachings, it has come to pass that no one shuns evils from religion, but only from the civil and moral law; thus not because they are sins but because they are damaging. Consider, when a man thinks that the Lord suffered for our sins, that He took away the condemnation of the law, and that merely to believe these things or to have faith in them without good works saves—whether this is not to regard as of little worth all the commandments of the Decalog, all the life of religion as prescribed in the Word, and furthermore all the truths that teach charity. Separate these therefore, and take them away from man, and is there any religion left in him? For religion does not consist in merely thinking this or that, but in willing and doing that which is thought; and there is no religion when willing and doing are separated from thinking. From this it follows that the faith of this day destroys spiritual life, which is the life of the angels of heaven, and is the Christian life itself. [6] Consider further, why the ten commandments of the Decalog were promulgated from Mount Sinai by so great a miracle; why they were engraven on two tables of stone, and why these were placed in the ark, over which was placed the mercy-seat with cherubs, and the place where those commandments were was called the Holy of holies, within which Aaron was permitted to enter only once a year, and this with sacrifices and incense, and if he had entered without these he would have fallen dead; also why so many miracles were afterwards performed by the ark. Have not all throughout the whole globe a knowledge of like commandments? Do not their civil laws prescribe the same? Who does not know from merely natural lumen, that for the sake of order in every kingdom adultery, theft, murder, false witness, and other things in the Decalog are forbidden? Why then were those same precepts promulgated by so many miracles, and regarded as so holy? Can there be any other reason than that everyone might do them from religion, and thus from God, and not merely from civil and moral law, and thus from self and for the sake of the world? This was the reason for their promulgation from Mount Sinai and their holiness;"

[7] Inquire now whether the faith of this day does not cancel all these commandments, which faith is, that the Lord suffered for our sins, that He took away the condemnation of the law by fulfilling it, and that man is justified and saved by this faith without good works. Look about and discover how many there are at this day in the Christian world who do not live according to this faith. I know that they will answer that they are weak and imperfect men, born in sins, and the like. But who is not able to think from religion? This the Lord gives to everyone; and with him who thinks these things from religion the Lord works all things, so far as he thinks. And be it known that he who thinks these things from religion believes that there is a God, a heaven, a hell, and a life after death; but he who does not think of these things from religion, I affirm, does not believe them. 903.

This is evident from the signification of a “ cloud,” as being the Divine truth in ultimates, and thus the Word in the sense of the letter (of which above, n. 36, 594); and this cloud appeared “white” because of the shining through it of the Divine truth in the heavens, such as the Word is in the spiritual sense, for all whiteness that appears in the heavens exists from the light of heaven, which in its essence is the Divine truth. This is why the angels, who are in the Divine truth, are clothed in white and shining garments. (That Divine truth proceeding from the Lord as a sun is the light of heaven, may be seen in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 126–140; and that white for this reason is predicated in the Word of truths, see above, n. 196.) 906.

One may wonder that a “cloud” signifies the Word, and “One sitting upon the cloud” signifies the Lord as to the Word, since to those who comprehend all things according to the sense of the letter of the Word, it must needs seem that a “cloud” means a cloud, and not anything spiritual such as the Word is, for the Word does not appear to have any affinity or agreement with a cloud; nevertheless it is the Divine truth in ultimates, such as the Word is in the letter, that is here signified.

[2] The “cloud” that appeared upon Mount Sinai when the Law, which was the Divine truth, was promulgated, had a similar signification, also the “cloud” that was seen every day upon the tent of meeting, and that sometimes filled it; also: The bright cloud that overshadowed Peter, James, and John, when Jesus appeared transfigured; out of which cloud a voice was heard saying, This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye Him (Matt. 17:5; Luke 9:34, 35). Also in the following passages in the Gospels: Then shall appear the sign of the Son of man; and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and glory (Matt. 24:30; Luke 21:27). And Jesus said, Now shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven (Matt. 26:64; Mark 14:61, 62). In these passages also “to come in the clouds of heaven” means the manifestation of the Lord in the Word; for after His coming predictions respecting the Lord were clearly seen in the prophecies of the Word that were not seen before; and they are still more clearly seen at this day, when the spiritual sense of the Word has been opened, in which, in the highest sense, the Lord and the subjugation of the hells by Him and the glorification of His Human are everywhere treated of. This sense is what is meant by the “glory” in which He would come. That “glory” signifies spiritual Divine truth such as it is in the heavens may be seen above (n. 33, 874). All this makes clear what is signified by “the white cloud, and upon the cloud One sitting like unto the Son of man,” which John saw; for what now follows treats of the separation of the good from the evil before the last judg ment, and afterwards of that judgment; the same as was predicted by the Lord in the Gospels, that “He would come in the clouds of heaven”; also in the first chapter of Revelation in these words:"

This is evident from the signification of “a golden crown” on the head, as here being the Divine good girded for judgment; for what now follows treats of the separation of the good from the evil, and this separation precedes the last judgment, thus it treats of “the Son of man” by whom is meant the Lord as to the Divine truth or the Word girded to separate the good from the evil, and afterwards to execute judgment. That this is meant by “the golden crown upon the head of the Son of man,” can be seen from the fact that among the sons of Israel and also among the ancients, kings, who represented the Lord, when they were girded for war and in their battles, wore golden crowns (see above, n. 553); and for the reason that kings represented the Lord as to the Divine truth, and this proceeds from the Lord conjoined with the Divine good; and in order that this might be represented kings wore crowns of gold, since “gold” signifies good (see above, n. 242a, c). That a “golden crown” signifies good and consequent wisdom, and that truths are what are crowned, may also be seen above (n. 272). [2] That an arcanum lies concealed in this is because the Divine good judges no one, but the Divine truth judges; because the Divine good loves all, and so far as man follows it draws to heaven, but the Divine truth separated from good condemns all and judges all to hell. Lest, therefore, all should be condemned and judged to hell, and in order that the Divine good may as far as possible mitigate and raise up to heaven, there was a golden crown on the head, which signified the Divine good girded for judgment, that is, for mitigating. That the Divine good does not judge anyone but the Divine truth, is meant by these words of the Lord: The Father doth not judge anyone, but He hath given all judgment unto the Son (John 5:22). “The Father” means the Divine good, and “the Son” the Divine truth.

Likewise by these words: The Father gave to the Son to execute judgment, because He is the Son of man (John 5:27). “The Son of man” signifies Divine truth (see above, n. 778b). [3] Nevertheless it must be understood that the Lord does not judge anyone by Divine truth; but the Divine truth regarded in itself judges the man who does not receive it but rejects it, as is clearly evident from the Lord’s words: Jesus said, If anyone hear My words and yet believe not, I judge him not, for I have not come to judge the world but to save the world. He that rejecteth Me and receiveth not My words hath one that judgeth him; the Word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day (John 12:47, 48; also John 3:17). “The Word” means the Divine truth, for this is in the Word, and is the Word. That this, regarded in itself, will judge man, and not the Lord Himself by it, is clearly evident, for the Lord says, “I judge him not, for I have not come to judge the world but to save the world.” The Lord Himself does not judge, because He is the Divine love and also the Divine good united with Divine truth, and the one cannot be separated from the other, for they are one; and the Divine good judges no one, but saves, as has been said above. So also does the Divine truth which proceeds from the Lord united with the Divine good. The saying in John, that “it was given to the Son to execute judgment,” must be understood in the same sense as where it is said of Him that “He is angry,” “wrathful,” “casts into hell,” and the like; while in fact the Lord is angry with no one, nor does He cast into hell, but man casts himself thither (on which see in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 545–550). So, too, contempt for and rejection of the Divine truth, consequently falsity from evil, judges man; thus again, the man judges himself.

And in His hand a sharp sickle, signifies the Divine truth accurately exploring and separating. This is evident from the signification of a “sickle,” as being the Divine truth accurately exploring and separating. This is the signification of “sickle,” because it has almost the same signification as “sword (gladius et machaera),” which means in the spiritual sense the Divine truth fighting against falsity and dispersing it (see above, 73, 131, 367); so here in place of sword a “sickle” is mentioned, because the harvest is treated of, respecting which and the sickle more will be said hereafter. “A sharp sickle” signifies the Divine truth accurately exploring and separating, because the “harvest” signifies the last state of the church preceding the last judgment, when the Lord explores everyone and separates; and when this is done the good are raised up into heaven and the evil cast into hell, which is the last judgment. That such exploration and separation are effected before the last judgment, and have also been done at this day, has been set forth to some extent from experience in the work on the Last Judgment, and also above; and more will be said about it in an appendix at the end of this work. [2] That “sharp” signifies what is careful, accurate and complete, is evident without explanation. For a sharp sickle, like a sharp sword, acts with great accuracy and pierces very keenly. This is shown in the following passages. In Isaiah: Jehovah hath made my mouth like a sharp sword (49:2). The “mouth” of the prophet signifies the Divine truth, and for this reason is compared to a sharp sword, meaning that the Divine truth pierces and wholly disperses and destroys falsity.

And elsewhere: Jehovah deliver my soul from the lip of falsehood, from the tongue of deceit, sharp arrows of the mighty (Ps. 120:2, 4).

Verse 15. And another angel went out from the temple, signifies exploration by the Lord of the state of the church in general. This is evident from what follows, namely, that the angel “cried out with a great voice, Send Thy sickle and reap, for the hour for Thee to reap is come, for the harvest of the earth is dried up,” which signifies announcement after exploration that it is the time for gathering up the good and separating them from the evil, because this is the end of the church. Also from the signification of “the temple,” as being heaven and the church, and the Divine proceeding from the Lord (see above, n. 220, 630, 700a). The state of the church in general is here meant, because it is added that “two other angels went forth, one from the temple that is in heaven, and the other from the altar”; and these signify manifestations by the Lord respecting separation. Exploration by the Lord is signified, because an “angel” means in the Word something from the Lord (see above, n. 869, 878, 883); since angels can make no exploration of the state of the church from themselves, but only from the Lord."

It is said “announcement after exploration or visitation,” because visitation precedes separation, and after separation the last judgment is accomplished. Visitation is mentioned in many passages, and it means the exploration of what the state of the church is before the judgment. Not that such visitation exists actually; but before the judgment the angels of heaven begin to lament because of the growing power of the evil from hell, and begin to pray to the Lord for help; for the Lord knows all things, because He is omniscient. Nevertheless, visitation is depicted by the sending of angels and by their announcement; as that, when the last judgment is at hand: The Lord shall send His angels with a great voice of a trumpet, and they shall gather together His elect from the four winds (Matt. 24:31). Not that any angels are sent to gather them together, but the Lord does this by His Divine truth; for “angels,” as has been said, signify Divine truths.

This is evident from the signification of “sending the sickle,” as being to collect the good and separate them from the evil (of which presently); also from the signification of “the hour to reap is come,” as being the time for doing this; also from the signification of “for the harvest of the earth is dried up,” as being the last state or the end of the church, for “harvest” signifies the last state or the end, and “the earth” signifies the church. From this it is clear that “Send Thy sickle and reap, for the hour to reap is come, for the harvest of the earth is dried up,” signifies that it is the time for collecting the good and separating them from the evil, because this is the end of the church. “To send the sickle and reap” means to collect the good and to separate them from the evil, because “the harvest of the earth” signifies the last state of the church, when the last judgment takes place and the evil are cast into hell and the good raised up into heaven, and thus they are separated. [2] That the collecting, separation, and last judgment do not take place before can be seen in the work on the Last Judgment, and will be more fully explained in the appendix to this book. This is briefly set forth in the Lord’s words in Matthew: Jesus spake this parable: The kingdom of the heavens is like unto a man that sowed good seed in his field; but while men slept his enemy came and sowed tares, and went away. But when the blade sprang up and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also. The servants of the father of the family came and said unto him, Lord, didst thou not sow good seed in thy field? whence then hath it tares? And he said unto them, An enemy hath done this. But the servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that going we collect them? But he said, Nay, lest haply while ye collect the tares ye root up at the same time the wheat with them. Rather let both grow together until the harvest; and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Collect first the tares and bind them in bundles to burn them, but gather the wheat into my barn.

He answering said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man; the field is the world; and the seed are the sons of the kingdom; but the tares are the sons of the evil one; and the enemy that soweth them is the devil; while the harvest is the consummation of the age; and the reapers are angels. As then the tares are collected and burned in the fire, so shall it be in the consummation of the age. The Son of man shall send forth His angels, and they shall collect out of His kingdom all things that cause stumbling and them that do iniquity, and shall send them into a furnace of fire; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. Then shall the just shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of the Father (13:24–30, 36–43). The Lord by this parable illustrates all that is said in this chapter of Revelation (in verses 14 to 19) respecting the Son of man having a sickle in His hand and reaping, and that the earth was reaped by Him and the angels. For this parable teaches that the “sower” means the Lord, who is here called “the Son of man”; that the “reapers,” or “those that reap,” mean the angels; also that “the tares shall be cast into a furnace of fire and the good seed gathered into the barn”; and that this could not be done until “the consummation of the age” (which signifies the last state of the church), “lest the wheat should be rooted up at the same time with the tares.” [3] As this parable of the Lord contains arcana respecting the separation of the evil from the good, and the last judgment, it is important that its particulars should be explained. “The kingdom of the heavens” signifies the Lord’s church in the heavens and on earth; for the church is in both. “The man who sowed good seed in his field” means the Lord as to the Divine truth, which is the Word, in the church; “the man,” who is called in the following verses “the Son of man,” is the Lord as to the Word; “good seed” is Divine truth; and “field” the church where the Word is. “While men slept his enemy came and sowed tares, and went away,” signifies that while men are living a natural life, or the life of the world, evils from hell secretly, or while they are unconscious of it, introduce and implant falsities, “to sleep” signifying to live a natural life or the life of the world, since such a life is sleep as compared with spiritual life, which is wakefulness. The “enemy” signifies evils from hell, which influence that life when it is separated from spiritual life; “to sow tares” signifies to insinuate"

[4] “The servants of the father of the family came and said unto him, Lord, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? whence then hath it tares?” signifies those who are in truths from good perceiving that falsities from evil have been mingled with them, and complaining, “the Lord’s servants” signifying those who are in truths from good, “the father of the family” signifying the Lord as to truths from good (”father” the Lord as to good, and “family” the Lord as to truths); the “good seed,” the “field,” and the “tares,” having the same signification as above. “And he said unto them, An enemy hath done this,” signifies that such falsities were from evil in the natural man. “But the servants said to him, Lord, wilt thou then that going we collect the tares?” signifies the separation and casting out of falsities from evil before truths from good are received and increase. “But he said, Nay, lest haply while ye collect the tares ye root up at the same time the wheat with them,” signifies that thus truth from good and its increase would also perish; for truths are mingled with falsities with the men of the church, and these cannot be separated and the falsities cast out until they are reformed. [5] “Rather let both grow together until the harvest; and in the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers, Collect first the tares and bind them in bundles to burn them, but gather the wheat into my barn,” signifies that the separation and casting out of falsities from evil cannot be effected until it is the last state of the church; since it is then that the falsities of evil are separated from the truths of good, and the falsities of evil are delivered up to hell, and the truths of good are conjoined with heaven, or what is the same, the men who are in them. This takes place in the spiritual world, where all who are of the church from its beginning to its end are in this way separated and judged. The “harvest” signifies the end or the"

[6] “He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man” signifies the Divine truth from the Lord. “The field is the world” signifies the church everywhere. “The seed are the sons of the king dom” signifies that the Divine truth is with those who are of the church. “The tares are the sons of the evil one” signifies falsities with those who are in evil. “The enemy that soweth them is the devil” signifies that their falsities are from evil, which is from hell. “The harvest is the consummation of the age” signifies the last time and state of the church. “The reapers are angels” signifies that the Divine truth from the Lord is what separates. “The Son of man shall send forth angels, and they shall collect out of His kingdom all things that cause stumbling,” signifies that the Divine truth from the Lord will remove those things that hinder the separation. “They that work iniquity” signifies those who live wickedly. “And shall send them into a furnace of fire” signifies into the hell where those are who are in love of self and in hatred and revenge. “There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth” signifies where there is what is direful from evils and falsities. “Then shall the just shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of the Father” signifies that those who have done the Lord’s commandments shall live in heaven in heavenly loves and their joys; those are called “just” who acknowledge the Lord and do His commandments. Such was to be the state of the angels after the last judgment, because the superior power which had before been on the side of hell was then restored to heaven, which was a source of joy to the angels with unceasing increase. [7] It remains to give some explanation of the Lord’s words respecting the separation of the evil from the good, namely, “Rather let both grow together until the harvest; and in the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers, Collect first the tares and bind them in bundles to burn them, but gather the wheat into my barn.” This signifies the separation of the evil from the good when the last judgment is at hand.

This might be illustrated by a thousand lessons of experience in both worlds, and also from correspondences in the animal and vegetable kingdom; from which it can be seen as in a general mirror why the evil were not separated from the good until near the time of the last judgment; and this is the signification of the things in Revelation here explained, that the angel said to Him that sat upon the cloud, “Reap, for the hour for Thee to reap is come, for the harvest of the earth is dried up.” 911b. [8] Also in the following passages the “harvest” signifies the last state of the church, when the old church has been laid waste, that is, when there is no longer any truth or good left in it that has not been falsified or cast aside. In Joel: At the valley of Jehoshaphat will I sit to judge all the nations round about. Send forth the sickle, for the harvest is ripe; come, get ye down, for the wine press is full, the vats overflow, for their wickedness is great (3:12, 13). This chapter treats of the falsification of the truth in the Word, and the devastation of the church by it; and this verse treats of the last state of the church, when judgment takes place; and this state is described, as in Revelation, by “sending forth the sickle, for the harvest is ripe,” the “harvest” being that last state; also by “the wine press is full and the vats overflow,” as in this chapter of Revelation (verses 19, 20). That judgment then takes place is plainly declared, “the valley of Jehoshaphat,” where judgment is executed, signifying the falsification of the Word.

Here, too, “the time of harvest” means the last state of the church, when there is no longer any good or any truth; its devastation is described by “cutting off him that soweth and him that handleth the sickle in the time of harvest”; also by “threshing as on a threshing-floor,” “Babylon” meaning those who seek dominion by means of the holy things of the church. [10] In Isaiah: I will bewail for Jazar, the vine of Sibmah; I will water thee with my tears, O Heshbon and Elealeh; for upon thy vintage and upon thy harvest the battle shout hath fallen (16:9). Here again, “harvest” signifies the last state of the church, for “the battle shout” signifies the end, because it was a custom to exult and call out when the vintage was finished and the harvest was gathered in; but here it signifies to lament, because it is said to have fallen. “Jazar, the vine of Sibmah,” and “Heshbon and Elealeh,” signify men of the external church who explain the Word to favor worldly loves, for these places had been given for an inheritance to the tribes of Reuben and Gad, and these, because they dwelt beyond the Jordan, represented the external church. “The vine of Sibmah” signifies the church of such; and their destruction when the Lord should come and accomplish judgment is also described in that chapter. [11] In Jeremiah: The harvest is past, the autumn is ended, and we have not been saved; because of the bruising of my daughter I am bruised (8:20, 21). Here again the “harvest” signifies the last state of the church. “Because of the bruising I am bruised” signifies grief that there is no longer any good and truth, “daughter” signifying the affection of truth, and thus the church, for that affection is of the church and the church is from it."

In the day shalt thou make thy plant to grow, and in the morning shalt thou make thy seed to blossom; the harvest shall be a heap in the day of possession, and desperate sorrow (17:5, 6, 11). This chapter treats of the knowledges of truth and good belonging to the church, and of their destruction. These are here signified by “Damascus,” of which this chapter treats, and by “Aroer.” Their destruction is described by “there shall be left in it gleanings, as in the shaking of an olive tree, three berries in the top of the bough, four or five in the branches16 of the fruit bearing one,” also by “the harvest shall be a heap in the day of possession,” that is, that there shall be no more than a single heap; therefore it is added, “and desperate sorrow.” This makes clear that “harvest” signifies here the last state of the church. That state is signified also by “morning,” for when the last state of the church is at hand it is morning to those who are to be of the new church, and evening and night to those who are of the old church. That this is what “morning” here means is evident from the last verse of this chapter, where it is said: About the time of evening behold terror; before the morning it is not (Isa. 17:14). “Terror” signifies destruction. [13] In Joel: The husbandmen were ashamed, the vine dressers howled for the wheat and for the barley, because the harvest of the field hath perished (1:11). The devastation of the church as to good and truth is here meant by “the harvest of the field hath perished”; “husbandmen” mean those who are in the good of the church, and “vine dressers” those who are in its truths; “wheat and barley” mean good itself and truth"

[14] “Harvest” signifies the last state of the church, because “corn,” which is the harvest, signifies the good of the church and truth from good, and “field” the church itself. That all things pertaining to natural nourishment, such as wheat, barley, oil, wine, and the like, signify such things as pertain to spiritual nourishment has been shown above in many places; and the things that pertain to spiritual nourishment have reference in general to good and truth and knowledges of them, thus to doctrine and to a life according to these knowledges. Therefore it is said in Jeremiah: A nation from afar shall eat up thy harvest and thy bread, it shall eat up thy sons and thy daughters, it shall eat up thy flock and thy herd, it shall eat up thy vine and thy fig tree; it shall impoverish thy fortified cities, in which thou dost trust, with the sword (5:17). “A nation from afar” means the falsity of evil destroying; “from afar” signifying what is far away from good and truth. “Harvest” and “bread” signify nourishing truths and goods of the church; “sons and daughters” goods and truths generating; “flock and herd” goods and truths spiritual and natural, “vine and fig tree” the internal spiritual church, and the external natural church; the “fortified cities in which they trust” signify doctrinals from self- intelligence; “to be impoverished with the sword” signifies to be destroyed by falsities of evil. [15] As “harvest” signifies all things that spiritually nourish man, and these have reference to the truths of doctrine and the goods of life, so “harvest” signifies the church in general and in particular; in general, in these words in the Gospels: Jesus said to His disciples, The harvest is plenteous but the laborers are few; pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest that He send laborers into His harvest (Matt. 9:37, 38; Luke 10:2). The “harvest” here means all with whom the church was to be established by the Lord, thus also the church in general; and “laborers” mean all who will teach from the Lord."

Behold I say unto you, Lift up your eyes and look on the fields that they are white already for harvest. And he that reapeth receiveth reward and gathereth fruit unto life eternal. For herein is the saying true, that there is one who soweth and another who reapeth. I sent you to reap that whereon ye have not labored; others have labored, but ye have entered into their labor (4:35–38). This was said by the Lord of a new church to be established by Him. That the establishment of that church was then at hand is meant by “Lift up your eyes and look on the fields that they are white already for harvest.” To teach those who were to be of that church, or as the Lord says elsewhere, “to collect and gather into the barn,” is signified by “reaping.” That it is the Lord who teaches, thus who collects and gathers, and not themselves (for it was the Lord, by means of the angels, that is, by means of Divine truths from the Word, who prepared for reception those whom the disciples converted to the church), is meant by “there is one who soweth and another who reapeth; I sent you to reap that whereon ye have not labored; others have labored, but ye have entered into their labor.” [17] The increase of the church with man in particular, and with men in general by the Lord, is also described by “harvest” in Mark: Jesus said, So is the kingdom of God as if a man should cast seed upon the earth, and should then sleep and rise night and day, and the seed should spring up and grow up he knoweth not how. For the earth beareth fruit of herself, first the blade, then the ear, then the full corn in the ear. But when the fruit hath come forth straightway he putteth forth the sickle, because the harvest is ready (4:26–29). “The kingdom of God” means the church of the Lord in the heavens and on the earth; and the implantation of it with all who receive truths and goods from the Lord, not from self, is described by these words, every particular of which corresponds to spiritual things and signifies them; as that “a man casts seed upon the earth, that he then sleeps, and rises night and day, that the seed springs up and grows up he knows not how”; for “seed” signifies the Divine truth, “to cast seed into the earth” signifies the work of man, “to"

The rest signifies the Lord’s work; and the “harvest” the implantation of the church in particular and in general. For it is to be known that, although the Lord works all things, and man nothing from self, yet He wills that man should work as if from self in all that comes to his perception. For without man’s cooperation as if from self there can be no reception of truth and good, thus no implantation and regeneration. For to will is the Lord’s gift to man; and because the appearance to man is that this is from self, He gives him to will as if from self. [18] Such being the signification of “harvest” two feasts were instituted with the sons of Israel, one of which was called the feast of seven weeks, which was that of the harvest of firstfruits; and the other the feast of tabernacles, which was the feast of ingathering of the fruits of the earth. Of these the first signified the implantation of truth in good, and the other the bringing forth of good, thus regeneration. But the feast of unleavened bread, or the Passover, which preceded, signified deliverance from the falsities of evil, which is the first thing of regeneration. 912. Verse 16. And He that sat upon the cloud cast the sickle upon the earth, and the earth was reaped, signifies the collection of the good and their separation from the evil, and that thus the church was laid waste. This is evident from the signification of “Him who sat upon the cloud,” as being the Lord as to the Word, which is the Divine truth; from which and according to the reception of which judgment is effected; also from the signification of “the earth,” as being the church (see above, n. 29, 304, 417a, 697, 741b-d, 752, 876); also from the signification of “the earth was reaped,” as being that the church was laid waste. For “harvest” signifies the last state of the church, as has been shown above (n. 911), therefore “the earth was reaped” signifies that there is no church, or that it has been laid waste, because there is no longer any good or any truth therefrom, which are signified by the grain of the harvest. It is here said that “the earth was reaped” by Him who sat upon the cloud, but the meaning is that this is done by man; as in many other passages where devastation is attributed to the Lord, when yet it is wrought by man; for man from his first idea can see it in no other"

But on this subject see what has been said in the work on the Last Judgment, as well as in several passages above, and what will be said specifically in the appendix to this work; for unless these things were explained in their series they could not fall into the understanding except in an obscure way. 913.

All this makes clear that “the first angel” (in verse 15) means manifestation by the Lord, also exploration of what the church was, and that it was found to be desolated. From this it follows that “another angel went out from the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle,” signifies manifestation by the Lord of the devastation of the church, as to the Divine truth such as it is in heaven, after exploration.

This Divine truth is for men, and makes the church with them; while the other Divine truth is for the angels, and makes heaven with them. These differ as what is spiritual differs from what is natural; and this difference is like the difference between the wisdom of angels and the wisdom of men. The wisdom of men as compared with the wisdom of angels is as knowledge compared with intelligence, which difference is so great that it cannot be described. [3] As to the devastation of the church in respect to the Divine truth, it is wrought by the falsification of the Word; for when the Word is explained to favor earthly loves and to confirm falsities of doctrine the church is laid waste. It is not laid waste when the Word is understood in simplicity according to the sense of the letter; but it is laid waste when the Word is so explained as to destroy even the Divine truth in heaven; for then heaven is closed up, and when heaven is closed up there is no longer any church with man. There are those within the church who explain the sense of the letter of the Word even so as to destroy the Divine truth in heaven; and there are those who do not misinterpret it to that degree, and these do not devastate the church with them, but the former do. The sense of the letter understood in simplicity does no harm to any spiritual truth in heaven; but the sense of the letter explained according to falsities of doctrine, and in harmony with evils of the love, does harm to it, for the sense of the letter of the Word is natural Divine truth. This Divine truth differs indeed from spiritual truth as what is natural differs from what is spiritual, and yet they make one by correspondences. But when natural Divine truth is so explained as even to destroy spiritual Divine truth they can no longer make one by correspondence; but the falsity according to which natural Divine truth is explained destroys the spiritual Divine truth. This, then, is the falsification of the Word and the devastation of the church by falsifications. But on this more has been said where “the dragon and his two beasts” are treated of; and more will be said upon it where “the harlot sitting on the scarlet beast,” and “Babylon,” are treated of in what follows."

And another angel went out from the altar, signifies manifestation by the Lord of the devastation of the church as to the good of love and charity. This is evident from the signification of “an angel going out,” as being manifestation by the Lord (see above, n. 914); also from the signification of “altar,” as being in the highest sense the Divine good of the Divine love; and in a relative sense the good of love to the Lord, and the good of charity towards the neighbor (see above, n. 391, 490). Why “the altar” has this signification shall be told in a few words. In the church instituted among the sons of Israel there were two things that were the chief things of worship, namely, the tent of meeting and the altar, and afterwards the temple and the altar. In the temple the Word was taught, and upon the altar sacrifices were made, and these were the chief things of their worship; and as the church established among them was a representative church these two represented in brief all things of the church; and all things of the church in brief relate to the truth of doctrine from the Word and to the good of love and charity. Moreover, from these two all the worship of the church comes; and as all the representatives of the church looked to the Lord as the end and as the cause, thus as the one to whom all things relate and from whom they are, so the temple represented the Lord as to the Divine truth, and the altar the Lord as to the Divine good. (On this representation of the temple see above, n. 220; and of the altar, n. 391, 490.) Now as all things of the church, and thus of worship, relate to these two, namely, to the truth of doctrine and the good of love, and all things of heaven to the Divine truth and the Divine good, both from the Lord, and as there is no longer any church when these two are laid waste, so two angels appeared to John, and by these the devastation of the church in respect to both was represented. 916. Having authority over the fire, signifies thus as to celestial and spiritual love. This is evident from the signification of “fire,” as being love in both senses, namely, love to the Lord, which exists with those in heaven who are called celestial angels, and love towards the neighbor, which exists with those in heaven who are called spiritual angels; and in the contrary sense love of self, which exists with those in hell who are called devils, and love of the world, which exists with those in hell who are called satans.

It is said of this angel that “he had authority over the fire,” because the devastation of the church as to the good of love is treated of, and the devastation as to that is attributed to this angel, as the devastation as to the truth of doctrine is attributed to the former angel, who was therefore said to have “a sharp sickle in his hand.” This makes clear what is meant by its being said that this angel “had authority over the fire”; namely, that he will lay waste celestial and spiritual love, and all things of it in the church. [2] The devastation of the church is attributed to an angel, as elsewhere in the Word it is attributed to the Lord. But this is said of the Lord merely in the sense of the letter, but is not so understood in the spiritual sense. For truth in the sense of the letter is like a face seen through a veil, while truth in the spiritual sense is like a face uncovered; or truth in the sense of the letter is like a cloud, while the truth in the spiritual sense is like light and its splendor; or again, truth in the sense of the letter is what appears to be truth to the sensual man, while truth in the spiritual sense is truth to the spiritual-rational man. For example, it is said in the Word that the sun rises, moves forward, and sets, making days and years, which is wholly according to the way it appears to the sensual man. Nevertheless, the rational man thinks of the sun as not moving, and of the earth as moving; which shows that man’s understanding thinks in a reverse way of the things that appear before the senses in order that they may be presented before it in the light of truth. It is similar with the things here said in Revelation of “Him who sat on the white cloud” and of the angels, namely, that “they send the sickle into the harvest and reap it,” and that “they gather the clusters of the vineyard of the earth, and cast them into the wine press of the anger of God.” All this, too, is said according to the way it appears to the sensual man; and yet it must be reversed, and understood according to its spiritual sense. [3] All this makes clear that a sensual man, such as one is in the ages of infancy and early childhood, also the simple-minded, can think about and believe these and like things according to the sense of the letter, as that God takes away good and truth from men on account of their wickedness; while the adult man who wishes to be"

For if a wise adult should explain such expressions according to the sense of the letter and confirm them by reasonings, he would destroy the genuine truth itself such as it is in heaven, and consequently would close up heaven to himself. For how could anyone enter heaven with a belief that God is angry and revengeful, that He punishes, and the like, when the angels of heaven are in the perception that God is never angry, and never works vengeance, or punishes? Would they not turn themselves away from such a one and bid him depart, and immediately close the door after him? So is heaven closed to those who, while they live in the world, explain the sense of the letter of the Word even so as to destroy Divine truth in the heavens; which truth is also the same as the truth of the spiritual sense, which is in all the particular truths of the natural sense which constitute the sense of the letter of the Word. 917. And he cried with a great cry to Him that had the sharp sickle, signifies announcement after exploration or visitation, as is evident from what follows, also from what has been said and explained above (n. 910), where nearly the same words occur. 918. Saying, Send thy sharp sickle and gather the clusters of the earth, for her grapes are fully ripened, signifies that the collection and the separation of the good from the evil must take place, since there are no longer any truths of faith because there is no spiritual good, which is charity. This is evident from the signification of “sending the sharp sickle and gathering,” as being to collect the good and to separate them from the evil (see above, n. 911). “To gather” has here the same signification as “to reap” above, but “to gather” has reference to clusters and grapes, and “to reap” has reference to the harvest; and both signify to devastate and make an end of the church, which is signified both by “harvest” and “vineyard”; and when the church is devastated, and thus brought to an end, the good are collected and separated from the evil.

Also from the signification of “for her grapes are fully ripened,” as being, because there are no longer any goods of charity, thus because the church is at its end. From all this it can be seen that “send thy sharp sickle and gather the clusters of the earth, for her grapes are fully ripened,” signifies that the collection and the separation of the good from the evil must take place, since there are no longer any goods or truths of faith because there is no spiritual good, which is charity. There are no truths of faith when there is no good of charity, because truth is not given without good, since truth derives its essence or its life from good; from which it follows that there are no truths and no faith in truths when there is no good or charity. [2] What charity is, which is the same as spiritual good, shall be told briefly. Charity or spiritual good is to do good because it is true; thus it is to do truth, and to do truth is to do what the Lord has commanded in His Word. This shows that charity is spiritual good. And when a man does what is good because it is true, that is, does what is true, charity becomes moral good; and this is similar in external form to the good that every man who is a moral and civil man does at the present day, but with this difference, that genuine moral good is good from the spiritual good from which it proceeds. For spiritual good is from the Lord, but moral good is from man, consequently unless the good that man does is from the Lord, that is, through man from the Lord, it is not good, the end for the sake of which it is done determines its quality. Moral good separated from spiritual good has regard to man, his honor, gain, and pleasure, as the end for which it is done; while moral good from spiritual good has regard to the Lord, heaven, and eternal life, as its end. This has been said to make known why there is no truth of faith where there is no good of charity; consequently where these two are not, the church is laid waste, which is the subject treated of here and in what now follows in Revelation. (That there is no faith where there is no charity can be seen in the small work on the Last Judgment, n. 33–39.) [3] That “clusters” and “grapes” signify the good of charity can be seen from the passages in the Word where they are mentioned, as in the following. In Jeremiah:"

But this can be seen explained above (n. 403b). [4] In Isaiah: My beloved had a vineyard in the horn of a son of oil, which he fenced, and gathered out the stones, and planted it with a noble vine, and built a tower in the midst of it, and also hewed out a wine press in it; and he looked that it should bring forth grapes, but it brought forth wild grapes (5:1, 2, 4). The “vineyard” that the beloved had signifies the spiritual church which was instituted with the sons of Israel; “in the horn of a son of oil” signifies that it had truths from the good of charity; “which he fenced, and gathered out the stones,” signifies that it was protected from falsities and evils; “he planted it with a noble vine” signifies that it had genuine truths; “he built a tower in the midst of it” signifies the interior things that receive influx, and through which there is communication with heaven; “he also hewed out a wine press in it” signifies bringing forth truth from good; “and he looked that it should bring forth grapes, but it brought forth wild grapes,” signifies a hope of the fructification of truths from the good of charity, but in vain, because there was iniquity in the place of good. [5] In Micah: Woe is me, I am become as the gatherings of the summer, as the gleanings of the vintage; there is no cluster to eat; my soul desireth the first ripe fruit. The holy one has perished from the earth, and the upright one among men; all lie in wait for bloods (7:1, 2).

This is said of the Ancient Church, and its establishment. That church is here meant by “Israel”; its first state by “in the desert,” and “in the beginning”; and the spiritual good with them by “grapes”; and the good springing from it in the natural man by “the first ripe fruit on the fig tree.” [7] That the men of the Ancient Church, and not the sons of Jacob, are here meant by “Israel in the desert,” and by “their fathers in the beginning,” is evident in Moses: Their vine was of the vine of Sodom and of the fields of Gomorrah; their grapes were grapes of gall, their clusters were of bitternesses (Deut. 32:32). Here the sons of Jacob, such as they were in the desert, are described. That their religion was infernal, because they worshiped the gods and idols of the nations, is signified by “their vine was of the vine of Sodom and of the fields of Gomorrah.” That instead of the goods of charity they had hatred, and falsities breaking forth therefrom instead of truths, is signified by “their grapes were grapes of gall, their clusters were of bitternesses.” [8] In Moses:"

This is in the last address of the father Israel to his sons; this was said to Judah, by whom is meant in the highest sense the Lord as to the celestial church and as to the Word; and the “blood of grapes” signifies the Divine truth from His Divine good, and in the relative sense the good of charity. (But this and the other things here said may be seen explained in the Arcana Coelestia, n. 6375–6379.) “The blood of grapes,” like “wine,” signifies also truth from spiritual good (Deut. 32:14). [9] The “grapes” signify the good of charity because a “vineyard” signifies the spiritual church, and “vine” the man of that church; and therefore “clusters” or “bunches,” and “grapes,” which are its fruits, signify the goods which make that church, which are called spiritual goods and also goods of charity. And as all truth is from good, as all wine is from grapes, so “wine” signifies in the Word truth from good. (On this signification of “wine” see above, n. 220b, 376.) But “clusters” or “bunches” signify strictly the variations of the state of spiritual good, or of the good of charity, because in them many grapes are connected together in order. What is meant by variations of the state of good will be told elsewhere. [10] As “the land of Canaan” represented and thus signified the church, and the church is a church from spiritual good, for this is the mark of the church, therefore: The explorers of that land brought back a cluster of grapes of a remarkable size, carried on a pole by two (Num. 13:23, 24). This was a representative sign of the church that was signified by “the land of Canaan.” The church is a church from the good of charity because that good regarded in itself is the good of life arising from love to the Lord; consequently it is an effect of that love. The good of charity means justice, sincerity, and uprightness in every work and in every function from a love of justice, sincerity, and uprightness, which love is solely from the Lord."

Of his abstinence from grapes and from wine it is said: He shall abstain from wine and strong drink, he shall drink no vinegar of wine or vinegar of strong drink, yea, he shall not drink any maceration of grapes, nor eat fresh grapes or dried; all the days of his Naziriteship he shall eat nothing that is made of the grape of the vine, from the kernels even to the skin (Num. 6:3, 4). This was the law for the Nazirite before he had fulfilled the days of his Naziriteship, because he then represented the Lord as to His first state. The Lord’s first state, like that of every man, was a sensual state. For every man is first sensual, afterwards he becomes natural and rational, then spiritual, and finally, if the third degree is opened with him, he becomes celestial, like an angel of the third heaven. The sensual of man is signified by “the hair of the head” (see above, n. 66, 555). And as the sensual is the most external part of man’s life, and in that all power resides, therefore the Nazirites had so great strength. That all power resides in the most external or ultimate things, consequently in the ultimate sense of the Word, which is the sense of the letter, and that this is what “hair” corresponds to and signifies, may be seen above (n. 346, 417, 567, 666, 726). Such power the Lord had when He was a boy, and by it He conquered and subjugated the most direful hells, where all are sensual. This state of the Lord was represented by “the days of fulfillment” with the Nazirites, and when these were fulfilled the Lord entered from the sensual and natural into the spiritual and celestial Divine. Now as that state, with its good and truth, is signified by “grapes” and “wine,” it was not lawful for the Nazirite to eat grapes or to drink wine until he had fulfilled those days. That it was lawful for him afterwards is evident from the twentieth verse of that chapter, where it is said, “And after that the Nazirite may drink wine.” [12] At the end of the days of fulfillment:"

This represented the sensual that was then new from the celestial Divine, for new hair grew afterwards upon the Nazirite. This also represented that the Lord from ultimate Divine truth, which is the sense of the letter, entered into interior Divine truth, which is the Word in the internal sense, even to its highest. For when the Lord was in the world He was the Word, because He was the Divine truth, and that more interiorly by degrees as He grew up, even to its highest, which is purely Divine and wholly above the perceptions of the angels. It is to be known that while the Lord was in the world, from infancy even to the last day there, He progressed successively to union with the Divine Itself that was in Him from conception. (On this successive progression see the Arcana Coelestia, n. 1864, 2033, 2632, 3141, 4585, 7014, 10076.) This makes clear what was represented by the Nazirite not being allowed to eat anything from the grape, or to drink any kind of wine, until the days of his Naziriteship were fulfilled. 919. Verse 19. And the angel cast his sickle into the earth and gathered the vineyard of the earth, signifies that this was done. This is evident from what has been just said in the preceding article. That a “vineyard” signifies the spiritual church is evident from the passages in the Word where “vineyard” is mentioned (as in Isa. 1:8, 3:14; 5:1–10; 16:10; 36:17; 37:30; 65:21; Jer. 12:10; 32:15; 35:7, 9; 39:10; Ezek. 28:26; Hosea 2:15; Amos 4:9; 5:11, 17; 9:14; Micah 1:6; Zeph. 1:13; 1 Sam. 8:14, 15; Ps. 107:37; Matt. 20:1–8; 21:28, 38–41; Mark 12:1–9; Luke 13:6, 7; 20:9–16). And concerning a “vine” see John 15:1–12; as well as in the historical parts of the Word. From these passages it is clearly evident that a “vineyard” means the church (see also above, n. 376b, c, 403b, 638a, 918, where many passages in which “vineyard” occurs are explained). From the signification of “vineyard” it can be seen that “to gather the vintage” signifies to collect for uses those things that will be serviceable to the understanding, and which will give intelligence and wisdom; and in the contrary sense it signifies to lay waste the church as to spiritual good, and thus as to the affection of truth and the understanding of truth. In this contrary sense “vintage” and “to gather the vintage” are used in the sense that"

In Isaiah: A cry over the wine in the streets; every joy shall be mixed; the gladness of the earth shall be banished. The remnant in the city is a waste, and the gate shall be beaten down even to devastation. For so shall it be in the midst of the land as the beating of an olive tree, as the gleanings when the vintage is finished (24:11–13). This describes the mourning over the devastation of the church as to celestial good and as to spiritual good, which in its essence is truth from celestial good. This devastation is compared to “the beating of an olive tree,” and to “the gleanings when the vintage is finished.” (But this may be seen explained above, n. 313b, 638c). [3] In the same: Ye confident daughters, perceive My word in your ears; year17 upon year shall ye be troubled, ye confident ones, for the vintage is finished, the ingathering shall not come (Isa. 32:9, 10). “Confident daughters” signify those in the church who love falsities more than truths. That with such, truths are gradually diminished in every state, is signified by “year18 upon year shall ye be troubled.” The devastation of all truth until there is nothing left is signified by “the vintage is finished, and the ingathering shall not come.” [4] In Jeremiah: Upon thy fruits of autumn and upon thy vintage hath the spoiler fallen, therefore gladness and joy are gathered out of Carmel (48:32, 33)."

That the delight of spiritual and celestial love, which is the very joy of the heart, will perish, is signified by “gladness and joy shall be gathered out of Carmel.” [5] In Micah: Woe is me, I am become as the gatherings of the summer, as the gleanings of the vintage; there is no cluster to eat; my soul desireth the first ripe fruit (7:1). “As the gleanings of the vintage, there is no cluster to eat,” signifies such devastation of the church that there is no longer any good or truth. (The rest may be seen explained in the preceding article.) In Jeremiah: If the grape gatherers came to thee they would leave no gleanings; if thieves in the night they would destroy sufficiency (49:9). In Obadiah: If thieves came to thee, if destroyers by night, how wouldst thou be cut off? Would they not steal till they had enough? If the grape gatherers came to thee would they leave any clusters? (verse 5). “Grape gatherers” signify falsities, and “thieves” evils, which lay waste the truths and goods of the church; but “destroyers” signify both falsities and evils; that “they would leave no clusters” signifies that there are no goods because there are no truths. But “to gather the vintage” signifies to gather for uses such things especially as will be serviceable to the understanding, see in Jer. 6:9; Lev. 19:10, 26:5; Deut. 20:6, 7, 24:21. 920.

This is evident from the signification of “wine press” as being the bringing forth of truth from good; for “clusters” and “grapes,” which were put into the wine press, signify spiritual good, and “wine” which is produced, signifies truth from that good (see above, n. 220b, 376). As “the wine press” signifies the bringing forth of truth from spiritual good, so in the contrary sense it signifies the bringing forth of falsity from evil. For in like manner as good brings forth truth, so evil opposite to good, brings forth falsity. “Wine press” signifies here the falsification of the Word as to all spiritual truth, because it is called “the great wine press of the anger of God,” and “the anger of God” signifies man’s contempt for truth and good and his rejection of it, and the full rejection of it is the falsification of the sense of the letter of the Word even to the destruction of spiritual truth, that is, of the Divine truth which is in heaven. That this falsification closes heaven may be seen (n. 888). Moreover, those who are in evil (and all are in evil who are not in the good of charity) cannot do otherwise than bring forth falsities; for as good brings forth truths so evil brings forth falsities. “The great wine press of the anger of God” signifies also damnation, because this is a consequence, and because the terms “anger of God” and “great wine press” are used. That this is what a “wine press” signifies will be confirmed from the Word in the next article. [2] Here a few words shall be said about the bringing forth of truth from good, and also of falsity from evil, which is signified by “wine press” in the spiritual sense. The origin and cause of such bringing forth is that all good is from love, and that which is loved gives delight; and as delight is grateful and pleasing, that which is of the love man thinks about with delight and also confirms. And since love with its delight constitutes the life of man, when man thinks from love and its delight he thinks from self and from his life. That this is so can be clearly seen from men after death, when they have become spirits; for then, when they think from self, they can think in no other way than from their love, since their whole life is their love. Since, therefore, good is from love and truth is from thought, it is clear how truth is brought forth from good."

The same that has been said of good and truth can be said of heat and light; for spiritual heat is the love that enkindles the will, and the spiritual light is the truth that enlightens the understanding. For all love, which is from the will, presents an effigy of itself in the light of the understanding, where it recognizes itself and wishes to see itself, because it loves itself; and this is why man thinks what he loves.

For all evil is from the love, and therefore it loves falsity; and evil is from the will, and falsity is from the thought from evil. This has been said because “wine press” signifies in the spiritual sense the bringing forth of truth from good, also the bringing forth of falsity from evil. “The great wine press of the anger of God” signifies also the falsification of the word, because the falsification of the Word is the bringing forth of falsity from evil; for evil is what falsifies, since evil loves the idea of itself in the thought, and the thought, that it may persuade, wishes to find confirmation of the evil in the Word. 921.

The above is evident also from the signification of “without the city,” as being from hell, for “city” signifies the doctrine of truth from the Word (see above, n. 223), while “without the city” signifies the doctrine of falsity from the Word falsified; and as the falsification of the Word is from hell, “without the city” means out of hell. In the Word “city” signifies doctrine, and “the city of David,” that is, Zion, and “the city of Jerusalem,” signify the church as to the Word and as to doctrine from the Word, therefore “without the city” signifies, not from the Word and doctrine from the Word; and what is not from the Word and from doctrine therefrom is from hell. “Without the city” has a like signification as “without the camp” of the sons of Israel in the desert, for their “camp” signified heaven and the church, and “without the camp,” signified hell. For this reason the lepers and all that were unclean were sent out of the camp (Lev. 13:46; Num. 5:1–6); and the excrements, by which things infernal were signified, were left without the camp (Deut. 23:13, 14). 922b. [2] That the “wine press” and “treading it” signify the bringing forth of falsity from evil and the bringing forth of truth from good, can be seen from the Word where “wine press” is mentioned. That it signifies the bringing forth of falsity from evil can be seen from the following passages. In Lamentations: The Lord hath prostrated all my strong ones in the midst of me, He hath proclaimed against me an appointed time for breaking my young men; the Lord hath trodden the wine press for the daughter of Judah (1:15). This treats of the end of the church with the Jewish nation; and “the strong ones whom the Lord hath prostrated in the midst thereof” signifies the destruction of the love of good; those who are in love of good are called in the Word “strong ones,” because good from its love prevails over the hells, and is therefore “strong.” “In the midst” signifies all and everywhere. “To break the young men” signifies the destruction of all the understanding of truth; “an"

In the sense of the letter this is attributed to the Lord; but this is reversed in the spiritual sense, in which it is meant that this was done by that nation itself. [3] In Joel: Send forth the sickle, for the harvest is ripe; come, get ye down, for the wine press is full, the vats have overflowed; for their wickedness is great (3:13.) The devastation of the church as to good and as to truth is thus described; and “the wine press is full and the vats have overflowed” signifies that there was nothing except falsities from evil. (The rest may be seen explained, n. 911 b). In Hosea: Be not glad, O Israel, over a likeness, like the nations: for thou hast committed whoredom under thy God; thou hast loved the reward of whoredom upon all corn floors; the floor and the wine press shall not feed them, and the new wine shall be false to her (9:2). This treats of the falsification of the Word; “the floor and the wine press shall not feed them” signifies that they will not draw from the Word the goods and truths that nourish the soul. (But this passage also has been explained above, n. 695d .) [4] In Jeremiah: Upon thy vintage hath the spoiler fallen; therefore gladness and joy are gathered out of Carmel, and out of the land of Moab; and I have caused the wine to cease from the wine presses; none shall tread with shouting; the shouting shall be no shouting (48:32–34)."

[5] In Isaiah: Who is this that cometh from Edom, His garments sprinkled from Bozrah, He that is honorable in His apparel, walking in the multitude of His strength? I that speak in justice, mighty to save. Wherefore art Thou red in Thy garment, and Thy garments as of one that treadeth in the wine press? I have trodden the wine press alone; and of the people not a man was with Me; therefore have I trodden them in mine anger, and trampled them in My wrath; therefore their victory is sprinkled upon My garments, and I have stained all My raiment (63:1–3). This is said of the Lord, and of His combats against all the hells; and as He fought against them from the Human, in which was the Divine Itself, it is said, “Who is this that cometh from Edom, His garments sprinkled from Bozrah?” which signifies fighting from the good of love and from truth, which are from the Divine; for Edom means red, and Bozrah gathering the vintage; and “red” is predicated of good, and “gathering the vintage” of truth; and because this is what Edom and Bozrah mean, the expressions “red” and “as one treading in the wine press” are afterwards used. And as the Divine good and the Divine truth that are here meant are the Word in the letter, and this is what is signified by the Lord’s “garments” it is said, “garments sprinkled,” also “honorable in His apparel.” And as all strength in the Word is in the letter it is said, “walking in the multitude of His strength.” Judgment from His Divine upon the good and upon the evil and consequent salvation, is meant by “I that speak in justice, mighty to save.” The violence offered to the Word by the Jewish nation is signified by “Wherefore art Thou red in Thy garments, and Thy garments as of one that treadeth in the wine press?” “Red in garment” is predicated of the violence offered to the Divine good of the Word, which is meant above by “Edom,” and “garments as of one that treadeth in the wine press” is predicated of the violence offered to"

The casting down of the hells and of their falsities by His own power is signified by “I have trodden the wine press alone, and of the people not a man was with Me.” The casting down into the hells of those who were in direful evils and in falsities therefrom is signified by “I have trodden them in Mine anger and trampled them in My wrath”; “anger” is predicated of evils, and “wrath” of falsities; and these are attributed to the Lord; al though it is those who are in evils and in falsities therefrom that are angry and wrathful against the Lord. And as the judgment by which the hells were subjugated was accomplished by the Lord by means of temptations admitted into His Human, even to the last, which was the passion of the cross, it is said, “therefore their victory is sprinkled upon My garments, and I have stained all My raiment.” For by all things of His passion and by the last temptation on the cross the Lord represented the violence offered by the Jewish nation to the Word, that is, to Divine truth (see above, n. 183b, 195c, 627c, 655a, 805d). 922c. [6] That “wine press” and “treading it” signify the bringing forth of truth from good, because “the grape” signifies spiritual good, and “wine from the grape” truth from that good, can be seen from the following passages. In Joel: Rejoice, ye sons of Zion, the floors are full of corn, and the winepresses overflow with new wine and oil (2:23, 24). “Sons of Zion” signify those who are in wisdom from the Divine truth; “the floors are full of corn” signifies that they have celestial good in abundance; “the wine presses overflow with new wine and oil” signifies that from the good of charity they have truth and its delight.

The “vineyard” which the householder planted signifies the church that was instituted with the sons of Jacob; the “hedge” which he set about it signifies protection from the falsities of evil, which are from hell; “and digged a wine press in it” signifies that it had spiritual good; “and built a tower” signifies interior truths from that good which looked to heaven; “and let it out to husbandmen” signifies to that people; “they slew the servants that were sent to them” signifies that they slew the prophets; “and finally the son” signifies the Lord. [8] In Isaiah: My beloved had a vineyard in a horn of a son of oil, which he fenced and gathered out the stones, and planted it with a noble vine, and built a tower in the midst of it, and also hewed out a wine press in it; and he looked that it should bring forth grapes, but it brought forth wild grapes (5:1, 2). “Vineyard,” “tower,” and “wine press,” have a like signification here as just above in Matthew. (The rest may be seen explained n. 918.) In most passages, where “vintage” and “wine press” are mentioned, the “harvest” and “corn floor” are also mentioned (as in Hos. 9:1, 2; Joel 2:23, 24; 3:13; Num. 18:26–30; Deut. 15:14; 16:13; 2 Kings 6:27); and for the reason that “harvest” and “corn floor,” from “corn” and “bread” signify the good of celestial love, which is love to the Lord; and “vintage” and “wine press,” from the “grape” and the “wine,” signify the good of spiritual love, which is love towards the neighbor; for these two loves make one, like an efficient cause and its effect. This has been said because here in Revelation the “harvest” is mentioned, and afterwards the “vintage” in the same way. (For the “harvest” see verses 14, 15; and the “vintage,” verse 19.) 923.

(On this signification of “blood” see above, n. 329f, g.) The above is evident also from the signification of “even to the bridles of the horses,” as being even to dominion over the understanding; for “horses” signify the understanding, and their “bridles” government and dominion, for one who sits on a horse governs it and rules over it by means of the bridle. (That “horses” signify the understanding of truth from the Word may be seen above, n. 355, 364; and that “bridles” signify government and dominion will be seen below.) [2] In regard to dominion over the understanding, it is the understanding of truth in the Word that is meant; for when falsities of religion are confirmed by the sense of the letter of the Word the understanding no longer sees truth. For everyone who is in the spiritual affection of truth is enlightened by the Lord when he reads the Word, and it is the understanding that is enlightened. But he who is not in the spiritual affection of truth cannot have his understanding enlightened; for he sees truth as if in the night, and falsity as if in the light. And as the church is such at its end the understanding of truth then so far perishes that it cannot be enlightened, since falsities of religion are then to that extent confirmed from the Word, that is, the Word is falsified. This takes place with those who are meant by “Babylon,” verse 8, and by “the beast,” verse 10, of this chapter. For it is said of Babylon that “she hath given all nations to drink of the wine of the anger of her whoredom”; and of the beast there that “he that hath adored the beast shall drink of the wine of the anger of God mixed with unmixed wine of His wrath.” That falsifications of the Word are thereby signified may be seen above (n. 881 and 887). [3] The understanding of truth in the Word would perish with such as are meant by “them that dwell in Babylon” and “the worshipers of the beast,” because they have no spiritual good; and this good, which is the good of charity from the Lord, is what alone opens the spiritual mind, through which the Lord flows in and"

And when he wishes to see it or to comprehend it in thought, mere shadows from falsities, which spring from fallacies and from what is man’s own hover over him and induce blindness. All this makes clear what is meant by the falsifications of the Word flowing forth from evil, even to dominion over the understanding, which are signified by “blood going out from the wine press, even to the bridles of the horses.” [4] The term “bridle” is used in some passages in the Word, and it signifies in the spiritual sense restraint and government, and it is predicated of the understanding and its thought, because a bridle belongs to horses, and “horses” signify the understanding; and with those who have no understanding “horses” signify reasonings from falsities. This makes clear what is signified by “bridle” in Isaiah: I will put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will bring thee back by the way by which thou camest (37:29). This was said of the king of Assyria by whom reasoning from falsities is signified; for “Assyria” signifies in a good sense the rational. Because that king then besieged Jerusalem and blasphemed God it was said to him that “a hook should be put into his nose,” which signifies that stupidity and foolishness should possess him; for the “nose” signifies perception, and a “hook” signifies taking it away, or properly, immersing it in the corporeal sensual, and when this is separated from the rational it is stupid. It was also said that “a bridle should be put in his lips,” which signifies insanity as to the understanding of truth, for the “lips” signify thought from the understanding, and a “bridle” the withdrawal of it. “To bring him back into the way by which he came” signifies into the falsities by which he will perish; therefore his army, which signifies falsities, perished by a very great slaughter.

Because it appears that heaven does this, or what is the same, the Divine truth from which heaven exists, it is said to have “indignation,” to be “a devouring fire,” and “an overflowing stream.” “It shall reach even to the middle of the neck” signifies the devastation of it by falsities, even till it is not understood, for the “neck” signifies conjunction, and conjunction perishes when that which is beneath is taken away. “To sift the nations with the sieve of vanity” signifies the adulteration of the Word by those who are in evils by means of fictions; “and a bridle that misleadeth upon the jaws of the peoples” signifies the falsification of the truth in the Word by those who are in falsities, “a bridle that misleadeth” being properly a withdrawing from the understanding of truth, “jaws” being thoughts from the corporeal sensual, thus from fallacies; and the term “peoples” being used of those who are in falsities; and “nations” of those who are in evils. They who are ignorant of correspondences might think that it is merely from comparison that a “horse’s bridle” signifies government over the understanding; but it is from correspondence, as can be seen clearly from the fact that in the spiritual world horses are seen variously harnessed and caparisoned, and these horses, with everything upon them, are correspondences. 924.

Verse 1. And I saw another sign in heaven, signifies revelation by the Lord of the state of the church just before the last judgment. This is evident from the signification of a “sign,” as being revelation; also from the signification of “heaven,” as being the Lord (of which presently). A “sign” signifies revelation because by a “sign” are meant those things that were seen by John, and that are described in what follows; and the things seen by him involve arcana respecting the state of the church just before the last judgment. For in general, whatever appears in heaven has precisely the same appearance as the things which exist in our material world in its three kingdoms; and such things appear before the eyes of the angels in just the same way as the things of the three kingdoms appear before the eyes of men in the world. There appear there gold, silver, copper, tin, lead, stones precious and not precious, soil, lands, mountains, hills, valleys, waters, fountains, and other things of the mineral kingdom. There appear paradises, gardens, forests, fruit trees of every kind, lawns, fields of grain, meadows filled with flowers, plants, and grasses of every kind; also things produced from these, as oils, wines, strong drinks, and other things of the vegetable kingdom. There appear animals of the earth, flying things of heaven, fishes of the sea, creeping things, and these of every kind, and so much like those on our earth that they cannot be distinguished. I have seen them, and could see no difference. [2] Still there is this difference, that the things seen in heaven are from a spiritual origin, but those seen in our world are from a material origin; and things from a spiritual origin affect the senses of the angels because their senses are spiritual, as those from a material origin affect the senses of men because they are material. For spiritual things are homogeneous with spiritual beings, and material things are homogeneous with material beings. It is said that they are from a spiritual origin because they exist from the Divine that proceeds from the Lord as a sun; and the Divine proceeding from the Lord as a sun is spiritual.

For that light is the Divine wisdom, and is called the Divine truth, and that heat is the Divine love, and is called the Divine good, consequently that light inwardly enlightens the understanding of angels, and that heat inwardly fills the will of angels with the good of love. From that origin are all things that exist in the heavens; and they appear in forms like those in our world in its three kingdoms, as has been said above. Their appearing in such forms is according to the order of creation, which is that when the things pertaining to the wisdom of angels and to their love descend into the lower sphere in which angels are as to their bodies and their bodily sensations they are manifested in such forms and types. These are correspondences. [3] This has been said to make known what is meant by the sign that John declares that he saw, also by the sign mentioned in the first and third verses of the twelfth chapter, namely, that it means revelation by such things as exist in heaven from a Divine spiritual origin, and thus contain in them Divine arcana; here arcana respecting the state of the church just before the last judgment. For seven angels were seen “with seven golden vials, clothed in linen clean and bright, and girded about the breasts with golden girdles”; there was also seen “a glassy sea mingled with fire”; also “those who had victory over the beast, having harps”; there was also seen “the temple of the Tabernacle of the testimony”; and the songs in which they glorified the Lord were heard; all these are called the “sign” that he saw, because they were significative. But the things signified by them can be seen only by correspondences; and because they contain Divine arcana, they cannot be seen unless the Lord reveals them. [4] It is called a “sign from heaven,” which means revelation by the Lord. It is said “by the Lord” because heaven is the Lord.

Since, then, heaven is from the angels, and angels are angels from the Lord, it follows that heaven is the Lord. 927. Great and wonderful, signifies from Divine omnipotence and providence. This is evident from the signification of “great” as being in reference to the Lord His Divine omnipotence; also from the signification of “wonderful,” as being in reference to the Lord His Divine providence. For when man looks to what is great in the Lord he looks to His Divine omnipotence, and when he looks to what is wonderful in the Lord he looks to His Divine providence. Moreover, what follows respecting the salvation of the good and the condemnation of the evil is all of the Divine omnipotence and providence. 928.

How the evils and falsities that have wholly devastated the church were made manifest by the Lord is described in what follows in this chapter from the fifth to the eighth verse. [2] That the church has been devastated as to all goods and truths can be seen from this, that the Christian Church has been divided from its beginning into two churches, one of which is depicted in Revelation by the dragon and the two beasts; and the other by the harlot sitting on the scarlet beast, and by Babylon. That which is depicted by the dragon and its two beasts is the church with the Reformed; and that which is depicted by the harlot and by Babylon is the church with the papists. The church with the Reformed has been devastated by faith alone; and the church with the papists by dominion over the souls of men, and over heaven. The devastation of this church as to all goods and truths therefrom is treated of in the seventeenth and eighteenth chapters; and the devastation of the church with the Reformed is described in the twelfth and thirteenth chapters, and further in the sixteenth chapter by “the seven angels having vials full of the anger of God.” [3] That both churches have been devastated in respect to all goods and truths by evils and falsities can be clearly seen from the fact that scarcely anyone at this day knows that God is one and that He is the Lord, or knows what love to the Lord is, or what charity towards the neighbor is, and therefore what good works are, or even what faith is in its essence, and that what is called faith is not faith; also what conscience is, what free will is, what regeneration is, what spiritual temptation is, what baptism is, what the Holy Supper is, what heaven and hell are, what the Word is, and many other things.

This is evident from the signification of “the anger of God,” as being when there is no longer any good or truth, but only evil and falsity; and because these are against the Lord and against heaven they are called “the anger of God”; and this, too, is why the last time of the church, and the last judgment at that time, are called “the day of God’s anger, wrath, and vengeance” (see above, n. 413); also why anger is attributed to the Lord, when in fact it belongs to the evil; for all evil contains anger against the Lord, and consequently against good and truth, which are from the Lord. The “anger” is said to be “consummated,” because “consummation” signifies the end of the church or when there is no longer any good or truth, but only evil and falsity. (See above, n. 397; also why the last judgment does not come until the consummation has been accomplished, n. 624a, 911a.) Every church in its beginning is in good and from that in truths, or in charity and from that in faith; but afterwards it is in faith and from that in charity, and finally in faith separated from charity. When it is in charity and from that in faith the church is spiritual; when it is in faith and from that in charity the church is rational; and when it is in faith separated from charity it is natural; and a merely natural church is no church, for the merely natural man has regard only for self and the world, and no regard for the Lord and heaven—the latter is on his lips only, the former in his heart—and when the church is such then it has been consummated. 930.

Truths in general, or the generals of truth, are such truths as are in the sense of the letter of the Word, and the sense of the letter of the Word is natural, and everything natural is a general receptacle of spiritual things. For nothing in the nature of the world, or nothing natural, is possible that does not exist from the spiritual; for the natural is formed from the spiritual, as an effect out of its effecting cause. And as thousands of things that are spiritual effect and form one natural thing, so this one, as it is the container of the thousands, is a general thing. [2] Such also is the Word in the sense of the letter in its relation to the Word in the spiritual sense; and as the spiritual sense of the Word is in the natural sense, and in it shines through before the angels, so the Word as to the generals of truth transparent from spiritual truths is signified by “the glassy sea.” “Glassy sea” has the same signification elsewhere in Revelation: And in sight of the throne a glassy sea like crystal (4:6). Also: The city New Jerusalem, as well as the street of the city, appeared like pure gold, similar to transparent glass (Rev. 21:18, 21). For that “city” signifies the doctrine of the church, and “street” the truth of that doctrine; and the truths of that doctrine, because they are genuine truths, derive their light and their transparency from spiritual truths. It is this transparency that is signified by “glass” and by “crystal”: Also over the heads of the cherubim a firmament was seen like the appearance of a wonderful crystal (Ezek. 1:22). This signifies the spiritual Divine in heaven. That “the glassy sea” signifies the Word in the sense of the letter transparent from its spiritual sense can be seen also from the fact that near it were seen “them that had the victory over the beast”; and these signify those"

And them that have victory over the beast, signifies who have lived a life of charity, and thus have not falsified the Word. This is evident from the signification of “having victory over the beast,” as being to live a life of charity; for “the beast” signifies those who are in faith separated from charity, or what is the same, those who are in faith without good works, and who live according to that faith; consequently those who do not live that faith but the faith of charity “have victory over the beast,” for they fight against that faith in their life; and as they come off victors they receive the reward of victory after their life in the world. As “the beast” signifies also the confirmation from the Word of faith separate, and thus falsification of the Word, so “to have the victory over the beast” signifies also not to have falsified the Word. (That “the two beasts” of the dragon treated of in chapter 13 signify faith separated from the goods of life, also falsification of the Word to confirm that faith, may be seen above, n. 773, 815a .) THE GOODS OF CHARITY As faith separated from the goods of charity, which are good works, also the faith that is from charity, have been treated of in the explanations of two preceding chapters (the twelfth and thirteenth), the goods of charity shall be treated of in the explanations of this and the following chapter. What is meant by the goods of charity or good works is at this day unknown to most in the Christian world, because of the prevalence of the religion of faith alone, which is faith separated from the goods of charity. For if only faith contributes to salvation, and goods of charity contribute nothing, the idea that these goods may be left undone has place in the mind. But some who believe that good works should be done do not know what good works are, thinking that good works are merely giving to the poor and doing good to the needy and to widows and orphans, since such things are mentioned and seemingly commanded in the Word.

But what is meant in the Word by good works shall be told in order in what follows. 933. And over his image and over his mark and over the number of his name, signifies and that have not acknowledged the doctrine of faith separated from charity, or any quality of it. This is evident from the signification of “the beast,” whose “image,” “mark,” and “number of name,” are here mentioned, as being faith separated from charity, or faith without good works (see above, n. 773, 815a ); also from the signification of “his image,” as being the doctrine of that faith (see n. 827a); also from the signification of “mark,” as being the acknowledgment and confession of that faith (see n. 838); also from the signification of “the number of his name,” as being what is like it as to life and as to faith, thus its quality, also as being falsities in the whole complex (see n. 841, 845, 847). So “the image, mark, and number of his name,” signify, when taken together, not acknowledging and confessing faith separated as to its doctrine, and as to any quality of it. “To have victory over these” signifies to reject them in life and doctrine, which is effected by combat against the falsities that the followers of that faith offer in opposition. (Continuation) [2] It has been said in the previous article that at this day it is scarcely known what is meant by charity, and thus by good works, unless it be giving to the poor, enriching the needy, doing good to widows and orphans, and contributing to the building of temples, hospitals, and lodging houses; and yet whether such works are done by man and for the sake of reward is not known; for if they are done by man they are not good, and if for the sake of reward they are meritorious; and such works do not open heaven, and thus are not acknowledged as goods in heaven. In heaven no works are regarded as good except such as are done by the Lord with man, and yet the works that are done by the Lord with man appear in"

For the works done by the Lord with man are done by man as if by himself; and unless they are done as if by himself they do not conjoin man to the Lord, thus they do not reform him. That man ought to do goods as if by himself may be seen above (n. 616, 864, 911c). (Continued in the following article.) 934. Standing by the glassy sea, signifies because they have been in truths from the Word. This is evident from the signification of “the glassy sea,” as being the generals of truth from the Word transparent from spiritual truths (see above, n. 931); so “standing by it” signifies to be in truths. They were seen “standing by the glassy sea” because those who live the life of charity and reject the doctrine of faith separated remain in the truths of the sense of the letter of the Word, and do not pervert and falsify them. As for example, where “doing” and “working,” also “deeds” and “works” are mentioned in the Word they do not include these in faith as though they were concealed in it, but they actually will and do them; for they know that without them faith is not faith, and that faith is only so far faith as works are rightly conjoined with it; consequently to include these in faith or to separate them from it they condemn as a heresy. This makes clear that such “stand by the glassy sea,” that is, are in truths from the Word. (Continuation) [2] It was said of works in the preceding article that those done by man are not good, but only those done by the Lord with man. But for works to be done by the Lord, and not by man, two things are necessary: first, the Lord’s Divine must be acknowledged, also that He is the God of heaven and earth even as to the Human, and that every good that is good is from Him; and secondly, that man must live according to the commandments of the Decalog by abstaining from those evils that are there forbidden, that is, from worshiping other gods, from profaning the name of God, from thefts, from adulteries, from murders, from false witness, from coveting the possessions and property of others. These two things are requisite that the works done by man may be good. The reason"

This is what is meant by the Lord’s words to the rich man: Who asked Him about eternal life, and said that he had kept the commandments of the Decalog from his youth; whom the Lord is said to have loved, and to have taught that one thing was lacking to him, that he should sell all that he had and take up the cross (Matt. 19:16–22; Mark 10:17–22; Luke 18:18–23). “To sell all that he had” signifies that he should relinquish the things of his religion, which were traditions, for he was a Jew, and also should relinquish the things that were his own (proprium), which were loving self and the world more than God, and thus leading himself; and “to follow the Lord” signifies to acknowledge Him only and to be led by Him; therefore the Lord also said, “Why callest thou Me good? there is none good but God only.” “To take up his cross” signifies to fight against evils and falsities, which are from what is one’s own. 935. Having the harps of God, signifies the glorification of the Lord from spiritual affection. This is evident from the signification of “harps,” as being confessions and glorifications (see above, n. 323, 856). Therefore “the harps of God” mean confessions and glorifications of the Lord from spiritual affection. This is the signification of “the harps of God,” because spiritual affections, which are the affections of truth, were expressed by stringed instruments; while celestial affections, which are the affections of good, were expressed by wind instruments (see above, n. 323a, 326a ). (Continuation) [2] The previous article treated of the two things necessary that works may be good, namely, that the Divine of the Lord be acknowledged, and that the evils forbidden in the Decalog be shunned as sins.

The first commandment, “Thou shalt not worship other gods,” includes not loving self and the world; for he that loves self and the world above all things worships other gods; for everyone’s god is that which he loves above all things. The second commandment, “Thou shalt not profane the name of God,” includes not to despise the Word and doctrine from the Word, and thus the church, and not to reject these from the heart, for these are God’s “name.” The fifth commandment, “Thou shalt not steal,” includes the shunning of frauds and unlawful gains, for these also are thefts. The sixth commandment, “Thou shalt not commit adultery,” includes having delight in adulteries and having no delight in marriages, and in particular cherishing filthy thoughts respecting such things as pertain to marriage, for these are adulteries. The seventh commandment, “Thou shalt not kill,” includes not hating the neighbor nor loving revenge; for hatred and revenge breathe murder. The eighth commandment, “Thou shalt not bear false witness,” includes not to lie and blaspheme; for lies and blasphemies are false testimonies. The ninth commandment, “Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s house,” includes not wishing to possess or to divert to oneself the goods of others against their will. The tenth commandment, “Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s wife, his man servants,” and so on, includes not wishing to rule over others and to subject them to oneself, for the things here enumerated mean the things that are man’s own. Anyone can see that these eight commandments contain the evils that must be shunned, and not the goods that must be done. 936. Verse 3. And they were singing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, signifies the acknowledgement and confession of the commandments in the Word of both Testaments; also the acknowledgment and confession of the Lord’s Divine in His Human. This is evident from the signification of “singing a song,” as being confession from acknowledgement and from joy of heart (see n. 326, 857); also from the signification of “Moses,” as being the Word of the Old Testament (of which presently); also from the signification of “the Lamb,” as being the Lord as to the Divine truth (see n. 297, 343, 460, 482), thus as to the Word, for that is the Divine truth; but here, since it is said “Moses and the"

It is evident from what follows in these two verses that “the song of Moses and of the Lamb” signifies the acknowledgment of the commandments in the Word of both Testaments, also the acknowledgment of the Divine in the Lord’s Human, since these are what they were singing, or what constituted their song. In the first verse the Lord’s works and His ways, which signify His commandments, are glorified. In the following verse the Lord is glorified, and an injunction that all must fear Him, because He alone is holy; and as these are the subjects of the two songs, and “songs” signify acknowledgments and confessions of these things, it is clear that “they were singing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb,” signifies the acknowledgment and confession of the commandments in the Word of both Testaments, also the acknowledgment and confession of the Lord’s Divine in His Human. Moreover, by these two victory is had over the beast (the subject here treated of), namely, by keeping the commandments and by acknowledging the Lord’s Divine. Without these two the beast conquers. (Continuation) [2] In the previous article the evils that must be shunned were enumerated from the Decalog. But many, I know, think in their heart that no one can shun these of himself, because man is born in sins and has therefore no power of himself to shun them. But let such know that anyone who thinks in his heart that there is a God, that the Lord is the God of heaven and earth, that the Word is from Him, and is therefore holy, that there is a heaven and a hell, and that there is a life after death, is able to shun these evils. But he is not able who despises these truths and casts them out of his mind, and not at all he who denies them. For how can one who never thinks about God think that anything is a sin against God? And how can one who never thinks about heaven, hell, and the life after death, shun evils as sins? Such a man does not know what sin is. Man is placed in the middle between heaven and hell. Out of heaven goods unceasingly flow in, and out of hell evils unceasingly flow in; and as man is between he has freedom to think what is good or to think what is evil.

So far, therefore, as man from this freedom has the thought and desire to shun evils because they are sins, and prays to the Lord for help, so far the Lord removes them and gives man the ability to refrain from them as if of himself, and then to shun them. [3] Everyone is able from natural freedom to shun these same evils because of their being contrary to human laws; this every citizen of a kingdom does who fears the penalties of the civil law, or the loss of life, reputation, honor, wealth, and thus of office, gain, and pleasure; even an evil man does this. And the life of such a man appears exactly the same in external form as the life of one who shuns these evils because they are contrary to the Divine laws; but in internal form it is wholly unlike it. The one acts from natural freedom only, which is from man; the other acts from spiritual freedom, which is from the Lord; both acting from freedom. When a man is able to shun these same evils from natural freedom, why is he not able to shun them from spiritual freedom, in which he is constantly held by the Lord, provided he thinks to will this because there is a hell, a heaven, a life after death, punishment, and reward, and prays to the Lord for help? [4] Let it be known that every man when he is beginning the spiritual life because he wishes to be saved, fears sins on account of the punishments of hell, but afterwards on account of the sin itself, because it is in itself heinous, and finally on account of the truth and good that he loves, thus for the Lord’s sake. For so far as anyone loves truth and good, thus the Lord, he so far turns away from what is contrary to these, which is evil. All this makes clear that he that believes in the Lord shuns evils as sins; and conversely, he that shuns evils as sins believes; consequently to shun evils as sins is the sign of faith. 937. That “Moses” signifies the Word of the Old Testament can be seen from certain passages in the Word in which he is mentioned.

[2] That which was from the Lord through Moses was attributed to Moses because of the representation; therefore the terms “the law of Moses” and “the law of the Lord” are both used in Luke: When the days of their purification according to the law of Moses were fulfilled, they brought Him up to Jerusalem (as it is written in the law of the Lord, that every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord), that they might offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord, A pair of turtle doves or two young pigeons (2:22–24, 39).

It is said “in the mist of a cloud,” because a “cloud” signifies the Word in the letter.

He veiled his face when he spoke with the people because the internal of the Word was covered and thus obscured to that people to protect them from anything of its light. [5] Because Moses represented the Lord as to the historical Word, and Elijah the Lord as to the prophetical Word, when the Lord was transfigured Moses and Elijah were seen talking with Him (Matt. 17:3). When the Lord’s Divine was manifested in the world, only those who signified the Word could talk with the Lord, because discourse with the Lord is by means of the Word. (That Elijah represented the Lord as to the Word, see n. 624e.) [6] Because Moses and Elijah taken together represented the Word, where Elijah is spoken of as the one sent before the Lord, both are mentioned, in Malachi: Remember ye the law of Moses My servant, which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel, the statutes and the judgments. Lo, I send to you Elijah the prophet, before the great and terrible day of Jehovah comes (4:4–6).

The goods of heaven and the church are the works of the Lord because heaven is heaven, and the church is a church from the good of love to the Lord and from the good of love towards the neighbor (see the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 13–19). (Continuation) [2] A previous article (n. 936) treated of refraining from evils from spiritual freedom, in which every man is held by the Lord. But as all the evils into which man is born derive their roots from the love of ruling over others and from the love of possessing the goods of others, and all the delights of man’s own life flow forth from these two loves, and all evils are from them, so the loves and delights of these evils belong to man’s own life. And since evils belong to the life of man, it follows that man from himself can by no means refrain from them, for this would be from his own life to refrain from his own life. The ability to refrain from them of the Lord is therefore provided, and that he may have this ability the freedom to think that which he wills and to pray to the Lord for help is granted him. He has this freedom because he is in the middle between heaven and hell, consequently between good and evil. And being in the middle he is in equilibrium; and he who is in equilibrium is able easily and as of his own accord to turn himself the one way or the other; and the more so because the Lord continually resists evils and repels them, and raises man up and draws him to Himself. And yet there is combat, because the evils which belong to man’s life are stirred up by the evils that unceasingly rise up from hell; and then man must fight against them, and, indeed, as if of himself; if he does not fight as if of himself the evils are not separated. 939.

(Continuation) [2] It is known that man’s interior must be purified before the good that he does is good; for the Lord says: Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first the inside of the cup and of the platter, that the outside may be clean also (Matt. 13:26). Man’s interior is purified only as he refrains from evils, in accordance with the commandments of the Decalog. So long as man does not refrain from these evils and does not shun and turn away from them as sins, they constitute his interior, and are like an interposed veil or covering, and in heaven this appears like an eclipse by which the sun is obscured and light is intercepted; also like a fountain of pitch or of black water, from which nothing emanates but what is impure. That which emanates therefrom and that appears before the world as good is not good, because it is defiled by evils from within, for it is pharisaical and hypocritical good. This good is good from man and is meritorious good. It is otherwise when evils have been removed by a life according to the precepts of the decalog. [3] Now since evils must be removed before goods can become goods, the Ten Commandments were the first of the Word, being promulgated from Mount Sinai before the Word was written by Moses and the Prophets. And these do not set forth goods that must be done, but evils that must be shunned. For the same reason these commandments are the first things to be taught in the churches; for they are taught to boys and girls in order that man may begin his Christian life with them, and by no means forget them as he grows up; although he does so. The same is meant by these words in Isaiah:"

And when you multiply prayer I will not hear. Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before Mine eyes; cease to do evil. Then though your sins be as scarlet they shall be white as snow; though they be red as purple they shall be as wool (1:11–19). “Sacrifices,” “meal offerings,” “incense,” “new moons,” and “feasts,” also “prayer,” mean all things of worship. That these are wholly evil and even abominable unless the interior is purified from evils is meant by “Wash you, make you clean, put away the evil of your doings, and cease to do evil.” That afterwards they are all goods is meant by the words that follow. 940. Just and true are Thy ways, signifies that all the truths of heaven and the church are from Him. This is evident from the signification of “ways,” as being truths (see n. 97); so in reference to the Lord they signify all the truths of heaven and the church. It is said that the ways are “just and true,” because truths that are the Lord’s and are from the Lord are from good, and thus are good; for “just,” in the Word, is predicated of good. “Ways” signify truths because truths like ways lead man; therefore “ways” signify truths leading. This signification of “ways” is derived from the spiritual world, where all walk in ways according to their truths. Ways in that world are not prepared and directed from one place to another, as the ways in our world are; but they are opened to each one according to his truths, and these ways are such that he alone, and no one who is in other truths can see them. These ways lead them to the places whither they are to go, as towards the societies with which they are to be conjoined, or from which they are to be separated, and finally to the society where they are to remain. (Continuation) [2] When man’s interior is purified from evils by his refraining from them and shunning them because they are sins, the internal which is above it, and which is called the spiritual internal, is opened. This communicates with heaven; consequently man is then admitted into heaven and is conjoined to the Lord. There are two internals with man, one beneath and the other above. While"

This may be called for the sake of distinction the interior. But the internal that is above is that into which man comes after death when he enters heaven. All angels of heaven are in this internal, for it is spiritual. This internal is opened to the man who shuns evils as sins; but it is kept closed to the man who does not shun evils as sins. [3] This internal is kept closed to the man who does not shun evils as sins, because the interior, that is, the natural internal, until man has been purified from sins, is a hell; and so long as there is a hell there heaven cannot be opened; but as soon as hell has been removed it is opened. But let it be known that in the measure in which the spiritual internal and heaven are opened to man, the natural internal is purified from the hell that is there. This is not done at once, but successively by degrees. All this makes clear that man from himself is hell, and that man is made a heaven by the Lord, consequently that he is snatched out of hell by the Lord, and raised up into heaven to the Lord, not immediately, but mediately. The means are the commandments just mentioned, by which the Lord leads him who wishes to be led. 941. Thou King of saints, signifies because He is the Divine truth. This is evident from the signification of “king,” when said of the Lord as being the Divine truth (see n. 29, 31, 553, 625); also from the signification of “saints,” as being those who are in Divine truths from the Lord (see n. 204). Because the Divine truth proceeds from the Lord He is the Divine truth, since that which proceeds from anyone is himself. This may be illustrated from the angels, from whom a spiritual sphere proceeds, which is from the affection of their life; that same affection that is in them proceeds or is spread abroad to a distance from them, and by this others can recognize what they are and where they are. And as the sphere that proceeds from them is the same as the affection of their life that is in them, they are themselves their own sphere or proceeding affection. But from the Lord as a sun the Divine which fills the whole heaven and which makes heaven proceeds; and this Divine is called the Divine truth. From this it is clear that the Lord is the Divine truth."

He is enlightened especially when he reads the Word, because the Lord is in the Word, and the Word is the Divine truth, and the Divine truth is light to angels. Man is enlightened in the rational, for this directly underlies the spiritual internal, and receives light from heaven and transfers it into the natural when it is purified from evils, filling it with the knowledges of truth and good, and adapting to them the knowledges (scientiae) that are from the world, for the sake of confirmation and agreement. Thus man has a rational, and thus he has an understanding. He is deceived who believes that man has a rational and an understanding before his natural has been purified from evils, for the understanding is seeing the truths of the church from the light of heaven; and the light of heaven does not flow into those not purified. And as the understanding is perfected the falsities of religion and of ignorance and all fallacies are dispersed. 942. Verse 4. Who shall not fear Thee, O Lord, signifies the worship of the Lord from the good of love. This is evident from the signification of “fearing the Lord,” as being to worship Him. It means “from the good of love,” because it is added, “who shall not glorify Thy Name?” which signifies worship from truths that are from that good. These two are meant, because all worship of the Lord is from the good of love by means of truths. Good fears the Lord, and truths glorify Him. Worship from the good of love means worship by those who are in the good of life; with others worship from the good of love is not given. Moreover, true worship consists in a life according to the Lord’s commandments, and to do the Lord’s commandments is to love Him. (What further is meant by “fearing the Lord” may be seen above, n. 696.)

The first affection then granted is the affection of truth; the second is the affection of good; and the third is the affection of bringing forth fruit. For when a man has been admitted into heaven and into its light and heat he is like a tree growing from its seed. His first budding forth is from enlightenment; his blossoming before the fruit is from the affection of truth; the putting forth of fruit that follows is from the affection of good; the multiplication of itself again into trees is from the affection of producing fruit. The heat of heaven, which is love, and the light of heaven, which is the understanding of truth from that love, bring forth in subjects of life things like those that the heat of the world and its light bring forth in subjects not of life. That like things are brought forth is from correspondence. But in both cases the production is effected in springtime; and springtime in man is when he enters heaven, which is effected when his spiritual internal is opened; before that it is the time of winter to him. 943. And glorify Thy name, signifies the worship of the Lord from truths from that good. This is evident from the signification of “glorifying the Lord’s name,” as being to worship Him from truths that are from good. For “the Lord’s name” signifies all things by which He is worshiped (see above, n. 102, 135, 696a, 815c); and “to glorify Him,” or “to give glory to Him,” signifies to live according to His Divine truths (see n. 874); and to live according to His Divine truths is to worship Him, as has been said in the article just preceding. (Continuation) Man has the affection of truth when he loves truth and turns away from falsity. He has the affection of good when he loves good uses and turns away from evil uses. He has the affection of bringing forth fruit when he loves to do goods and to be serviceable. All heavenly joy is in these affections and from them, and this joy cannot be described by comparisons, for it is supereminent and eternal. 944.

And as this proceeds from the Lord it is Himself; for that which proceeds is from that which is in Him, and therefore it is Himself. This is why the Lord is the Divine good itself and the Divine truth itself. [2] It is the same as with the heat and light that proceed from the sun in the world, or from a flame of fire. The heat and light are from the sun, for they are from what is in the sun; in the sun is pure fire; this fire outside the sun is heat decreasing as the distance from the sun increases; and light is its modification or interior action in substances that are outside the sun, but are also from its fire. These substances in which these exist and take place are called atmospheres. From an analogous correspondence a conclusion may be formed respecting the heat and light that proceed from the Lord as a sun in heaven. The Lord there as a sun is the Divine love; and the heat proceeding therefrom is the Divine good; and the light proceeding therefrom is the Divine truth. The heat that proceeds, which is the Divine good, is the Divine love in its extension; and the light that proceeds, which is the Divine truth, is a modification or interior action of this in substances that are outside of Him. These substances, in which this modification takes place, are the spiritual atmospheres, from which the angels breathe and live. [3] As like things in the world are analogous correspondences, so “fire” signifies in the Word love, “heat” the Divine good, and “light” the Divine truth. The difference is that as the heat and light of heaven vivify spiritual essences, so the heat and light of the world vivify natural essences. And yet the heat and light of the world do not vivify from themselves, but from the heat and light of heaven, thus from the Lord. All this has been said to make known that the Lord is the Divine good itself and the Divine truth itself; thus He only is holy.

Wherefore all the nations shall come and worship before Thee, signifies that all who are in the good of love and in truths therefrom will acknowledge His Divine. This is evident from the signification of “nations,” as being those who are in the good of love and in truths therefrom (see n. 175, 331, 625); also from the signification of “worship” (adorare) as being to acknowledge in heart and to worship (colere) (see n. 790a, 805a, 821a). It is evident that such only are meant by “all nations,” for there are also those who will not acknowledge the Lord. (Continuation) When a man is in that state he is raised up from what is his own (proprium) for a man is in what is his own when he is only in the natural external, but he is raised up from what is his own when he is in the spiritual internal. This raising up from what is his own man perceives only by this, that he does not think evils, and that he turns away from thinking them, and takes delight in truths and in good uses. And yet if such a man advances further into that state he perceives influx by a kind of thought; but he is not withheld from thinking and willing as if from himself, for this the Lord wills for the sake of reformation. Nevertheless, man should acknowledge that nothing of good or of truth therefrom is from himself, but all is from the Lord. 946.

This is evident from the signification of “judgments,” as being Divine truths (of which presently); also from the signification of “made manifest,” as being to be revealed. That Divine truths are revealed at the end of the church, and that they have been revealed, will be shown in what follows in this chapter, because this is there treated of. “Judgments” signify Divine truths because the laws of government in the Lord’s spiritual kingdom are called “judgments”; while the laws of government in His celestial kingdom are called “justice.” For the"

This is why “judgment” and “justice” are mentioned in the Word, in the following passages. In Isaiah: Of peace there shall be no end upon the throne of David, to establish it, and to uphold it in judgment and in justice from henceforth and to eternity (9:7). This is said of the Lord and His kingdom. His spiritual kingdom is signified by “the throne of David”; and because this kingdom is in Divine truths from Divine good it is said, “in judgment and in justice.” In Jeremiah: I will raise unto David a righteous Branch, and He shall reign King, and He shall act intelligently, and shall do judgment and justice (23:5). This, too, is said of the Lord, and of His spiritual kingdom. And as this kingdom is in Divine truths from Divine good it is said, “He shall reign king, and shall act intelligently, and He shall do judgment and justice.” The Lord is called “King,” from Divine truth; and as Divine truth is also Divine intelligence it is said that “He shall act intelligently.” And as the Divine truth is from the Divine good it is said that “He shall do judgment and justice.” [2] In Isaiah: Jehovah is exalted, for He dwelleth on high, He hath filled Zion with judgment and justice (33:5). “Zion” means heaven and the church, where the Lord reigns by the Divine truth; and as all the Divine truth is from the Divine good it is said, “He hath filled Zion with judgment and justice.” In Jeremiah: I Jehovah doing judgment and justice in the earth; for in these things I am well pleased (9:24)."

In Isaiah: They ask of me the judgments of justice, they long for an approach unto God (58:2). The “judgments of justice” are Divine truths from the Divine good, as are “judgment and justice”; for the spiritual sense conjoins things that the sense of the letter separates. In Hosea: I will betroth thee unto Me forever; and I will betroth thee unto Me in justice and in judgment and in mercy and in truth (2:19, 20). This treats of the Lord’s celestial kingdom, which consists of those who are in love to the Lord; and as the Lord’s conjunction with such is comparatively like the conjunction of a husband with a wife, for so does the good of love conjoin, it is said, “I will betroth thee unto Me in justice and in judgment,” “justice” being put here in the first place, and “judgment” in the second, because those who are in the good of love to the Lord are also in truths; for they see truths from good. As “justice” is predicated of good, and “judgment” of truth, it is also said, “in mercy and in truth,” “mercy” belonging to good, because it is of love. [3] In David: Jehovah is in the heavens. Thy justice is like the mountains of God, and Thy judgments are like the great deep (Ps. 36:5, 6). “Justice” is predicated of the Divine good, and is therefore compared to “the mountains of God”; for “mountains of God” signify the goods of love (see above, n. 405a-f, 510, 850a); and “judgments” are predicated of Divine truths, and are therefore compared to “the great deep”; for “the great deep” signifies the Divine truth. From this it can now be seen that “judgments” signify Divine truths. [4] In many passages in the Word, “judgments,” “commandments,” and “statutes” are mentioned; and “judgments”"

That “judgments” signify civil laws, is evident from Exodus (21, 22, 23), where the things commanded are called “judgments” because according to them the judges gave judgments in the gates of the city; nevertheless they signify Divine truths, such as are in the Lord’s spiritual kingdom in the heavens, for they contain these in the spiritual sense; as can be seen from the explanation of them in the Arcana Coelestia (n. 8971–9103, 9124–9231, 9247–9348). That the laws given to the sons of Israel were called “judgments, “commandments,” and “statutes,” can be seen from the following passages. In Moses: I will speak unto thee all the commandments, the statutes, and the judgments, which thou shalt teach them, that they may do them (Deut. 5:31). ln the same: These are the commandments, the statutes, and the judgments, which Jehovah your God commanded to teach you (Deut. 6:1). In the same: Therefore thou shalt keep the commandments, the statutes, and the judgments, which I command thee this day, to do them (Deut. 7:11). In David: If his sons forsake My law and walk not in My judgments, if they profane My statutes and keep not My commandments, then will I visit their transgression with the rod (Ps. 89:30–32).

(Continuation) [5] It follows from this that when man shuns and turns away from evils as sins and is raised up into heaven by the Lord, he is no longer in what is his own (proprium), but in the Lord, and thus he thinks and wills goods. Again, since man acts as he thinks and wills, for every act of man proceeds from the thought of his will, it follows that when he shuns and turns away from evils, he does goods from the Lord and not from self; and this is why shunning evils is doing goods. The goods that a man then does are meant by good works; and good works in their whole complex are meant by charity. Man cannot be reformed unless he thinks, wills, and does as if from himself, since that which is done as if by the man himself is conjoined to him and remains with him, while that which is not done by the man as if from himself, not being received in any life of sense, flows through like ether; and this is why the Lord wills that man should not only shun and turn away from evils as if of himself, but should also think, will, and do as if of himself, and yet acknowledge in heart, that all these things are from the Lord.

And after these things I saw, and behold the temple of the tabernacle of the Testimony in heaven was opened, signifies the interior Divine truth in the Word revealed by the Lord. This is evident from the signification of “temple,” as being the Divine truth from the Lord (see n. 220, 391, 915); also from the signification of “the tabernacle of the Testimony,” as also being the Divine truth, but interior, for “tabernacle” and “temple” have a similar signification; but when it is said “the temple of the tabernacle of the Testimony” interior Divine truth is signified. “He saw that this was opened in heaven” means that this truth has been revealed. The interior Divine truth that was revealed means the Word in its internal sense; because the Word is the Divine truth, and the internal or spiritual sense is interior Divine truth. The “Testimony” means the law that was placed in the ark, which was therefore called “the ark of the Testimony.” (What “Testimony” further signifies in a broad and in a strict sense may be seen above, n. 10, 392, 635, 649, 749.) [2] What now follows in this chapter treats of the Word interiorly revealed, before the church has been wholly devastated. For the following chapter treats of its full devastation, which is described by “the seven angels having seven vials full of the anger of God,” and by their “casting them unto the earth.” The Word is revealed interiorly, that is, as to the spiritual sense, before the church has been fully devastated, because then the new church will be established into which those who are of the former church are invited; and for the new church interior Divine truth is revealed; and this could not have been revealed before for reasons that will be given in what follows. A like thing is now done as was done at the end of the Jewish Church; for at its end, which was when the Lord came into the world, the Word was opened interiorly; for when the Lord was in the world He revealed interior Divine truths that were to be for the use of a new church about to be established by Him and that did serve that church. For like reasons the Word has been opened interiorly at this day, and still more interior Divine truths have been revealed therefrom for the use of the new church, that will be called the New Jerusalem."

There have been several churches on our globe one after another. There was the most ancient, that was before the flood; there was the ancient, that was after the flood; then the Hebrew; and then the Israelitish; after this the Christian; and now the new church is beginning. Inmost Divine truths were revealed to those who were of the Most Ancient Church; more external Divine truths were revealed to those of the Ancient Church; and most external or ultimate Divine truths to the Hebrew Church, and afterwards to the Israelitish, with which church all Divine truth finally perished, for at last there was nothing in the Word that had not been adulterated. But after the end of the Israelitish Church interior Divine truths were revealed by the Lord for the Christian Church, and now still more interior truths for the church that is to come. These interior truths are such as are in the internal or spiritual sense of the Word. All this makes clear that there has been a progression of Divine truth from inmosts to ultimates, thus from wisdom to mere ignorance; and that now there is a progression of it from ultimates to interiors, thus from ignorance again to wisdom. [LIFE ACCORDING TO THE COMMANDMENTS] [4] Religion with man consists in a life according to the Divine commandments, which are contained in a summary in the Decalog.

All laws, civil, moral, and natural, prescribe that one must not steal, must not commit adultery, must not kill, must not bear false witness; and yet a man is not saved by shunning these evils from these laws alone, unless he also shuns them from spiritual law, thus unless he shuns them as sins. For with such a man there is religion, and a belief that there is a God, a heaven and a hell, and a life after death; with such a man there is a civil life, a moral life, and a natural life; a civil life because there is justice, a moral life because there is honesty, and a natural life because there is manhood. But he who does not live according to these commandments as a spiritual man is neither a civil man, nor a moral man, nor a natural man; for he is destitute of justice, of honesty, and even of manhood, since the Divine is not in these. For there can be nothing good in and from itself, but only from God; so there can be nothing just, nothing truly honest or truly human in itself and from itself, but only from God, and only when the Divine is in it. Consider whether anyone that has hell in him, or who is a devil, can do what is just from justice or for the sake of justice; in like manner what is honest, or what is truly human. The truly human is what is from order and according to order, and what is from sound reason; and God is order, and sound reason is from God. In a word, he who does not shun evils as sins is not a man. Everyone who makes these commandments the principles of his religion becomes a citizen and an inhabitant of heaven; but he who does not make them the principles of his religion, although in externals he may live according to them from natural, moral, and civil law, becomes a citizen and an inhabitant of the world, but not of heaven. [5] Most nations know these commandments, and make them the principles of their religion, and live according to them because God so wills and has commanded.

Because, therefore, such form for themselves no communication with heaven or conjunction with the Lord, but only with the world and with self, they cannot be saved. Consider in respect to yourself, when these external bonds have been taken away, as is done with every man after death, if there are no internal bonds, which are from fear and love of God, thus from religion, to restrain and hold you back, whether you would not rush, like a devil, into thefts, adulteries, murders, false witnesses, and lusts of every kind, from a love of these thus from a delight in them. That this is the case I have both seen and heard. 949. Verse 6. And there came out of the temple seven angels that had the seven plagues, signifies consequent manifestations of all the evils and falsities therefrom, and of all the falsities and evils therefrom that have devastated the church. This is evident from the signification of “angels,” as being manifestations (see above, n. 869, 878, 883); also from the signification of “seven,” as being all and wholly (see n. 257, 300); also from the signification of “plagues,” as being such things as destroy spiritual life, and thus the church, and these are lusts from an evil love and from falsities (see above, n. 584), consequently as being evils and the falsities therefrom, and falsities and the evils therefrom; also from the signification of “the temple,” as being the interior Word revealed (see the preceding article). All this makes clear that the words “there came out of the temple seven angels that had the seven plagues” signify that from the Word and from its spiritual sense are made manifest all the evils and falsities therefrom, and all the falsities and evils therefrom that have devastated the church.

The evils with the papists are evils from the love of ruling by means of the holy things of the church over all things of heaven and over all things of earth. That love is the fountain of all evils; and from those evils come falsities of every kind. But with the Reformed there are falsities and the evils therefrom; and these falsities spring from the principle of the justification and salvation of man by faith alone, or by faith without good works; and when good works are separated from faith, evil works take their place; consequently falsities and evils therefrom have devastated the church with the Reformed, as evils and falsities therefrom have with the papists. (Continuation) [3] So far as evils are removed as sins, so far goods flow in, and so far does man afterwards do goods, not from self, but from the Lord. As, first, so far as one does not worship other gods, and thus does not love self and the world above all things, so far the acknowledgement of God flows in from the Lord, and then he worships God, not from self but from the Lord. Second, so far as one does not profane the name of God, that is, so far as he shuns the lusts arising from the loves of self and of the world, so far he loves the holy things of the Word and of the church; for these are the name of God, and are profaned by the lusts arising from the loves of self and of the world. Third, so far as one shuns thefts, and thus shuns frauds and unlawful gains, so far sincerity and justice enter, and he loves what is sincere and just from sincerity and justice, and thus does what is sincere and just not from self but from the Lord. Fourth, so far as one shuns adulteries, and thus shuns unchaste and filthy thoughts, so far conjugial love enters, which is the inmost love of heaven, and in which chastity itself resides. Fifth, so far as one shuns murders, and thus shuns deadly hatreds and revenges that breathe slaughter, so far the Lord enters with mercy and love. Sixth, so far as one shuns false testimonies, and thus shuns lies and blasphemies, so far truth from the Lord enters.

Eighth, so far as one shuns the covetousness for the wives of others, their servants, etc., and thus shuns the love and consequent lusts of ruling over others (for the things enumerated in this commandment are what belong to man), so far love to the Lord enters. These eight commandments include the evils that must be shunned, but the two others, namely, the third and fourth, include certain things that must be done, namely, that the sabbath must be kept holy, and that parents must be honored. But how these two commandments should be understood, not by the men of the Jewish Church but by the men of the Christian Church, will be told elsewhere. 950. Clothed in linen clean and bright, signifies by means of the Divine truth or the Word from the spiritual sense. This is evident from the signification of “linen,” as being truth, and in reference to the Lord or the Word, as being the Divine truth. This is called “clean” because it is genuine, and is called “bright” from the light in heaven, which light is brightness, since from it all things there are bright. The Divine truth that proceeds from the Lord is what appears to the eyes of angels as light, for the reason that the Divine truth enlightens their understanding; and what enlightens the understanding of angels is light to their eyes. Such is the Divine truth in heaven, and such is the Word in its spiritual sense; while Divine truth on the earth is such as the Word is in the sense of the letter, in which there are few genuine truths like those in heaven, but there are appearances of truth; and these only can the natural man receive. Nevertheless in these appearances of truth genuine truths like those in heaven lie stored up; for these are what are contained in the spiritual sense of the Word. All this makes clear that the words “there came out of the temple angels clothed in linen clean and bright” signify that the evils and falsities that have devastated the church were made manifest by the Divine truth, or the Word from its spiritual sense. [2] There are many reasons why the spiritual sense of the Word has now been disclosed. First, because the churches in the Christian world have falsified all the sense of the letter of the Word, and this even to the destruction of the Divine truth in heaven, by which heaven has been closed up.

For through the Word there is the conjunction of man with the Lord, and thus with heaven. When the Word is falsified even to the destruction of its genuine truth the conjunction perishes, and man is separated from heaven. In order, therefore, that he may again be conjoined with heaven, Divine truth such as it is in heaven has been revealed; and this has been confirmed by the spiritual sense of the Word, in which is that Divine truth. The second reason is that the falsities that have inundated and devastated the church can be dissipated only by means of the genuine truth laid open in the Word. Falsities and the evils therefrom and evils and the falsities therefrom can be seen in no other way than from truths themselves. For so long as genuine truths are not present, falsities and evils appear as in a kind of light. This light they have from confirmations by reasonings from the natural man, and by the sense of the letter explained and applied according to the appearances before that man. But when genuine truths are present, then first falsities and evils appear; for the light of heaven, which is in genuine truths, dissipates the delusive light of falsities and turns it into darkness. The third reason is, that, by means of the Divine truths of the Word that are in its spiritual sense, the new church, which is meant by “the Holy Jerusalem” in Revelation, may be conjoined with heaven. For the Word is conjunction; but conjunction is effected only when man perceives the Word in a similar way as the angels perceive it. That “linen” signifies truth will be seen in the following article. (Continuation: The First Commandment) [3] “Thou shalt not make to thee other gods” includes not loving self and the world above all things; for that which one loves above all things is his god. There are two directly opposite loves, love of self and love to God, also love of the world and love of heaven. He who loves himself loves his own (proprium); and as a man’s own is nothing but evil he also loves evil in its whole complex; and he who loves evil hates good, and thus hates God. He who loves himself above all things sinks his affections and thoughts in the body, and thus in his own and from this he cannot be raised up by the Lord;"

He who is not in the light of heaven but in thick darkness, since he sees nothing of God, denies God and acknowledges as god either nature or some man, or some idol, and even aspires to be himself worshiped as a god. From this it follows that he who loves himself above all things worships other gods. The same is true, but in a less degree, of one who loves the world; for there cannot be so great a love of the world as of one’s own; therefore the world is loved because of one’s own, and for the sake of one’s own, because it is serviceable to it. The love of self means especially the love of domineering over others from the mere delight in ruling and for the sake of eminence, and not from the delight in uses and for the sake of the public good; while the love of the world means especially the love of possessing goods in the world from the mere delight in possession and for the sake of riches, and not from the delight in uses from these and for the sake of the good therefrom. These loves are both of them without limit, and rush on to infinity so far as opportunity is given. 951. As “the seven angels that had the seven last plagues,” signify the manifestation of the evils and falsities that have devastated the church, and as these are made manifest by means of the Divine truth in the Word, therefore those angels appeared “clothed in linen clean and bright”; for “linen clean and bright” signifies genuine truth. All angels appear clothed according to their functions; for the garments in which they go clothed correspond to their ministries, and in general to their interiors. The angels who are wise from Divine truth appear in white garments of muslin, lawn, or linen, because “muslin,” “lawn,” and “linen,” correspond to the truths in which they are; and for this reason Aaron and his sons had garments of linen in which they ministered. These are described in Moses: Thou shalt make for Aaron and his sons linen breeches to cover the flesh of their nakedness, from the loins even unto the thighs; these shall be upon them when they shall go into the Tent of meeting and when they come near unto the altar to minister in the holy place, that they bear not iniquity and die (Exod. 28:42, 43)."

He should put on the same garments when expiating the people (Lev. 16:32). Also when he took the ashes from the altar after the burnt offering (Lev. 6:10). [2] In like manner the priests were to minister in the new temple. In Ezekiel: When the priests the Levites, the sons of Zadok shall enter at the gates of the inner court they shall put on linen garments; no wool shall come upon them while they shall minister in the gates of the inner court and within; linen miters shall be upon their head and linen breeches shall be upon their loins (44:15, 17, 18). They put on linen garments when they ministered holy things, because all holy administration is effected by the Divine truth. For the priesthood in which Aaron and his sons officiated represented the Lord as to the Divine good; and this ministers all things by means of the Divine truth. Moreover, the Divine truth protects from falsities and evils, which are from hell; therefore it is said “that they bear not iniquity and die,” which signifies that otherwise falsities from hell would destroy them. These garments were called “garments of holiness,” because holiness is predicated of the Divine truth. As the garments of ministry were linen garments, the priests wore a linen ephod when they ministered, as is read of Samuel (1 Sam. 2:18), and of the priests whom Saul slew (1 Sam. 22:18), and of David when he went before the ark (2 Sam. 6:14). [3] Also of the Lord Himself in John: Jesus rose up from supper and laid aside His garments, and took a linen cloth and girded Himself, and poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples’ feet and to wipe them with the linen cloth with which He was girded (13:4, 5)."

[4] Besides these seven angels treated of in Revelation there have been other angels seen in linen garments; as: The angel who shall set a mark on the foreheads of the men who sigh; and who shall go in between the wheels of cherubim and take coals of fire and scatter them over the city (Ezek. 9:3, 4, 11; 10:2, 6, 7). Likewise the angel seen by Daniel, clothed in linen, whose loins were girt with gold of Uphas (Dan. 10:5; 12:6, 7). These appeared clothed in linen because girded for ministry. The angel who measured the new temple, whose appearance was like that of brass: Was seen to have a line of flax in his hand and a measuring reed (Ezek. 40:3). By “the measuring of the temple” there, is described the new church as to its quality; this is signified by the number of the measures; and as all the quality of the church is known by the Divine truth, therefore “a line of flax” was in his hand. [5] As “linen” signifies truth, and “a girdle” everything of it, for it is what embraces and includes all things, and as nothing of truth any longer remained with the sons of Israel, therefore: The prophet Jeremiah was commanded to buy himself a linen girdle, and to hide it in the cleft of a rock at the Euphrates; and at the end of many days it was spoiled and was profitable for nothing (Jer. 13:1–7)."

What is signified by its being “hidden in the cleft of a rock at the Euphrates and was there spoiled,” may be seen above (n. 569c). [6] “Linen” signifies the truth of the church also in Isaiah: A bruised reed He will not break, and smoking flax He will not extinguish, and He will bring forth judgment in truth (42:3). This was said of the Lord; and “the smoking flax,” that He will not extinguish signifies the small amount of truth from good with anyone. (The rest may be seen explained above, n. 627a.) “Linen” signifies also truth from the Word, especially the truth of the sense of its letter (Hos. 2:5, 9). [7] Moreover, it was a statute with the sons of Israel: That they should not wear a garment of wool and linen mixed together (Deut. 22:11). The reason was that “wool” signifies good and “linen” truth, also because man has communication with the societies of heaven by means of his garments; and there are societies that are in good and societies that are in truth; and man must not have communication with different societies at the same time, which would cause confusion. That this was the reason for this statute no one has heretofore known. But it has been granted me to know it from changing my garments; for when I have laid aside a linen garment those in the spiritual world who were in truths have complained that they could not be present; and when I again put on the garment the same spirits became present. That there is such correspondence with the very garments of man has not been known heretofore, and yet it can be seen from the passages cited above, namely, from what is said of the linen garments of Aaron and his sons, the linen ephod that the priests and David wore, the linen in which the angels appeared clothed, and the linen cloth with which the Lord girded Himself and wiped the disciples’ feet, also the other garments of Aaron and his sons, all of which were representative; also from the signification of garments in general, as"

Therefore this love is called by many the fire of life, and the incitement to great things. But it is to be known that so far as these two loves regard uses in the first place and self in the second they are good, while so far as they regard self in the first place and uses in the second they are evil, since man then does all things for the sake of self and consequently from self, and thus in every least thing he does there is self and what is his own, which regarded in itself is nothing but evil. But to regard uses in the first place and self in the second is to do good for the sake of the church, the country, society, and the neighbor; and the goods that man does to these for the sake of these are not from man but from the Lord. The difference between these two is like the difference between heaven and hell. Man does not know that there is such a difference, because from birth and thus from nature he is in these loves, and because the delight of these loves continually flatters and pleases him. [9] But let him consider that the love of ruling from the delight of ruling, and not from the delight of uses, is wholly devilish; and such a man may be called an atheist; for so far as he is in that love he does not in his heart believe in the existence of God, and to the same extent he derides in his heart all things of the church, and even hates and pursues with hatred all who acknowledge God, and especially those who acknowledge the Lord.

And girded about the breasts with golden girdles, signifies Divine spiritual good holding truths in order and connection. This is evident from the signification of “a golden girdle,” as being what holds in order and in connection, for a girdle or belt encloses the garments and holds them together. Truths are so held in order and connection because truths are signified by “garments,” and particularly by “linen garments.” Spiritual good is meant, because the “breast” which was girt about, and the “gold” of which the girdles were made, signify that good. What has been said above, that: The Son of man was seen in the midst of the lamp stands, girt about the paps with a golden girdle (Rev. 1:3), has a like signification, as may be seen explained above (n. 65).

When this thought is from hell man sees no otherwise than that nature is God, and that the inmost of nature is what is called the Divine.

Those are without that sense who do not regard the Word as holy, and to whom therefore the Divine truth therein is without light and power; while those who regard the Word as holy have that light and power. The reason is that such are conjoined with heaven through the spiritual sense, although they are not conscious of it.

For he wishes to see his God, and he is incapable of seeing Him otherwise than as Man. Thus did the ancients before Abraham and after him see God; thus do the nations in countries outside the church see God from an interior perception, especially those who are interiorly wise although not from knowledges; thus do all little children and youths and simple well-disposed adults see God; and thus do the inhabitants of all earths see God; for they declare that what is invisible, since it does not come into an idea, does not come into faith. The reason of this is that the man who shuns and turns away from evils as sins thinks from heaven; and the whole heaven, and everyone there, has no other idea of God than as that of Man; nor can he have any other idea, since the whole heaven is a man in the largest form, and the Divine that proceeds from the Lord is what makes heaven; consequently to think otherwise of God than according to that Divine form, which is the human form, is impossible to angels, since angelic thoughts pervade heaven. (That the whole heaven in the complex answers to one Man may be seen in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 51–86; and that the angels think according to the form of heaven, n. 200–212.) [5] This idea of God flows in from heaven with all in the world, and has its seat in their spirit; but it seems to be rooted out with those in the church who are in intelligence from what is their own, indeed so rooted out as to be no longer a possible idea; and this for the reason that they think of God from space. But when these become spirits they think otherwise, as has been made evident to me by much experience. For in the spiritual world an indeterminate idea of God is no idea of Him; consequently the idea there is determined to someone who has his seat either on high or elsewhere, and who gives answers. From the general influx which is from the spiritual world men have received ideas of God as Man variously according to the state of perception; and for this reason the triune God is with us called Persons; and in paintings in churches God the Father is represented as Man, the Ancient of Days. It is also from a general influx that men, both living and"

The same is true of many nations elsewhere, of the ancient peoples in Greece, in Rome, and in Asia, who had many gods, all of whom were regarded by them as men. This has been said to make known that there is an intuition, namely, in man’s spirit, to see God as Man. That is called an intuition which is from general influx. 956. And no one was able to enter into the temple, signifies that it is in obscurity before the understanding. This is evident from the signification of the “temple,” as being the Word (see above); therefore “not to enter the temple on account of the smoke” signifies that the Word is in obscurity before the understanding. The Word is in obscurity even so as not to be understood because in the end of the church there are no truths, and thus all things of the Word are falsified; therefore until genuine truths have been disclosed the Word is in obscurity before the understanding. (Continuation respecting the First Commandment) [2] As man from a general influx out of heaven sees in his spirit that God is Man, it follows that those who are of the church where the Word is, if they shun and turn away from evils as sins, see, from the light of heaven in which they then are, the Divine in the Lord’s Human, and the trine in Him, and Himself to be the God of heaven and earth. But those cannot see this who by intelligence from what is their own have destroyed in themselves the idea of God as Man; neither do they see from the trinity that is in their thought that God is one; they call Him one with the lips only. But those who have not been purified from evils, and therefore are not in the light of heaven, do not in their spirit see the Lord to be the God of heaven and earth; but in place of the Lord some other being is acknowledged; by some of these someone whom they believe to be God the Father; by others someone whom they call God because he is especially powerful; by others some devil whom they fear because he can bring evil upon them; by others nature, as in the world; and by others no God at all.

This is evident from the signification of “being consummated,” as meaning to be ended, but here to be rejected; also from the signification of “the seven plagues,” as being all the evils and falsities that have devastated the church (see above, n. 949); also from the signification of “the seven angels,” as being manifestation (see n. 949). Thus “till the seven plagues of the seven angels should be consummated” signifies until the evils and falsities that are made manifest are rejected. These words signify also until those who are in evils and falsities have been cast into hell, because they relate to the time before the last judgment was accomplished, and before the good had been separated from the evil, and the good had been raised up into heaven and the evil cast into hell, thus before the new heaven and new earth had been established. That “no one was able to enter into the temple till the seven plagues of the seven angels should be consummated” signifies that until that time the Word was in obscurity before the understanding. [2] But this arcanum must be more fully explained. The Divine truths that lie interiorly stored up in the Word could not be made manifest until after the last judgment had been accomplished; and for the reason that before that judgment the hells had prevailed, while since that judgment the heavens prevail; and man is placed in the middle between the hells and the heavens; consequently so long as the hells prevail the truth of the Word is either perverted or despised or rejected; but the reverse takes place when the heavens prevail.

The idea of God is the idea of the Lord and His Divine, for no other is the God of heaven and the God of earth, as He Himself teaches in Matthew: All authority has been given unto Me in heaven and on earth (28:18). But the idea of the Lord is more or less full and more or less clear; it is full in the inmost heaven, less full in the middle, and still less full in the ultimate heaven; therefore those who are in the inmost heaven are in wisdom, those who are in the middle in intelligence, and those who are in the ultimate in knowledge. The idea is clear in the angels who are at the center of the societies of heaven; and less clear in those who are round about, according to the degrees of distance from the center.

Those who have a twofold idea, namely, of an invisible God and of a visible God in a human form, also have their place under the heavens, and are not received until they acknowledge one God, and Him visible. Some in the place of a visible God see as it were something aerial, and this because God is called a spirit. If this idea is not changed with them into the idea of Man, thus of the Lord, they are not accepted.

And I heard a voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels, signifies manifestation by the Divine truth from the Word of the evils and falsities that have devastated the church. This is evident from the signification of “a voice out of the temple,” as being the Divine truth from the Word, for a “voice” signifies the Divine truth (see above, n. 261, 668); and “the temple of the tabernacle of the Testimony,” out of which the voice came, signifies the Word in which is the Divine truth both natural and spiritual (n. 948). Also from the signification of “the seven angels,” as being manifestations (as has often been said above). And as “the seven vials” or “plagues” which they had signify the evils and falsities that have devastated the church, therefore manifestations of all the evils and falsities that have devastated the church are here signified by “the seven angels.” The manifestations of these are further treated of in the following verses. (Continuation: The Second Commandment) [2] In the preceding chapter the first commandment of the Decalog is treated of at the end of the several articles. In the following articles in this chapter the other commandments of the Decalog will be treated of; and here the second commandment, “Thou shalt not profane the name of God.\" In the first place, what is meant by “the name of God” shall be told, and afterwards what is meant by “profaning” it. “The name of God” means every quality by which God is worshiped. For God is in His own quality, and is His own quality. His essence is the Divine love, and His quality is the Divine truth therefrom united with the Divine good; thus with us on earth it is the Word; consequently it is said in John: The Word was with God, and God was the Word (1:1). Thence also, it is the doctrine of genuine truth and good from the Word; for worship is according to that."

He is called “Jehovah,” “Jehovah of Hosts,” “Lord,” “Lord Jehovih,” “God,” “Messiah or Christ,” “Jesus,” “Savior,” “Redeemer,” “Creator,” “Former,” “Maker,” “King,” and “the Holy One of Israel,” “the Rock” and “the Stone of Israel,” “Shiloh,” “Shaddai,” “David,” “Prophet,” “Son of God,” and “Son of man,” and so on. All these names are the names of the one God, who is the Lord; and yet where they occur in the Word they signify some universal Divine attribute or quality distinct from the other Divine attributes or qualities. So, too, where He is called “Father, Son, and Holy Spirit,” three are not meant, but one God; that is, there are not three Divines, but one, and this trine which is one is the Lord. [4] Since each name signifies some distinct attribute or quality, “to profane the name of God” does not mean to profane the name itself but His quality. “Name” signifies quality for the reason that in heaven everyone is named according to his quality; and the quality of God or the Lord is everything that is from Him by which He is worshiped. For this reason, since no Divine quality of the Lord is acknowledged in hell, the Lord cannot he named there; and in the spiritual world His names cannot be uttered by anyone except so far as His Divine is acknowledged; for there all speak from the heart, thus from love and consequent acknowledgment. 960a. Go pour out the vials of the anger of God into the earth, signifies the state of the devastated church. This is evident from the signification of “the vials of the anger of God,” as being the evils and falsities that have devastated the church; for “the vials of the anger of God” have the like signification as “the plagues” in the preceding chapter (15:6), where it is said that “seven angels went out from the temple having seven plagues,” “plagues” there signifying the evils and falsities therefrom and the falsities and evils therefrom that have devastated the church (see above, n. 949). “The anger of God” has a similar signification, for “the anger of God” is predicated of the evils and falsities that devastate the goods and truths of the church. It is evident also from the signification of “the earth,” as being the church (see above, n. 29, 304, 417a, 697,"

Nevertheless, it is so said in the sense of the letter of the Word because it so appears to men, and that sense being the ultimate sense consists of appearances. [2] These are called “vials” because vials are vessels, and vessels have a similar signification as their contents, as goblets, beakers, cups, with wine or other liquor in them; and as the incense vessels and censers for the incense, and many other vessels. The reason of this is that the sense of the letter of the Word is the ultimate sense of the Divine truth, and therefore consists of the ultimate things that are in nature; for upon ultimates interior or higher things are built and founded. That vials, goblets, cups, beakers, and platters are mentioned in place of their contents, and therefore have a similar signification, is evident from the Word, where they signify falsities from hell, and drunkenness or insanity therefrom. They also signify temptations; also truths from the Lord and wisdom therefrom. That they signify falsities from hell and insanity therefrom is evident from the following passages. In Jeremiah: Jehovah said, Take this cup of the wine of the anger of Jehovah out of My hand, and make all nations to whom I send thee to drink of it, that they may drink and stagger, and be mad because of the sword. When they refuse to take the cup out of thine hand to drink, thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith Jehovah of Hosts, Drinking ye shall drink (25:15, 16, 28). “Cup of wine” here signifies the falsity that is from hell; “to drink” signifies to appropriate to oneself; “to be mad” signifies to be spiritually insane, which takes place when falsity is called truth and truth falsity. The “nations” that shall drink signify the evil, and in an abstract sense evils; for many nations that were to drink are there enumerated, and yet nations are not meant, but the evils signified by them, and evils are what drink, that is, appropriate to themselves, falsities. That “cup of wine” signifies falsity is evident"

[3] In the same: Babylon is a cup of gold in the hand of Jehovah, making the whole earth drunken; the nations have drunk of her wine, therefore the nations are mad (Jer. 51:7). “Cup of gold” signifies falsity destroying good; “Babylon” signifies dominion over heaven and over the souls of men by means of the holy things of the church, from which dominion profane falsities flow forth; “to make the earth drunk” signifies to infatuate the church so that truth is not seen any more. “Wine” signifies that falsity. [4] In Ezekiel: Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister, therefore will I give her cup into thine hand. Thus saith the Lord Jehovih, Thou shalt drink of thy sister’s cup, which is deep and broad; thou shalt be for a laughing and derision; ample to contain, thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sadness, with the cup of devastation and desolation, with the cup of thy sister Samaria, which thou shalt drink and press out; and thou shalt break in pieces the shards thereof (23:31–34). This is said of Jerusalem, which signifies the celestial church as to doctrine; and Samaria, which is the “sister,” signifies here the spiritual church, also as to doctrine. For the Jewish nation represented the Lord’s celestial kingdom, and the Israelitish nation His spiritual kingdom. But here “Jerusalem and Samaria” signify the church devastated as to all good and truth. The full devastation of the church with the Jewish nation is described by “the sister’s cup, which is deep and broad,” and “they shall be filled with drunkenness and sadness,” and “they shall drink the cup and press it out, and break in pieces the shards thereof. “It is called “a cup of devastation and desolation,” because “devastation” is predicated of good, and “desolation” of truth.

In Lamentations: Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom; the cup shall pass through unto thee also; thou shalt be made drunken and shalt be uncovered (4:21). Here “cup” has the same signification.

He hath filled it with mixture, and hath poured it out thence; but the dregs of it all the wicked of the earth shall suck out and drink (Ps. 75:8). “Snares, fire, and brimstone,” signify falsities and evils leading astray, and “a wind of tempests” signifies vigorous assault upon truth.

It is so said because the natural man sees no otherwise than that God is angry with, punishes, condemns, and casts into hell, those who despise and blaspheme Him, in a word, who do not give glory to Him; and because to so think is natural, it is so said in the sense of the letter of the Word, which is natural. [8] So in other passages in Revelation: He that adored the beast shall drink of the wine of the anger of God, mixed with unmixed wine in the cup of His wrath (14:9, 10). Great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fury of His wrath (16:19). A woman having in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and of the uncleanness of her whoredom (17:4).

Jesus said in Gethsemane, If it be possible let this cup pass away from Me (Matt. 26:39, 42, 44; Mark 14:36; Luke 22:42). In these passages a “cup” or “goblet” plainly signifies temptations. So in Isaiah (51:17, 22), where it is also called “the cup of the anger of God” and “the cup of trembling.” [10] As “cup” has a similar signification as “wine,” and “wine” in the good sense signifies the Divine truth, therefore also this is what “cup” signifies in the following passages. In the Gospels: Jesus taking the cup and giving thanks, gave to the disciples, saying, All drink from it; for this is My blood, that of the new Testament (Matt. 26:27, 28; Mark 14:23, 24; Luke 22:17, 18). As the Lord’s “blood,” and likewise “wine,” signify the Divine truth that proceeds from Him, consequently the “cup” also, it is said therefore “this is My blood\"; and as it is by means of the Divine truth that the Lord is conjoined with the church, it is called “that of the new Testament or the new Covenant.” (That the Lord’s “blood” signifies the Divine truth may be seen n. 328a-c, 329a-f, 476, 748; and that “covenant” signifies conjunc-tion, n. 701.)

[12] In Mark: Whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in My name, because ye are Christ’s, he shall not lose his reward (9:41). “To give a cup of water to drink in My name, because ye are Christ’s,” signifies to teach truth from the love of truth, thus from the Lord, likewise to do it. The love of truth for the sake of truth is meant by “giving a cup of water in the name of the Lord\"; and “Christ” means the Lord as to the Divine truth. [13] In the Gospels: Woe unto you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites; for ye cleanse the outside of the cup and the platter, but within they are full from rapine and intemperance. Cleanse first the inside of the cup and of the platter, that the outside may become clean also (Matt. 23:25, 26; Luke 11:39). The Lord used the terms “cup” and “platter,” because the container has the same signification as the contents; thus the “cup” the same as “wine,” and the “platter” the same as “food.” “Wine” signifies the truth of the Word and of doctrine, and “food” the good of the Word and of doctrine. The natural man or the natural mind is inwardly purified when falsities and evils are removed, but it is not purified when they are not removed. For such as the interior is such does the exterior become, but the interior does not become such as the exterior is. For the interior flows into the exterior and disposes it to agreement with itself, but not the reverse."

When this is done heaven is closed and man is left to hell. For the Word is the only medium of conjunction of heaven with the church; therefore when the Word is cast out of the heart that conjunction is dissolved; and because man is then left to hell he no longer acknowledges any truth of the church. [15] There are two things by which heaven is closed to the men of the church. One is the denial of the Lord’s Divine, and the other is the denial of the holiness of the Word; and for this reason that the Lord’s Divine is the all of heaven, and the Divine truth, which is the Word in the spiritual sense, is what makes heaven; which makes clear that he who denies the one or the other denies that which is the all of heaven, and from which heaven is and exists, and thus deprives himself of communication and thence of conjunction with heaven. To profane the Word is the same as “blaspheming the Holy Spirit,” which is not forgiven to anyone, consequently it is said in this commandment that he who profanes the name of God shall not be left unpunished. 961. Verse 2. And the first went forth and poured out his vial upon the earth, signifies manifestation of the state of the church in general. This is evident from the signification of “pouring out the vial upon the earth,” as being manifestation of the state of the church in general, for “the seven angels” signify manifestation, and “the earth” the church, here as just above (n. 960a). 962. And there came a great5 and noxious sore, signifies evil works therein and consequent falsifications of the Word. This is evident from the signification of a “sore,” as being works that are done from man, thus that are from what is his own (proprium) and that are evil (of which presently); and as “great”6 is predicated of good, and in the contrary sense of evil, and “noxious” of what is falsified,"

For what is man’s own is that into which he is born, and which he afterwards carries into effect by means of his life. And as what is his own is thus from very birth composed of mere evils, man must be as it were created anew, that is, regenerated, that he may be in good and thus be received into heaven. When he is being regenerated the evils that are from his own are removed, and goods are implanted in their place, and this is effected by means of truths. That evil works and falsifications of truths are with those who acknowledge faith alone in doctrine, and confirm it in life is meant by what follows, namely, that “a great8 and noxious sore is on the men who have the mark of the beast and who adore his image.” [2] That “sores” signify works that are from one’s own can be seen from the Word where sores and wounds, also diseases of various kinds, as leprosies, fevers, ulcers, emerods, and many others, are mentioned. All of these correspond to the cupidities that arise from evil loves, and thus signify them. Moreover, what sores or wounds signify can be seen from the following passages. In Isaiah: From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it; wound, and bruise, and the fresh blow, they have not been pressed out nor bound up nor softened with oil. Your land is a solitude, your cities are burned with fire (1:6, 7). This describes that there is no good and consequently no truth in the church, but evil and falsity therefrom. “From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness” signifies that both natural and spiritual things which are the interiors of man and of his will have been destroyed. “Wound and bruise and fresh blow” signify the evils of the will, and the falsities of the thought therefrom continually increasing. Evils of the will are also evil works. “Not bound up nor softened with oil” signifies not amended by repentance and tempered by good. “Your land is a solitude, your cities are burned with fire” signifies that the church has been devastated as to all truth, and its doctrinals have been"

[3] In Hosea: Ephraim saw his disease, and Judah his wound; and Ephraim went to the Assyrian, and sent to king Jareb, and he was not able to heal you, neither shall he cure you of your wound (5:13). “Ephraim” signifies the church as to the understanding of truth, here as to the understanding of falsity; and “Judah” signifies the will of good, but here the will of evil; the “Assyrian” and “king Jareb” signify the rational perverted as to good and truth. This makes clear the signification of these words in the series, namely, that man is unable from self-intelligence to amend the falsities that spring from the evils of the will, “wound” meaning the evil of the will, which also is the evil of the life. [4] In David: Mine iniquities have passed over my head. My wounds have putrefied, they have wasted away because of my foolishness (Ps. 38:4, 5). Here, too, “wounds” stand for evils of the will, which are evil works, these are said “to putrefy and to waste away because of foolishness” when it is the delight of the will and of the thought therefrom to do them. [5] In Isaiah: In the day that Jehovah shall bind up the breach of His people, and shall heal the wound of their blow (30:26). “The breach of the people” signifies the falsity of doctrine; and “the wound of their blow” the evil of life; the reformation of doctrine by means of truths is signified by “Jehovah shall bind up the breach of His people\"; and reformation of the life by means of truths is signified by “He shall heal the wound of their blow.”"

This signifies that by means of truths from good, those who are in the good of charity will to amend the evils that spring from falsities; “robbers” mean those who have infused falsities from which come evils, in particular the Jews; “wounds” mean those evils; “oil” means the good of love; and “wine” the truth of the Word and of doctrine. (But this may be seen explained above, n. 376e, 444c.) [7] In Luke: Lazarus, full of sores, who was cast forth at the vestibule of the rich man (16:20, 21), signifies the nations that were in falsities from ignorance of truth, and thus were not in goods. From this he is said to have been “full of sores\"; “the rich man” at whose vestibule he was cast forth means the Jewish nation, which could have been in the truths from the Word that it possessed. [8] That “a boil breaking forth” was one of the plagues in Egypt is evident in Moses: Jehovah said unto Moses and unto Aaron, Take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses scatter it towards heaven before the eyes of Pharaoh; and it shall become dust upon all the land of Egypt. And they took ashes of the furnace, and Moses scattered it towards heaven, and it became a boil of pustules breaking forth on man and beast; and the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boil, because the boil was upon the magicians and upon all the Egyptians (Exod. 9:8–11). “Pharaoh and the Egyptians” signify the natural man obsessed by evils and falsities of every kind, and the natural man’s striving after dominion over the spiritual; the spiritual man is here signified by the sons of Israel.

(But this may be seen explained in detail in the Arcana Coelestia, n. 7516–7532.) [9] So, too, these words in Moses have a like signification: Jehovah shall smite thee with the boil of Egypt and with emerods, and with scab and the itch, so that thou canst not be healed, with which thou shalt become mad from the sight of their eyes. Jehovah shall smite thee with an evil boil upon the knees and upon the thighs, of which thou canst hot be healed (Deut. 28:27, 34–36). The plagues here mentioned signify evils and falsities of various kinds arising from the filthy loves of the natural man, for they correspond thereto. For sores and wounds exist from injury to flesh and blood, and evils and falsities from injury to the Divine good and the Divine truth; and flesh corresponds to good, and thus signifies it in the Word, and blood to truth, and thus signifies it. [10] As “leprosy” signifies the profanation of truth, and the profanation of truth is various, is light or grievous, interior or exterior, and is according to the quality of the truth profaned, so too its effects are various, and these are signified by the appearances in leprosy, which were: Tumors, suppurating tumors, white pustules, reddenings, abscesses, burnings, tetter, scall (Lev. 13:1 to the end). The Jewish nation was af flicted with such things from correspondence because of their profanations of the Word, not only in their flesh, but also in their garments, houses, and vessels.

For there is profanation that is interior and not exterior, and there is profanation that is interior and at the same time exterior, and there can be also a kind of profanation that is exterior and not at the same time interior. Interior profanation is produced by the life, exterior by the speech. Interior profanation, which is produced by the life, becomes exterior also, or of the speech, after death. For then everyone thinks and wills, and so far as it can be permitted, speaks and acts, according to his life; thus not as he did in the world. In the world, for the world’s sake and to gain reputation, man is wont to speak and act otherwise than as he thinks and wills from his life. This is why it has been said that there is profanation that is interior and not at the same time exterior. There can also be a kind of profanation that is exterior and not at the same time interior. It can come from the style of the Word, which is not at all the style of the world, and for this reason it may be to some extent despised from ignorance of its interior sanctity. 963. Upon the men that had the mark of the beast and that adored his image, signifies those who acknowledge faith alone and its doctrine, and who live according to it. This is evident from the signification of “the beast,” as being those who are in faith alone, or in faith separated from goods of life, and who confirm this by reasonings from the natural man (see in the preceding thirteenth chapter, from beginning to end). It is evident also from the signification of its “mark,” as being acknowl edgment, reception, and attestation thereof (see above, n. 838, 886). Also from the signification of its “image,” as being doctrine, and of “adoring” it, as being to acknowledge it in heart and life (see n. 827, 833). That to such belong evil works and falsifications of the Word has been shown in the chapters that treat of the dragon and of the two beasts of the dragon, and is clearly evident from this, that such exclude good works from saving or justifying faith, teaching that faith justifies and saves without these, and as they are unnecessary they are omitted. It is from an eternal statute or from the Divine order that where there are not good works there are evil works; therefore these evil works are what are signified by “the great9 and noxious"

For no one has religion except from revelation, and with us revelation is the Word. Abstinence from profaning the holiness of the Word must be from the heart, and not merely from the mouth. Those who abstain from the heart live from religion; but those who abstain merely from the mouth do not live from religion, for they abstain either for the sake of self or for the sake of the world, in that the Word can be made to serve them as a means of acquiring honor and gain; or they abstain from some fear. But of these many are hypocrites who have no religion. 964. Verse 3.

Verse 3. And the second angel poured out his vial into the sea, signifies the state of the church manifested as to the knowledges of truth in the natural man.

(Continuation: The Third Commandment) [2] Now follows the third commandment, which is, to keep the sabbath holy. The third and fourth commandments of the Decalog contain things that must be done, namely, that the sabbath must be kept holy, and that parents must be honored. The other commandments contain things that are not to be done, namely, that other gods must not be worshiped; that the name of God must not be profaned; that one must not steal, must not commit adultery, must not bear false witness, must not covet the goods of others. These two commandments are commandments to be done, because the sanctification of the rest of the commandments depends upon these, for the “sabbath” signifies the union in the Lord of the Divine Itself and the Divine Human, also His conjunction with heaven and the church, and thus the marriage of good and truth with the man who is being regenerated. This being the signification of the sabbath, it was the chief representative of all things of worship in the Israelitish Church, as is evident in Jeremiah (17:20–27), and elsewhere. It was the chief representative of all things of worship, because the first thing in all things of worship is the acknowledgment of the Divine in the Lord’s Human, for without that acknowledgment man can believe and do only from self, and to believe from self is to believe falsities, and to do from self is to do evils, as is also evident from the Lord’s words in John: To those asking, What shall we do that we might work the works of God? Jesus said, This is the work of God, that ye believe in Him whom God hath sent (6:28, 29). And in the same:"

[3] That the sabbath represented that union and the holy acknowledgment of it, has been shown in many places in the Arcana Coelestia, namely, that the “sabbath” signified in the highest sense the union of the Divine Itself and the Divine Human in the Lord, in the internal sense the conjunction of the Lord’s Human with heaven and with the church, in general the conjunction of good and truth, thus the heavenly marriage (n. 8495, 10356, 10730). Therefore the rest on the sabbath day signified the state of that union, because the Lord then has rest; also through that union there is peace and salvation in the heavens and on the earth. In a relative sense it signified the conjunction of man with the Lord, because man then has peace and salvation (n. 8494, 8510, 10360, 10367, 10370, 10374, 10668, 10730). The six days preceding the sabbath signified the labors and combats that precede union and conjunction (n. 8510, 8888, 9431, 10360, 10667). [4] The man who is being regenerated is in two states, the first when he is in truths and by means of truths is being led to good and into good, the other when he is in good. When man is in the first state he is in combats or temptations; but when he is in the second state he is in the tranquility of peace. The former state is signified by the six days of labor that precede the sabbath; and the latter state is signified by the rest on the sabbath day (n. 9274, 9431, 10360). The Lord also was in two states; the first when He was Divine truth and from it fought against the hells and subjugated them, the other when He was made Divine good by union with the very Divine in Himself. The former state was signified in the highest sense by the six days of labor, and the latter by the sabbath (n. 10360). Because such things were represented by the sabbath it was the chief representative of worship, and the holiest of all (n. 10357, 10372). “To do work on the sabbath day” signified to be led not by the Lord but by self, thus to be disjoined (n. 7893, 8495, 10360, 10362, 10365). The sabbath day is not now representative, but is a day of instruction (n. 10360 at the end)."

Knowledges of truth from the Word are the truths of the sense of its letter, that is, the truths in the Word that are for the natural man, and these, too, are Divine truths. These wholly falsified are signified by the words, “the sea became blood as of one dead.” The Divine truths of the sense of the letter of the Word are said to be falsified when they are perverted even to the destruction of interior Divine truth, that is, Divine truth in the heavens. In the heavens they then appear with man as the blood of one dead. It has been frequently shown above that those who separate faith from the goods of life falsify the Word; and it is of such that these things are said, as is evident from the second verse of this chapter. (Continuation: The Fourth Commandment) [2] The fourth commandment of the Decalog is that parents must be honored. This commandment was given because honor to parents represented and thus signified love to the Lord and love towards the church, for “father” in the heavenly sense, that is, the Heavenly Father, is the Lord; and “mother” in the heavenly sense, that is, the heavenly mother, is the church; “honor” signifies the good of love; and “length of days,” which they will have, signifies the happiness of eternal life. So is this commandment understood in heaven, where no other father but the Lord is known, and no other mother but the kingdom of the Lord, which is also the church. For the Lord gives life from Himself, and through the church He gives nourishment. That in the heavenly sense no father in the world can be meant, and indeed, when man is in a heavenly idea, can be mentioned, the Lord teaches in Matthew: Call no man your father on earth; for one is your Father who is in the heavens (23:9)."

That “length of days” signifies the happiness of eternal life (n. 8898); and that “honor” signifies the good of love (n. 8897, and above, n. 288, 345).

And every living soul in the sea died, signifies that there was no longer anything from the Word from the spiritual man in the natural man. This is evident from the signification of “living soul in the sea,” as being what has in itself spiritual life (of which presently); also from the signification of “sea,” as being the generals of truth in the natural man, and thus also the knowledges of truth from the Word (of which just above, n. 965). When these have no life from the spiritual world or from heaven they are called dead. “Living soul in the sea” means fishes of various kinds, and these signify knowledges (scientifica) of the natural man (see above, n. 531); they also signify the knowledges of truth from the Word with natural men, for with natural men the knowledges (cognitiones) of truth from the Word do not differ from the knowledges (scientifica) of the world, and for the reason that with such these knowledges have in them no life from the spiritual, and unless the spiritual flows in out of heaven into the knowledges from the Word they are not living but dead. [2] Knowledges of truth from the Word are not living with man until the internal spiritual man has been opened; and this is opened by the Lord while man is being regenerated; and then through the opened spiritual man the spiritual out of heaven flows into the knowledges of truth and good that are from the Word in the natural man and vivifies them. It vivifies them in such a way that the knowledges of truth and good in the natural man become correspondences of the spiritual things that are in the internal spiritual man; and when they are correspondences they are living, for then the spiritual is enclosed in the particular knowledges or"

For this reason man after death comes into these spiritual things, and the knowledges to which they corresponded serve them for a basis. But it is otherwise with those in whom the knowledges from the Word have not been vivified. The spiritual that flows into the knowledges out of heaven is the affection of truth, the affection of good, and the affection of bearing fruit; for it is spiritual heat which is the love or the affection of good, and spiritual light which is the affection of truth. These are the spiritual things that flow in and vivify the knowledges of truth from the Word with those who are in the life of charity and in faith therefrom. But these same knowledges with those who are in faith separated from a life of charity are dead. This, therefore, is what is signified by the words “every living soul in the sea died.” (Continuation: The Fifth Commandment)10 [3] The fifth commandment is, “Thou shalt not steal.” By “thefts” are meant thefts that are manifest and those not manifest, such as unlawful usury and gains, which are effected by fraud and craft under various pretenses to make them appear lawful, or so done clandestinely as not to appear at all. Such gains are commonly made by higher and lower managers of the goods of others, by merchants, also by judges who sell judgments and thus make justice purchasable. These and many other things are thefts that must be abstained from and shunned, and finally renounced as sins against God, because they are against the Divine laws that are in the Word and against this law, which is one among the fundamental laws of all religions in the whole globe. For these ten commandments are universals, given to the end that in living from these a man may live from religion, since by a life from religion man is conjoined with heaven, while a life according to these from obedience to civil and moral law conjoins man with the world and not with heaven, and to be conjoined with the world and not with heaven is to be conjoined with hell. 968.

(Continuation respecting the Fifth Commandment) [2] Man is so created as to be an image of heaven and an image of the world, for he is a microcosm. He is born of his parents an image of the world, and he is born again to be an image of heaven. To be born again is to be regenerated; and man is regenerated by the Lord by means of truths from the Word and a life according to them. Man is an image of the world as to his natural mind, and he is an image of heaven as to his spiritual mind. The natural mind, which is the world, is beneath; and the spiritual mind, which is heaven, is above. The natural mind is full of all kinds of evils, such as thefts, adulteries, murders, false witnesses, covetousnesses, and even blasphemies and profanations of God. These evils and many others have their seat in that mind, for the loves of them are there, and thus the delights of thinking, willing, and doing them. These things are innate in that mind from parents, for man is born and grows up into the things that are in that mind, and is restrained only by the bonds of civil law and by the bonds of moral life from doing them, and from thus manifesting the tendencies of his depraved will. Who cannot see that the Lord cannot flow in out of heaven with man and teach him and lead him before these evils have been removed? For they obstruct, repel, pervert, and suffocate the truths and goods of heaven, which present themselves from above, press down and strive to flow in. For evils are infernal and goods are heavenly, and everything infernal burns with hatred against everything heavenly. [3] This makes clear that before the Lord can flow in with heaven out of heaven and form man to the image of heaven, those evils that lie heaped up in the natural mind must needs be removed. Moreover, as the removal of evils must come first before man can be taught and led by the Lord, the reason is evident why in eight commandments of the Decalog the evil works that must not be done are recounted, but not the goods that must be done. Good does not exist together with evil, nor does it exist before evils have been removed; for until then there is no way possible from heaven"

Man is like a dark sea, the waters of which must be removed on either side before the Lord in a cloud and in fire can give a passage to the sons of Israel. The “dark sea” signifies hell, “Pharaoh with the Egyptians” the natural man, and “the sons of Israel” the spiritual man. 970. And they became blood, signifies that it was destroyed by falsifications. This is evident from the signification of “blood,” as being truth falsified (see above, n. 966); therefore that “the rivers and fountains became blood” signifies that the faculty of understanding the truths of the Word was destroyed by falsifications. Every man has the faculty of understanding truths, for it is this faculty by which man is distinguished from beasts; and this remains with every man, even with the evil, since it is the spiritual part of man and the most essential means of his regeneration. For man is regenerated by the Lord by means of truths, and if he were not able to understand truths he could not receive them and thus be reformed; for to receive what he is not able to understand does not profit. That this is so has been proved by experience in the spiritual world. There was a discussion among the spirits whether everyone has the faculty of understanding truths; and an infernal spirit was taken as a witness whether he could understand the truths of heaven, and it was found that he understood them when he heard them just as well as a good spirit, and yet that he was not willing to understand them, for he turned away from them because they were opposed to the evils and the falsities therefrom that were delightful to him. And it was said that man through that faculty has conjunction with the Lord, since that faculty is proper to man. That faculty is said to have been destroyed by falsifications, because those who have falsified the Word are not willing to understand truths themselves; and those who are not willing are as it were not able, although they would be able if they were willing. For the mind of such rejects truths, and like one deaf does not hear them so long as it clings to things opposite. But when these opposite things are removed it is as if the ears of the deaf were opened. All this has been said to make known what is meant by the destruction of the faculty of understanding the truths of the Word by falsifications."

For so long as a man is in the dim light of the natural man only he is like one shut up in a chamber where he sees by a candle. But as soon as the natural man has been purified from evils and falsities therefrom he is as if he saw through windows in the wall the things of heaven from the light of heaven. For as soon as evils have been removed, the higher mind, which is called the spiritual mind, is opened, and this, viewed in itself, is a type or image of heaven. Through this mind the Lord flows in and enables man to see from the light of heaven, and through this He also reforms and at length regenerates the natural man, and implants in it truths in the place of falsities and goods in the place of evils. This the Lord does through spiritual love, which is the love of truth and good. Man is then placed in the midst between two loves, between the love of evil and the love of good; and when the love of evil recedes the love of good takes its place. It is solely through the life according to the commandments of the Decalog, that is, through refraining from the evils there enumerated because they are sins, and finally shunning them as infernal, that the love of evil recedes. [3] In a word, so long as man does not refrain from evils because they are sins the spiritual mind is shut; but as soon as he refrains from evils because they are sins the spiritual mind is opened, and with that mind heaven also. And when heaven is opened man comes into another light as to all things of the church, heaven, and eternal life; although so long as man lives in this world the difference between this and the former light is scarcely noticeable, and for the reason that in the world man thinks naturally even about spiritual things, and until he passes from the natural into the spiritual world spiritual things are enclosed in natural ideas; but in the spiritual world spiritual things are disclosed, perceived, and made evident."

This is evident from the signification of “the angel of the waters,” as being the Lord’s spiritual kingdom; for “angel” signifies in the Word something pertaining to the Lord, also a heavenly society, also heaven; here “the angel of the waters” signifies the heavens of which the Lord’s spiritual kingdom consists, for “waters” signify truths, thus things spiritual, since the Divine truth in the heavens is called spiritual, while the Divine good is called celestial. All the heavens are divided into two kingdoms, one called the spiritual kingdom, the other the celestial kingdom. The spiritual kingdom consists of the heavens and the angels there that are in the Divine truth, and those heavens are in the southern and northern quarters. The celestial kingdom consists of the heavens and the angels there that are in the Divine good, and these heavens are in the eastern and western quarters. Therefore the spiritual kingdom, which consists of the heavens and the angels there, that are in the Divine truth, is meant by “the angel of the waters\"; while the celestial kingdom, which consists of the heavens and the angels there that are in the Divine good, is meant by “the angel from the altar” (described in the seventh verse of this chapter), since the “altar” signifies the Divine good. That “the angel of the waters” preached the Lord’s justice is evident from the things said by that angel that now follow. (Continuation respecting the Fifth Commandment) [2] So far as man refrains from evils and shuns and turns away from them as sins, good flows in from the Lord. The good that flows in is the affection of knowing and understanding truths, and the affection of willing and doing goods. But man cannot refrain from evils by shunning and turning away from them of himself, for he himself is in evils from his birth, and thus from nature; and evils cannot of themselves shun evils, for this would be a like a man’s shunning his own nature, which is impossible; consequently it must be the Lord, who is the Divine good and the Divine truth, who causes man to shun them. Nevertheless, man ought to shun evils as if of himself, for what a man does as if of himself becomes his and is appropriated to him as his own; while what he does not"

What comes from the Lord to man must be received by man; and it cannot be received unless he is conscious of it, that is, as if of himself. This reciprocation is a necessity to reformation. This is why the ten commandments were given, and why it is commanded in them that man shall not worship other gods, shall not profane the name of God, shall not steal, shall not commit adultery, shall not kill, shall not covet the house, wife, or servants of others, thus that man shall refrain from doing these things by thinking, when the love of evil allures and incites, that they must not be done because they are sins against God, and in themselves are infernal. So far, therefore, as a man shuns these evils so far the love of truth and good enters from the Lord; and this love causes man to shun these evils, and at length to turn away from them as sins. And as the love of truth and good puts these evils to flight, it follows that man shuns them not from himself but from the Lord, since the love of truth and good is from the Lord. If a man shuns evils merely from a fear of hell they are withdrawn; but goods do not take their place; for as soon as the fear departs the evils return. [3] To man alone is it granted to think as if of himself about good and evil, that is, that good must be loved and done because it is Divine and remains to eternity, and that evil must be hated and not done because it is devilish and remains to eternity. To think thus is not granted to any beast. A beast can do good and shun evil, yet not of itself, but either from instinct or habit or fear, and never from the thought that such a thing is a good or an evil, thus not of itself. Consequently one who would have it believed that man shuns evils or does goods not as if of himself but from an imperceptible influx, or from the imputation of the Lord’s merit, would also have it believed that man lives like a beast without thought of, or perception of, or the affection of truth and good. That this is so has been made clear to me from manifold experience in the spiritual world. Every man after death is there prepared either for heaven or for hell. From the man who is prepared for heaven evils are removed, and from the man who is prepared for hell goods are removed; and all such removals are effected as if by them. Likewise those who do evils are driven by punishments to reject them as if of themselves; but if they do not reject them as if"

By this it was made clear that those who hang down their hands, waiting for influx, or for the imputation of the Lord’s merit, continue in the state of their evil, and hang down their hands forever. [4] To shun evils as sins is to shun the infernal societies that are in them, and man cannot shun these unless he repels them and turns away from them; and a man cannot turn away from them with repulsion unless he loves good and from that love does not will evil. For a man must either will evil or will good; and so far as he wills good he does not will evil; and it is granted him to will good when he makes the commandments of the Decalog to be of his religion, and lives according to them. [5] Since man must refrain from evils as sins as if of himself, these ten commandments were inscribed by the Lord on two tables, and these were called a covenant; and this covenant was entered into in the same way as it is usual to enter into covenants between two, that is, one proposes and the other accepts, and the one who accepts consents. If he does not consent the covenant is not established. To consent to this covenant is to think, will, and do as if of oneself. Man’s thinking to shun evil and to do good as if of himself is done not by man, but by the Lord. This is done by the Lord for the sake of reciprocation and consequent conjunction; for the Lord’s Divine love is such that it wills that what is its own shall be man’s, and as these things cannot be man’s, because they are Divine, it makes them to be as if they were man’s. In this way reciprocal conjunction is effected, that is, that man is in the Lord and the Lord in man, according to the words of the Lord Himself in John (14:20); for this would not be possible if there were not in the conjunction something belonging as it were to man. What man does as if of himself he does as if of his will, of his affection, of his freedom, consequently of his life. Unless these were present on man’s part, as if they were his there could be no receptivity, because nothing reactive, thus no covenant and no conjunction; in fact, no ground whatever for the imputation that man had done evil or good or had believed truth or falsity, thus that there is from merit a hell for anyone because of evil works, or from grace a heaven for anyone because of good works."

And in a relative sense to exist is to be in all things of heaven and the church; and this is effected by the Divine truth. This to be is what is meant by the eternal; for in heaven (otherwise than in the world) eternal, as applied to the Lord is without any idea of time; for in the angelic idea eternal means a state of the Divine existence, which nevertheless makes one with the Divine essence, which is Jehovah. The infinite in relation to being is signified by “who art” in Jehovah; and the infinite in relation to existence is signified by “who was” in Jehovah. The infinite existence which is also the eternal, is the Divine proceeding, from which is heaven and everything of it. The Divine existence is also the Divine being but it is called existence in relation to heaven, where it is the all in all.

For example, there are higher and lower managers of property, merchants, judges, officers of every kind, and workmen, who refrain from thefts, that is, from unlawful modes of gain and usury, and who shun these, but only to secure reputation and thus honor or gain, because of civil and moral laws, in a word, from some natural love or natural fear, thus from mere ly external constraints, and not from religion; but the interiors of such are full of thefts and robberies, and these burst forth when external constraints are"

This is evident from the signification of “holy,” as being the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord; for this in the Word is meant by “holy,” also by “the Holy Spirit,” which is therefore called “the Spirit of Truth.” (That in the Word “holy” is predicated of truth, and “just” of good, may be seen n. 204; and that the Lord alone is holy, because He is the Divine truth itself, n. 204a, 285, 328 f.) (Continuation respecting the Fifth Commandment) [2] So far then as the various kinds and species of thefts are removed, and the more they are removed, so far the kinds and species of good to which they by opposition correspond enter and occupy their place; and these have reference in general to what is sincere, right and just. For when a man shuns and turns away from unlawful gains through fraud and craft he so far wills what is sincere, right, and just, and at length begins to love what is sincere because it is sincere, what is right because it is right, and what is just because it is just. He begins to love these things because they are from the Lord, and the love of the Lord is in them. For to love the Lord is not to love the Person, but to love the things that proceed from the Lord, for these are the Lord with man; thus it is to love sincerity itself, right itself, and justice itself. And as these are the Lord, so far as a man loves these, and thus acts from them, so far he acts from the Lord and so far the Lord removes insincerity and injustice as to the very intentions and volitions in which they have their roots, and always with less resistance and struggle, and therefore with less effort than in the first attempts. Thus it is that man thinks from conscience and acts from integrity, not indeed the man of him self but as if of himself; for he then acknowledges from faith and also from perception. It indeed appears as if he thought and did these things from himself, and yet he does them not from himself but from the Lord."

This is evident from the signification of “judging these things,” as being to cause them to be done or come to pass, namely, what follows, that “because they have poured out the blood of saints and prophets, He gave them blood to drink.” But as this is said respecting the Lord, and the Lord never gives anyone blood to drink, or gives what is signified by “drinking blood,” and yet these with many other like things in the Word are attributed in the sense of the letter to the Lord, it follows that these words must be understood to mean that the Lord foresaw that these things would take place, and provided that no harm should be done thereby to the heavens, which are in the Divine good and in the Divine truth. For the Lord foresees evil and provides good. Such are the things signified by these words in the spiritual sense, that is, when the natural, which is the exterior, is put off, and the spiritual, which is the interior, appears; consequently when the thought of the natural man, which is according to appearances, is supplanted by the spiritual thought of the angels, which is according to the essence of the thing. This makes clear what the sense of the letter of the Word is and what its spiritual sense is, also what human thought is and what angelic thought is, namely, that these are in accord like what is internal and what is external, or like a cause and an effect, and that the effect or external that is with man is put off, and the cause or internal that is with the angels who are with man becomes manifest.

The difference between works done from man and works done from the Lord in man is not apparent to men’s sight, but is clearly evident to the sight of angels. Works done from man are like sepulchers outwardly whitened, which within are full of the bones of the dead. They are like platters and cups outwardly clean, but containing unclean things of every kind. They are like fruits inwardly rotten, but with the outer skin still shining; or like nuts or almonds eaten by worms within, while the shell remains untouched; or like a foul harlot with a fair face. Such are the good works done from man himself, since however good they appear on the outside, within they are full of impurities of every kind; for their interiors are infernal, while their exteriors appear heavenly. But after man shuns and turns away from evils as sins his works are good not only outwardly but inwardly also; and the more interior they are the more they are good, for the more interior they are the nearer they are to the Lord.

(Continuation respecting the Fifth Commandment) [2] It has been said that so far as a man shuns and turns away from evils as sins he does goods, and that the goods that he does are the good works which are meant in the Word, for the reason that they are done in the Lord; also that these works are good so far as man turns away from the evils opposed to them, because so far they are done from the Lord and not from man. Nevertheless, works are more or less good according to the excellence of the use; for works must be uses. The best are those that are done for the sake of the uses of the church. Next in point of goodness come those that are done as uses of one’s country; and so on, the uses determining the goodness of the works. The goodness of works increases with man according to the fullness of truths from affection for which they are done; since the man who turns away from evils as sins wishes to know truths because truths teach uses and the quality of their good. This is why good loves truth and truth loves good, and they wish to be conjoined. So far, therefore, as such a man learns truths from the affection of them so far he does goods more wisely and more fully, more wisely because he knows how to distinguish uses and to do them with judgment and justice, and more fully because all truths are present in the performance of uses, and form the spiritual sphere that the affection of them produces. 976.

This is evident from the signification of “drinking blood,” as being to imbibe falsities, for “blood” signifies truth falsified, and “to drink” signifies to imbibe.

It is similar if they judge according to friendships and favors, for friendships and favors are also profits and gains. When these are the end and judgments are the means, all things that they do are evil, and are what are meant in the Word by “evil works” and “not doing judgment and justice, perverting the right of the poor; of the needy, of the fatherless, of the widow, and of the innocent.” Yea, even if they do justice, and yet regard profit as the end they indeed do a good work, but to them it is not good; for justice, which is Divine, is to them a means, and such gain is the end; and that which is made the end is everything, while that which is made the means is nothing except so far as it is serviceable to the end. Consequently after death such judges continue to love what is unjust as well as what is just, and are condemned to hell as thieves. I speak this from what I have seen. These are such as do not abstain from evils because they are sins, but only because they fear the punishments of the civil law and the loss of reputation, honor, and office, and thus of gain. [3] It is otherwise with judges who abstain from evils as sins and shun them because they are contrary to the Divine laws, and thus contrary to God. These have justice for their end, and they venerate, cherish, and love it as Divine. In justice they see God, as it were, because everything just, like everything good and true, is from God.

[3] That this is so becomes evident after death, when man acts from his interior will and love, and not from the exterior; for then he thinks about and devises nothing but sharp practices and robberies, and withdraws himself from those who are sincere, and betakes himself either to forests or deserts, where he devotes himself to stratagems. In a word, all such become robbers. But it is otherwise with merchants who shun as sins thefts of every kind, especially the more interior and hidden, which are effected by craft and deceit. All their works are good, because they are from the Lord; for the influx from heaven, that is, through heaven from the Lord, for accomplishing such works is not intercepted by the evils just mentioned. To these, riches do no harm, because to them riches are means for uses. Their tradings are the uses by which they serve their country and their fellow citizens; and through their riches they are in a condition to perform those uses to which the affection of good leads them. 979.

Also from the signification of “Almighty,” as being to be, to live, and to have power from Himself (see n. 43, 689, 939); so also that He is being, life, and power to all things; for the Lord is all this from Himself, but man is all this from the Lord. Also from the signification of “Thy judgments,” as being those things that are being done, namely, those mentioned above in the sixth verse.

(That “just” is predicated of the Divine good may be seen above, n. 972.) The same things are involved in these words, “Yea, O Lord God Almighty, true and just are Thy judgments,” as in the words of the fifth verse, “Thou art just, O Lord, who art and who wast, and art holy, because Thou hast judged these things.” The only difference is that the latter were said from the Lord’s spiritual kingdom, and the former from His celestial kingdom. “Yea” is here an expression confirmative of the statements from the spiritual kingdom. That the same things are involved see above (n. 972–974), and compare. (Continuation respecting the Fifth Commandment) [2] From what has been said above, what is meant in the Word by good works can now be seen, namely, that they are all works done by man when evils have been removed as sins. For the works done after this are done from man only as if from him; for they are done from the Lord, and all works done from the Lord are good, and are called the goods of life, the goods of charity, and good works; as for instance, all the judgments of a judge who has justice as his end, and who venerates and loves it as Divine, and who detests as infamous decisions made for the sake of rewards or friendship, or from favor. Thus he consults the good of his country by causing justice and judgment to reign therein as in heaven; and thus he consults the peace of every innocent citizen and protects him from the violence of evildoers. All these are good works. So all services of managers and dealings of merchants are good works when they shun unlawful gains as sins against the Divine laws. When a man shuns evils as sins he daily learns what a good work is, and the affection of doing good grows with him, and the affection of knowing truths for the sake of good; for so far as he knows truths he can perform works more fully and more wisely, and thus his works become more truly good. Cease, therefore, from asking in thyself, “What are the good works that I must do, or what good must I do to receive eternal life?” Only cease from evils as sins and look to the Lord, and the Lord will teach and lead you."

The “sun” signifies love to God, thus to the Lord, because the Lord appears before the angels in the heavens as a sun, and His appearance as a sun is from the Divine love. For all love in the spiritual world corresponds to fire and flame, and because it corresponds it is manifested representatively by fire and by flame; consequently the Lord’s Divine love appears as a sun. This is why the “sun” signifies in the Word the Lord as to love towards all who are in heaven and in the world, and in a reciprocal sense love to the Lord. Love to the Lord means the love or affection of doing His commandments, thus the love of keeping the commandments of the Decalog. For so far as a man from love or from affection keeps and does these, so far he loves the Lord, and for the reason that these are the Lord with man."

Who at this day can believe that the love of adultery is the fundamental love of all infernal and diabolical loves, and that the chaste love of marriage is the fundamental love of all heavenly and Divine loves; consequently so far as a man is in the love of adultery so far he is in every evil love, if not in act yet in endeavor; and on the other hand, so far as man is in the chaste love of marriage so far he is in every good love, if not in act yet in endeavor? Who at this day can believe that he who is in the love of adultery believes nothing of the Word, thus nothing of the church, and even in his heart denies God; and on the other hand, that he who is in the chaste love of marriage is in charity and in faith, and in love to God; also that the chastity of marriage makes one with religion, and the lasciviousness of adultery makes one with naturalism? [3] All this at this day is unknown because the church is at its end, and is devastated as to truth and as to good; and when the church is such, the man of the church, by influx from hell, comes into the persuasion that adulteries are not detestable things and abominations, and thus comes into the belief that marriages and adulteries do not differ in their essence, but only as a matter of order, and yet the difference between them is like the difference between heaven and hell. That such is the difference between them will be seen in what follows. This, then, is why in the Word in its spiritual sense heaven and the church are meant by nuptials and marriages, and hell and the rejection of all things of the church are meant in the Word in its spiritual sense by adulteries and whoredoms."

This is evident from the signification of “heat,” as being the lust of falsity and for falsity (see n. 481); also from the signification of “fire,” as being love in both senses, namely, love to the Lord and love towards the neighbor, and in the contrary sense love of self and love of the world, and thus a cupidity for evils of every kind. That the loves of self and of the world are the origins of all evils may be seen above (n. 162, 171, 506, 510, 512, 517, 650a, 653a, 950, 951). And as these loves are the origins of all evils, and in their continuation are called cupidities and also lusts, so “to scorch men with fire” signifies the cupidity or lust for falsities from evils of every kind, and thus for evil or for doing harm to others; for this is the delight of life of those who are in the love of self and in the love of the world. It is from this delight that the continuation of these loves are called cupidities and lusts. [2] In the world it is scarcely known that all who are in the love of self, according to the delight of that love, are in the delight of injuring others who do not make one with them. That this is so is clearly evident from the same persons after death; then it is the delight of their life to do harm and to do evil to others in any way whatever, especially to the good. This delight of theirs is the delight of hatred; for they hate, and from hatred persecute, all who worship the Lord. This hatred is not manifested with them in the world because they are held back and checked by external restraints, which are fears of punishments from the civil law, and of loss of reputation, honor, gain, employments, pleasures, and of life, and injuries to it, so that this hatred does not come forth to the sight of others; nevertheless it lies hidden in their spirit; and consequently after death, when man becomes a spirit and external restraints are taken away from him it breaks forth even into destruction so far as the reins are loosened. Such is the signification of “scorching men with fire.” [3] It is said that “the angel poured out his vial into the sun,” and that “it was given him to scorch men with fire,” and that the “sun” signifies love to God, and “heat” and “fire” signify the cupidity for"

For so far as heavenly loves and affections flow into the evil there is kindled in them a frenzy and cupidity for doing evil and speaking falsity; and for the reason that every good of heaven with them is turned into evil, and every truth of heaven into falsity. For their interiors, which belong to the will and consequent thought, are turned directly contrary to heavenly things, and whatever flows into a contrary form is turned into what is contrary. And when that which flows in becomes powerful it is turned into fury, and when very powerful into torment; as when good flows strongly into the evil, the evil come either into a state of fury or of infernal torment. But when evil flows powerfully into the good, the good come into a state of anguish, and also into a certain torment of conscience. [4] The inmost cause of these effects is that the life of the affections and consequent thoughts of all in the entire world, both the spiritual and the natural worlds, proceed from a single fountain of life, which is the Lord, and this life is received by each one according to the quality of his life, thus according to the quality of his love; therefore those who have turned heavenly love with themselves into infernal love cannot help turning into their own love the love that flows in out of heaven; the same as the heat and light of the sun always do when they flow into objects on the earth, some of these from that influx giving forth a sweet odor, and some a foul odor, and yet the heat and light are the same in themselves and are from a single fountain, namely, the sun. (Continuation respecting the Sixth Commandment) [5] Since adultery is hell with man and marriage is heaven with him, it follows that so far as a man loves adultery he removes himself from heaven; consequently adulteries close heaven and open hell, and this they do so far as they are believed to be allowable and are perceived to be more delightful than marriages.

And since adultery is hell it follows that unless a man abstains from adulteries and shuns them and turns away from them as infernal he shuts up heaven to himself, and does not receive the least influx therefrom. Afterwards he reasons that marriages and adulteries are alike, but that marriages must be maintained in kingdoms for the sake of order and on account of the education of offspring; also that adulteries are not criminal, since offspring are equally born from them; and they are not harmful to women, since they can endure them, and by them the procreation of the human race is promoted. He does not know that these and other like reasonings in favor of adulteries ascend from the Stygian waters of hell, and that the lustful and bestial nature of man which inheres in him from birth attracts them and sucks them in with delight, as a swine does excrement. That such reasonings, which at this day possess the minds of most men in the Christian world, are Stygian, will be seen in what follows. 983. Verse 9. And men were scorched with great heat, signifies the cupidity of adulterating the truths and goods of the Word. This is evident from the signification of “great heat,” as being the lust of falsity, and for falsity, thus the cupidity of adulterating the truths and goods of the Word (see n. 481). This is said of those who are in faith separated from the goods of life, who are meant by those that “have the mark of the beast” and that “adore his image” (verse 2). Because such separate from faith the very essential of the church, which is the good of life, and thus remove it from being a means of salvation, they cannot do otherwise than falsify all the truths of the Word; for those who set aside a life according to the Lord’s commandments annihilate all things of the Word, since all things of the Word are precepts of life. The precepts of faith, which are the truths of the Word, teach life."

The origin of love truly conjugial is the Lord’s love for the church and this is why the Lord is called in the Word the “Bridegroom” and the “Husband,” and the church the “bride” and the “wife.” It is from this marriage that the church is the church in general and in particular. The church in particular is a man in whom the church is. From this it is clear that the Lord’s conjunction with a man of the church is the very origin of love truly conjugial; and how that conjunction can be the origin shall be told. The Lord’s conjunction with a man of the church is a conjunction of good and truth; good is from the Lord, and truth is with man, and from this is the conjunction that is called the heavenly marriage. From that marriage, love truly conjugial exists between two partners that are in such conjunction with the Lord. From this it is now evident that love truly conjugial is from the Lord alone, and exists with those who are in the conjunction of good and truth from the Lord. As this conjunction is reciprocal it is said by the Lord that: They are in Him, and He in them (John 14:20). [3] This conjunction or this marriage was thus established from creation. The man was created to be the understanding of truth, and the woman to be the affection of good; and thus the man to be truth, and the woman good. When the understanding of truth which is with the man makes one with the affection of good which is with the woman, there is a conjunction of the two minds into one. This conjunction is the spiritual marriage from which conjugial love descends. For when two minds are so conjoined as to be one mind there is love between them; and when this love, which is the love of spiritual marriage, descends into the body it becomes the love of natural marriage. That this is so anyone can clearly perceive if he will. A married pair who interiorly or as to their minds love each other mutually and reciprocally also love each other mutually and reciprocally as to their bodies. It is known that all love descends into the body from an affection of the mind, and that apart from such an origin no love exists."

Heaven is a marriage because all who are in the heavens are in the marriage of good and truth; and hell is adultery because all who are in the hells are in the marriage of evil and falsity. From this it follows that marriage and adultery are as opposite as heaven and hell are. 984. And they blasphemed the name of God, signifies the falsification of the Lord’s Word even to the destruction of the Divine truth in the heavens. This is evident from the signification of “blaspheming,” as being to falsify the Divine truth even to its destruction in heaven (see n. 778); also from the signification of “the name of God,” as being the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord, thus the Word (see n. 962); therefore the words “they blasphemed the name of God” signify the falsification of the Word even to the destruction of the Divine truth in the heavens. (On the falsification of the Word even to the destruction in heaven of the Divine truth that the Word contains see above, n. 778, 888, 914, 916 at the end, 950.) (Continuation respecting the Sixth Commandment) [2] Man was so created as to be spiritual and celestial love, and thus an image and likeness of God.

All the angels in the third heaven are likenesses of God; and all the angels in the second heaven are images of God. Man can become the love which is an image or likeness of God only by a marriage of good and truth; for good and truth inmostly love one another, and ardently long to be united that they may be one; and for the reason that the Divine good and the Divine truth proceed from the Lord united, therefore they must be united in an angel of heaven and in a man of the church. This union is by no means possible except by the marriage of two minds into one, since, as has been said before, man was created to be the understanding of truth, and thus truth, and woman was created to be the affection of good, and thus good; therefore in them the"

For conjugial love which descends from that conjunction is the veriest means by which man (homo) becomes the love that is the image or the likeness of God. For the two partners who are in conjugial love from the Lord love one another mutually and reciprocally from the heart, thus from inmosts; and therefore although apparently two they are actually one, two as to their bodies, but one as to life. This may be compared to the eyes, which are two as organs but one as to the sight; also to the ears, which are two as organs but one as to hearing; so, too, the arms and the feet are two as members but one as to use, the arms one as to action, and the feet one as to walking. So with the other pairs with man. All these have reference to good and truth, the organ or member on the right to good, and that on the left to truth. It is the same with a husband and wife between whom there is love truly conjugial; they are two as to their bodies but one as to life; consequently in heaven two partners are not called two angels but one. All this makes clear that through marriage man becomes a form of love, and thus a form of heaven, which is the image and likeness of God. [3] Man is born into the love of evil and falsity, which love is the love of adultery; and this love cannot be converted and changed into spiritual love, which is the image of God, and still less into celestial love, which is the likeness of God, except by the marriage of good and truth from the Lord, and not fully except by the marriage of two minds and two bodies. From this it is clear why marriages are heavenly and adulteries infernal; for marriage is an image of heaven, and love truly conjugial is an image of the Lord, while adultery is an image of hell, and love of adultery is an image of the devil. Moreover, conjugial love appears in the spiritual world in form like an angel, and the love of adultery in form like a devil.

By the last judgment all that are in these plagues, that is, in the evils and falsities that have devastated the church, are cast into hell, and thus the new church which is then to be established is cleansed of them. This makes clear the signification of “having authority over these plagues.” (Continuation respecting the Sixth Commandment) [2] How profane and thus how much to be detested adulteries are can be seen from the holiness of marriage. All things in the human body, from the head to the heel of the foot, both interior and exterior, correspond to the heavens, and in consequence man is a heaven in its least form, and also angels and spirits are in form perfectly human, for they are forms of heaven. All the members devoted to generation in both sexes, especially the womb, correspond to societies of the third or inmost heaven, and for the reason that love truly conjugial is derived from the Lord’s love for the church, and from the love of good and truth which is the love of the angels of the third heaven; therefore conjugial love, which descends therefrom as the love of the heavens, is innocence, which is the very being (esse) of every good in the heavens. And for this reason embryos in the womb are in a state of peace, and after birth infants are in a state of innocence; so, too, is the mother in relation to them. [3] As this is the correspondence of the genital organs of both sexes, it is evident that from creation they are holy, and therefore they are devoted solely to chaste and pure conjugial love, and are not to be profaned by the unchaste and impure love of adultery, by which man converts the heaven with himself into hell; for as the love of marriage corresponds to the love of the highest heaven, which is love to the Lord from the Lord, so the love of adultery corresponds to the love of the lowest hell.

But the love of adultery has its beginning in the ultimates of man from an impure lascivious fire there, and thus, contrary to order, penetrates towards the interiors, always into the things that are man’s own, which are nothing but evil, and brings these into a form of hell, which is an image of the devil. Therefore a man who loves adultery and turns away from marriage is in form a devil. [4] As the organs of generation in each sex correspond to the societies of the third heaven, and the love of a marriage pair corresponds to the love of good and truth, so those organs and that love correspond to the Word. The reason is that the Word is the Divine truth united to the Divine good proceeding from the Lord; and this is why the Lord is called “the Word,” also why in every particular of the Word there is a marriage of good and truth, or a heavenly marriage. That there is such a correspondence is an arcanum not yet known in the world, but it has been made evident and proved to me by much experience. From this also it is clear how holy and heavenly marriages are in themselves, and how profane and diabolical adulteries are. And for this reason adulterers make no account of Divine truths and thus of the Word, and if they were to speak from the heart they would even blaspheme the holy things that are in the Word. This they do when they have become spirits after death, for every spirit is compelled to speak from the heart that his interior thoughts may be revealed. 986.

This follows also from what is said before, that “the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun,” which signifies the state of the church manifested as to love (see above n. 981); consequently the vial poured out by this angel upon the throne of the beast signifies manifestation of the state of the church as to faith, since love and faith are what constitute the church, but only when they are one and not two. But “the throne of the beast” means such faith as there is at this day in that church, which is faith separated from the goods of life. [2] The doctrine of faith is meant by “the throne of the beast,” because “throne” means in the highest sense heaven and the church as to the Divine truth; and in the Christian Church the Divine truth is called faith; which was not done in the ancient churches, in which they did not know what faith is since faith involves something that is not understood and yet must be believed as if it were truth. Nearly everything of the church and of its doctrine at the present day is such; as for instance, what must be believed about the trinity, that there are three Persons of the Divinity, that the Lord was born from eternity, that the Holy Spirit proceeds from them, and that this proceeding is a Person which is God by Himself, and yet that there are not three but one, and thus that there is a trinity in the unity, and a unity in the trinity; furthermore, that faith is saving apart from its life, which is from the goods of charity or from good works; that to one who has been justified by faith alone, all works even such as are evil are pardoned,"

That is called adultery where its love reigns, which is called the love of adultery, whether it be within matrimony or out of it, and that is called marriage where its love reigns, which is called conjugial love. Whether the earth might be filled with inhabitants by fornications and adulteries as well as by marriages will be further considered in the following article. [6] When procreations of the human race are effected by marriages in which the holy love of good and truth from the Lord reigns, then it is on earth as it is in the heavens, and the Lord’s kingdom on earth corresponds to the Lord’s kingdom in the heavens. For the heavens consist of societies arranged according to all the varieties of celestial and spiritual affections, from which arrangement the form of heaven springs, and this preeminently surpasses all other forms in the universe. There would be a like form on the earth if the procreations there were effected by marriages in which love truly conjugial reigned; for then, however many families might descend in succession from one head of a family, there would spring forth as many images of the societies of heaven in a like variety. Families would then be like fruit-bearing trees of various kinds, forming as many different gardens, each containing its own kind of fruit, and these gardens taken together would present the form of a heavenly paradise. This is said in the way of comparison, because “trees” signify men of the church, “gardens” intelligence, “fruits” goods of life, and “paradise” heaven. I have been told from heaven that with the most ancient people, from whom the first church on this globe was established, which was called by ancient writers the golden age, there was such a correspondence between families on the earth and societies in the heavens, because love to the Lord, mutual love, innocence, peace, wisdom, and chastity in marriage then reigned; and it was also told me from heaven that they were then inwardly horrified at adulteries, as at the abominable things of hell."

This is evident from the signification of “kingdom,” as being the church as to truths (see n. 48, 683, 684, 685); also from the signification of “darkness,” as being falsities (see n. 526a, b), here mere and dense falsities, because it is added, “even so that they gnawed their tongues and blasphemed the God of heaven because of their distresses and sores.” That through faith alone, that is, through faith separated from good works, all the truths of the church have been banished, and mere falsities have been introduced in their place, has been frequently shown above. Nor can it be otherwise when life is separated from faith, and is thus shut out from religion. (Continuation respecting the Sixth Commandment) [2] That heaven is from marriages and hell from adulteries has been shown above. What this means shall now be told. The hereditary evils into which man is born are not from Adam’s having eaten of the tree of knowledge, but from the adulteration of good and the falsification of truth by parents, thus from the marriage of evil and falsity, from which the love of adultery exists. The ruling love of parents by means of an offshoot is derived from them and transcribed into the offspring and becomes its nature. If the love of the parents is the love of adultery it is also the love of evil for falsity and of falsity for evil. From this source man has all evil, and from evil he has hell. All this makes clear that it is from adulteries that man has hell, unless he is reformed by the Lord by means of truths and a life according to them. And no one can be reformed unless he shuns adulteries as infernal and loves marriages as heavenly. In this and in no other way is hereditary evil broken and rendered milder in the offspring. [3] It is to be noted, however, that while from adulterous parents man is born a hell, he is not born for hell but for heaven. For the Lord provides that no one shall be condemned to hell on account of hereditary evils, but only on account of the evils that the man has actually made his own by his life, as can be seen from the lot of infants after death, all of whom are adopted by the Lord, educated under His auspices in heaven, and saved. This makes clear that every man is born not for hell but for heaven, although from"

Becoming an adulterer means living in the marriage of evil and falsity by thinking evils and falsities from a delight in them and by doing them from a love for them. Every man who does this becomes an adulterer. It is from Divine justice that no one is punished for the evils of his parents, but for his own; therefore the Lord provides that hereditary evils shall not return after death, but one’s own evils, and it is for those that return that a man is then punished. 990. And they gnawed their tongues for distress, signifies that from loathing they are unwilling to perceive and know genuine goods and truths. This is evident from the signification of “gnawing their tongues,” as being to be unwilling to perceive and know genuine goods and truths (of which presently); also from the signification of “distress,” as being loathing. “Gnawing their tongues” signifies to be unwilling to perceive and know genuine goods and truths, because the “tongue” signifies perception of truth, and “to gnaw the tongue” to repress it. For the tongue has various significations, because it is an organ both of speech and of taste; as an organ of speech it signifies confession, thought, and religion; and as an organ of taste it signifies the natural perception of good and truth; while the sense of smell corresponds to the spiritual perception of good and truth. For the tongue tastes and relishes foods and drinks; and foods and drinks signify the goods and truths which nourish the natural mind. To be unwilling to have that perception, or to be unwilling to perceive genuine goods and truths, is signified by “gnawing their tongues.” This has been said of those who separate faith from the goods of life; for they bring together all things of the church or of religion into one article of faith; and contend that by this man is justified. And as man is justified and saved by this alone, it follows that they loathe the remaining things of faith, which are truths of the church, even so as to be unwilling to perceive or to know them; for they say in their heart, “Of what use are these when this one thing is what saves, namely, that God the Father sent the Son, who has redeemed me from hell by the passion of the cross? Therefore the works of the law neither condemn nor save me, because I am saved simply by thinking and believing this with confidence.” This, then, is why they are unwilling from"

They are nauseated at them, because being in faith alone they have an inward antagonism to the goods and truths of heaven and the church, also because these goods and truths are subjects of interior thought, and therefore transcend their material ideas. This loathing and nausea are here signified by “distress.” (Continuation respecting the Sixth Commandment) [2] It has been said abode that the difference between the love of marriage and the love of adultery is like that between heaven and hell. There is a like difference between the delights of these loves; for delights derive their all from the loves from which they spring. The delights of the love of adultery derive what they are from the delights of doing evil uses, thus of evil doing; and the delights of the love of marriage from the delights of doing good uses, thus of well doing. Therefore such as the delight of the evil is in doing evil such is the delight of their love of adultery; because the love of adultery descends therefrom. That it descends from that scarcely anyone can believe; and yet such is its origin. From this it is evident that the delight of adultery ascends from the lowest hell. But the delight of the love of marriage, since it is from the love of the conjunction of good and truth and from the love of doing good, is a heavenly delight; and it comes down from the inmost or third heaven, where love to the Lord from the Lord reigns. [3] From this it can be seen that the difference between these two delights is like that between heaven and hell. And yet, what is wonderful, it is believed that the delight of marriage and the delight of adultery are similar; nevertheless the difference between them is such as has now been described. But the difference can be discerned and felt only by one who is in the delight of conjugial love. One who is in that delight very clearly feels that in the delight of marriage there is nothing impure or unchaste, thus nothing lascivious; and that in the delight of adultery there is nothing but what is impure, unchaste, and lascivious. He feels that unchastity comes up from beneath, and that chastity comes down from above. But one who is in the delight of adultery is incapable of feeling this, because he feels what is infernal as his heavenly. From all this it"

Verse 11. And they blasphemed the God of heaven, signifies the falsification of the Word. This is evident from the signification of “blaspheming,” when predicated of God, as being to falsify the Word even to the destruction of the Divine truth in the heavens (see n. 778); also from the signification of “the God of heaven,” as being the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord. This is the meaning of “the God of heaven” here and elsewhere in the Word, because the whole heaven consists of that Divine; and this is why angels are called “gods,” and why they signify the Divine truths that are from the Lord; this also is why the Lord is called “the Word,” which is the Divine truth, and why here the words “they blasphemed the God of heaven” signify the falsification of the Word even to the destruction of the Divine truth in the heavens. (Continuation respecting the Sixth Commandment) [2] It has been said that conjugial love, which is natural, descends from the love of good and truth, which is spiritual; this spiritual therefore is in the natural love of marriage as a cause is in its effect. So from the marriage of good and truth there exists the love of bearing fruit, namely, good through truth and truth from good; and from that love the love of producing offspring descends, in which there is all delight and pleasure. On the contrary, the love of adultery, which is natural, exists from the love of evil and falsity, which is spiritual; consequently this spiritual is in the natural love of adultery as a cause is in its effect. So from the marriage of evil and falsity by love there exists the love of bearing fruit, namely, evil through falsity and falsity from evil; and from that love descends"

[3] There is every delight and pleasure in the love of producing offspring, because all that is delightful, pleasurable, blessed and happy, in the whole heaven and in the whole world, has been from creation brought together in the effort and thus into the act of producing uses; and these joys increase in an ascending degree to eternity, according to the goodness and excellence of the uses. This makes evident why the pleasure of producing offspring, which surpasses every other pleasure, is so great. It surpasses every other because its use, which is the procreation of the human race, and thus of heaven, surpasses all other uses. [4] From this, too, comes the pleasure and delight of adultery; but as prolification through adulteries corresponds to the production of evil through falsity and of falsity from evil, that pleasure or delight decreases and becomes vile by degrees until it is changed at last into loathing and nausea. Because, as has been said above, the delight of the love of marriage is a heavenly delight, and the delight of adultery is an infernal delight, so the delight of adultery is from a certain impure fire, which as long as it lasts, counterfeits the delight of the love of good, but in itself it is the delight of the love of evil, which is in its essence the delight of hatred against good and truth. And because this is its origin there is no love between an adulterer and an adulteress except such as the love of hatred is, which is such that they can be in conjunction in externals but not in internals. For in the externals there is something fiery, but in the internals there is icy coldness; therefore after a short time the fire is extinguished and icy coldness succeeds, either with impotence or with aversion as from one filthy. [5] It has been granted me to see that love in its essence, and it was such that within it was deadly hatred, while without it appeared like a fire from burning dung and putrid and stinking matters.

[6] What the delight of hatred and thus of doing evil is with those who are in hell can neither be described nor believed. To do evil is the joy of their heart, and this they call their heaven. Their delight in doing evil derives its all from hatred and vindictiveness against good and truth; when, therefore, they are moved by a deadly and diabolical hatred they rage against heaven, especially against those who are from heaven and who worship the Lord; for they violently burn to slaughter them, and because they cannot destroy their bodies they will to destroy their souls. It is, therefore, the delight of hatred which, becoming a fire in the extremes and being injected into the lusting flesh, becomes for the moment the delight of adultery—the soul in which the hatred lies concealed then withdrawing itself. It is for this reason that hell is called adultery, and also that adulterers are desperately unmerciful, savage and cruel. This, then, is the infernal marriage. [7] As adultery is fiery in the externals but cold in the internals, and as therefore the internal does not produce the external, as it does in marriages, but they mutually act against each other, so the man feels impotence if the woman desires the act, and still more if she importunes it; for the internal which is cold then comes into the effort and flows into what is fiery in the externals and extinguishes it, and so casts it off as unfit. Add to this that the lust of violating, which also enkindles that impure fire, then perishes. 992.

Nausea is signified because pain from the sores on account of which they blasphemed the God of heaven is meant, and yet not pain on that account, but nausea for truths and for the goods therefrom. (Continuation respecting the Sixth Commandment) [2] It has been said that the love of adultery is a fire enkindled from impurities that soon burns out and is turned into cold, and into an aversion corresponding to hatred. But the reverse is true of the love of marriage. This is a fire enkindled from the love of good and truth and from the delight in well-doing, thus from love to the Lord and from love towards the neighbor. This fire, which from its origin is heavenly, is full of innumerable delights, as many, in fact, as are the delights and blessednesses of heaven. It has been told me that the charms and pleasantnesses of that love which are manifested from time to time are so many and such that they cannot be numbered or described. Moreover, they are multiplied with continual increase to eternity. These delights have their origin in the fact that the married pair wish to be united into one as to their minds, and into such a union heaven breathes from the marriage of good and truth from the Lord in heaven. [3] I will here say something about the marriages of angels in heaven. They declare that they are in continual potency, that after the acts there is never any weariness, still less any sadness, but eagerness of life and cheerfulness of mind, that the married pair pass the night in each other’s bosoms as if they were created into one, that effects are constantly open, that they are never lacking when they have desire, since without these their love would be like the channel of a fountain stopped up. The effect opens that channel and causes continuance and conjunction that they may become as one flesh; for the vital of the husband adds itself to the vital of the wife and binds together. They declare that the delights of the effects cannot be described in the expressions of any language in the natural world, nor be thought of in any except spiritual ideas, and that even these do not exhaust them. These things have been told me by the angels."

This is evident from the signification of “repenting,” as being to live a different life; also from the signification of “their works,” as being evils from falsities. For those who separate faith from works do evils from falsities, in that they say that as works are from man they are not good but are meritorious, and therefore must not be joined with faith, which is spiritual and justifying. For a man can do nothing that is good from a false principle; and where there is no good there is evil. It is otherwise when a man lives according to the Lord’s commandments, which are, that evils must be refrained from and goods must be done. Therefore “they repented not of their works” signifies not to be willing to live according to the Lord’s commandments. (Continuation respecting the Sixth Commandment) [2] That true conjugial love contains in itself so many ineffable delights that can neither be numbered nor described can be seen from the fact that this love is the fundamental love of all celestial and spiritual loves, since through that love man becomes love; for from it each of the marriage pair loves the other as good loves truth and truth loves good, thus representatively as the Lord loves heaven and the church. Such love can exist only through a marriage in which the man is truth and the wife is good. When a man through marriage has become such love he is also in love to the Lord and in love towards the neighbor, and thus in the love of all good and in the love of all truth. For from man as love there must proceed loves of every kind; therefore conjugial love is the fundamental love of all the loves of heaven. And as it is the fundamental love of all the loves of heaven it is also the fundamental of all the delights and joys of heaven, since every delight and joy is of love. From this it follows that heavenly joys, in their order and in their degrees, have their origins and their causes from conjugial love. [3] From the felicities of marriages a conclusion may be drawn respecting the infelicities of adulteries, namely, that the love of adultery is the fundamental love of all infernal loves, which are in themselves not loves, but hatreds; consequently from the love of adultery hatreds of every kind gush forth, both against God and"

This is evident from the signification of “the angel pouring out the vial,” as being the state of the church manifested (as often above); also from the signification of “Euphrates,” as being the rational (see above, n. 569), which is called “a great river” from the intelligence that man has from the rational, for “river” signifies intelligence (see n. 518). All the intelligence of the natural man is from his rational, for the rational is the medium between the spiritual and the natural; and because it is the medium, it first receives influx from the spiritual world and transfers it into the natural. From this it follows that before the spiritual mind, which is called the spiritual man, can be opened, and through it influx into the natural mind be given, the rational must be cultivated, which is done by means of knowledges, which are natural and moral truths, and by means of cognitions of truth and good from the Word. Through these the rational mind is opened from below. But as soon as the spiritual mind has been opened, and there is influx from that, the rational mind is opened from above; and thus the rational, as an intermediate, furnishes a passage; and then through it the natural mind, which contains knowledges and cognitions, is subordinated to the spiritual mind, and thus to heaven and the Lord."

It is from the Lord alone because it descends from the Lord’s love for heaven and the church, and thus from the love of good and truth; for good is from the Lord, and truth is in heaven and the church; and from this it follows that true conjugial love in its first essence is love to the Lord. And from this it is that no one can be in true conjugial love and its pleasantnesses, delights, happiness, and joys, unless he acknowledges the Lord alone, that is, that the trinity is in Him. He who approaches the Father as a person by Himself, or the Holy Spirit as a person by Himself, and these not in the Lord, can have no conjugial love. The genuine conjugial is given especially in the third heaven, because the angels there are in love to the Lord, they acknowledge Him alone as God, and they do His commandments. To them doing the commandments is loving the Lord. To them the Lord’s commandments are the truths in which they receive Him. There is conjunction of the Lord with them, and of them with the Lord; for they are in the Lord because they are in good, and the Lord is in them because they are in truths. This is the heavenly marriage, from which true conjugial love descends. 996. And the water thereof was dried up, signifies that falsities were removed. This is evident from the signification of “waters,” as being truths, and in the contrary sense falsities (see n. 518), here falsities, for it is added, “that the way of the kings from the rising of the sun might be prepared,” which signifies that the Divine truth from the Lord might flow in. Also from the signification of “being dried up,” as meaning to be removed. This describes the state of man as to the rational. It is from the rational that man can see and understand truths; and so far as he can see truths, so far falsities from evils do not obstruct. For every man, even an evil man, has the faculty of understanding truths (see above, n. 874, 970); but man does not see them, nor does he understand them because he loves evil, and evil brings in falsity, and afterwards when truth has fallen into falsity, truth can no longer appear in its own light, for it is blunted, obscured, suffocated, and rejected. But in the first age of man falsities from evils do not enter, and thus do not obstruct. But they enter in his second and third age, when he no longer thinks from the memory alone or from a master, but from his own"

From this it is clear that falsities are in the meantime removed, and then the knowledges of good and truth from the Word enter; and these the man sees in a certain light apart from falsities. But afterwards the rational sight is perverted by reasonings from fallacies and from falsities which is signified by “three unclean spirits like frogs” that went forth out of the mouth of the dragon and of the beast and of the false prophet, which are treated of in what follows. The nearest sense of the words, that “the water of the river Euphrates was dried up, that the way of the kings from the rising of the sun might be prepared,” is that a passage might be given from the church, where Divine truths are, which the dragon, the beast, and the false prophet wished to pervert. For the Euphrates was a boundary of the land of Canaan on one side and separated it from Assyria; and “the land of Canaan” signifies the church, and “Assyria” the rational. (Continuation respecting the Sixth Commandment) [2] As true conjugial love in its first essence is love to the Lord from the Lord it is also innocence. Innocence is loving the Lord as one’s Father by doing His commandments and wishing to be led by Him and not by oneself, thus like an infant. As that love is innocence, it is the very being of all good; and therefore man has so much of heaven in himself, or he is so much in heaven, as he is in conjugial love, because he is so far in innocence. It is because true conjugial love is innocence that the playfulness between a married pair is like the play of infants together; and this is so in the measure in which they love each other, as is evident in the case of all in the first days after the nuptials, when their love emulates true conjugial love. The innocence of conjugial love is meant in the Word by the “nakedness” at which Adam and his wife blushed not; and for the reason that there is nothing of lasciviousness, and thus nothing of shame, between a married pair, any more than between little children when they are naked together. 997. That the way of the kings from the rising of the sun might be prepared, signifies that the Divine truth from the Lord might flow in.

The influx of Divine truth is meant because it is called “the way of the kings from the rising of the sun,” for “ways” signify influx, since all influx from one society to another, thus from the Lord, is through ways opened in the spiritual world. And since “the rising of the sun” signifies where the Lord is, so “from the rising of the sun” means from the Lord. That the Lord is the sun of heaven, and therefore the “sun” means in the Word the Lord as to love, may be seen above (n. 401a-e, 412b, 527). (That “the east” and “the rising of the sun” mean where the Lord is, see n. 422; and that “kings” signify Divine truths, n. 29, 31, 553, 625.) What these words mean in the nearest sense has been told above, namely, that a way might be opened from the land of Canaan, which signifies the spiritual of the church, to Assyria, which signifies the rational of the church. The river Euphrates separated and bounded these countries. So “the way of the kings from the rising of the sun” signifies a passage from the church; and that this was opened is meant in that sense by “the water of the Euphrates was dried up.” [2] Something shall now be said about the influx into men of Divine truth from the Lord. From the Lord as a sun both heat and light proceed; but the heat is Divine good, and the light is Divine truth. The light, which is Divine truth, flows into and enters into every angel of heaven, and also into every man in the world, and gives internal sight, which is the sight of the understanding. For every man, not as to his body but as to his spirit, has a faculty for receiving that light, that is, for understanding the Divine truth. And that faculty is opened as the man grows up, and cultivates and forms his rational according to order, by the knowledges and by the cognitions of good and truth. But the heat, which is Divine good, does not flow into an angel or a man as the light, which is Divine truth, does, for the reason that man is born into evils of every kind, and evils obstruct; consequently evils must first be removed before the heat, which is Divine good, can flow in; and evils are removed by looking upon them as sins against God and shunning them, by praying to the Lord for help; and so far as a man thus receives Divine good so far he comes into the light of understanding Divine truth. For the way of Divine truth into a man who is reformed is through the good of the will, and of the life therefrom with him."

A man is in a state separate when he is held solely in the thought that belongs to his understanding and not at the same time in the affection that belongs to his will. But in this state man is not reformed, because the light does not then affect his life, that is, Divine truth is not then implanted. But man is in a state not separate when he is held in thought from the understanding and at the same time in affection from the will; and in that state man does not receive light, that is, does not understand Divine truth, unless he is at the same time in Divine good as to the affection of the will, for in that state evils that belong to the will and the consequent falsities that belong to the thought obstruct and extinguish the light. But of these two states of man more will be said hereafter. (Continuation respecting the Sixth Commandment) [4] Since conjugial love in its first essence is love to the Lord from the Lord, and thus is innocence, conjugial love is also peace, such as the angels in the heavens have. For as innocence is the very being of all good, so peace is the very being of all delight from good, consequently is the very being of all joy between the marriage pair. As then, all joy is of love, and conjugial love is the fundamental love of all the loves of heaven, so peace itself has its seat chiefly in conjugial love. Peace is happiness of heart and soul arising from the conjunction of the Lord with heaven and the church, as well as from the conjunction of good and truth, when all conflict and combat of evil and falsity with good and truth has ceased, as may be seen above (n. 365). And as conjugial love descends from such conjunction so all the delight of that love descends and derives its essence from heavenly peace. Moreover, this peace shines forth in the heavens as heavenly happiness from the faces of a marriage pair who are in that love, and who mutually regard each other from that love. But such heavenly happiness, which inmostly affects the delights of loves, and is called peace, can be granted only to those who can be joined together inmostly, that is, as to their very hearts."

And I saw out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth of the beast, signifies from the thought, reasoning, religion, and doctrine of those who are in faith alone, and in confirmations of that faith from the natural man. This is evident from the signification of the “mouth,” as being thought, reasoning, religion, and doctrine (see n. 580, 782, 794); also from the signification of the “dragon,” as being those who are in faith alone both as to doctrine and as to life (see n. 714-716, 737); also from the signification of the “beast,” as being those who confirm faith alone by reasonings from the natural man (see n. 773). For there were two beasts, one coming up out of the sea, the other out of the earth; and “the beast out of the sea” means faith alone confirmed by reasonings from the natural man; and “the beast out of the earth” means that faith confirmed from the sense of the letter of the Word, and its consequent falsification. But here “the beast coming up out of the sea” is meant, that is, faith confirmed by reasonings; since it is added, “out of the mouth of the false prophet,” and “the false prophet” has the same signification as “the beast out of the earth,” namely, faith alone confirmed by the Word, thus the doctrine of falsity from falsified truths. [2] This and what here follows describes how the doctrine of faith alone has blunted and almost extinguished the faculty of understanding the Divine truth, which is given to every man by the Lord so far as falsities from evil do not block up influx and access, lest anything should be perceived from heaven. For a man is like a garden, which receives light in winter equally as in summer, but not heat; and yet when it does receive heat it blossoms and bears fruit. So the evil man equally with the good man is able to receive light, that is, to understand Divine truth, but he cannot blossom and become fruitful, that is, be wise and do works that are good, except as he receives heat, that is, the good of love. [3] There are many who believe that the learned, since they know many things from the Word and from doctrine from the Word, are more intelligent and wise than others; and yet they have only so much intelligence and wisdom as they have spiritual heat, that is, the good of love, for only so far is their faculty of understanding truths opened and vivified; while that faculty is as it were covered"

That they have, nevertheless, this intellectual faculty, however covered up and blotted out, I have frequently heard proved by experiment. There were spirits who were wholly in falsities from evil, and who in their heart denied the Divine influx into all things of the understanding of truth and of the will of good, that is, denied the Divine Providence, and thus they confirmed with themselves that all things are of nature and of their own prudence. Although these spirits had as it were no faculty of understanding truths when they thought about them with themselves, yet when they heard from others that the Divine is everything, and that the natural is relatively nothing except as a tool is to a workman, they understood all this as clearly as those did who taught it, or as others did who had confirmed themselves in that Divine truth. But the moment they turned away their ear they fell back into things contrary, and no longer understood these truths, because they covered them up with falsities from confirmations. This clearly showed that all have the faculty of understanding the truth or of receiving light from heaven; and yet they receive only so far as by life they are in the good of love; the same as a garden that admits light from the sun in winter equally as in summer, and yet it blossoms and bears fruit only so far as it receives at the same time heat from the sun, which it does in spring and summer. (Continuation respecting the Sixth Commandment) [4] Man has such and so much of intelligence and wisdom as he has of conjugial love. The reason is that conjugial love descends from the love of good and truth as an effect does from its cause, or as the natural from its spiritual; and from the marriage of good and truth the angels of the three heavens have all their intelligence and wisdom; for intelligence and wisdom are nothing else than the reception of light and heat from the Lord as a sun, that is, the reception of Divine truth conjoined to Divine good, and of Divine good conjoined to Divine truth; thus it is the marriage of good and truth from the Lord. That it is so has been made clearly evident by angels in the heavens. When these are separated from their consorts they are indeed in intelligence, but not in wisdom; but when they are with their consorts they are also in wisdom; and what is"

By intelligence and wisdom ingenuity in reasoning about truths and goods is not meant, but the faculty of seeing and understanding truths and goods, and this faculty man has from the Lord. 999. And out of the mouth of the false prophet, signifies the doctrine of faith separated from life, and of justification by it confirmed from the Word falsified. This is evident from the signification of “the false prophet,” as being the doctrine of falsity from truths of the Word falsified. This is signified by the “false prophet” because a “prophet” means the doctrine of truth from the Word, and in the highest sense the Word (see above, n. 624); so a “false prophet” means the contrary of this. Moreover, “the false prophet” here has the same signification as “the beast coming up out of the earth,” for it is said, “out of the mouth of the beast and of the false prophet.” For there were two beasts by which the dragon has been further described, one seen coming up “out of the sea,” the other “out of the earth”; and “the beast out of the sea” signifies confirmations of faith separated from the life by reasonings from the natural man, but “the beast out of the earth” signifies confirmations from the Word of faith separated from the life, and the consequent falsifications of the Word. And because the doctrine of the church was made from this, and that doctrine teaches the separation of faith from the life and justification by that separated faith, so this second beast is meant by “the false prophet.” (Continuation respecting the Sixth Commandment) [2] From true conjugial love there is power and protection against the hells, because it is against the evils and falsities that ascend from the hells, and for the reason that through conjugial love man has conjunction with the Lord, and the Lord alone has power over all the hells; also because through conjugial love man has heaven and the church; consequently as the Lord unceasingly protects heaven and the church from the evils and falsities that rise"

And this is why through conjugial love man has peace, which is inmost joy of heart from a complete safety from the hells and a protection from infestations of the evil and falsity therefrom. 1000. Three unclean spirits like frogs, signifies reasonings from mere falsities against Divine truths. This is evident from the signification of “unclean spirits,” as being falsities of evil which are from hell; for all who are in the hells are unclean from falsities of evil, for the reason that all unclean things exist from the falsities that are from evil, and all clean things from the truths that are from good. Also from the signification of “three,” as being all things and fullness, and as being applied either to truths or to falsities (see n. 435a, 506, 532, 658); and because of this “three” signifies wholly and merely, and here, mere falsity. Also from the signification of “frogs,” as being reasonings from falsities. Frogs have this signification not only because of their croaking, but also because they live in bogs and fetid pools; and for the same reason they signify infernal falsities. For those who reason from falsities against Divine truths live in hells that appear like bogs and fetid pools; and those who are there, when they are seen in the light of heaven, resemble frogs, some in a larger and some in a smaller form according to their elation of mind arising from more or less keenness of reasoning. They are also more or less unclean according as their reasonings are against more or less interior and important Divine truths. [2] That “frogs” signify reasonings from mere falsities against Divine truths can be seen from the miracle of the frogs in Egypt. For all the miracles there performed signify the plagues or evils with which those are affected after death who fight against spiritual goods and truths and endeavor to destroy them by means of the knowledges of the natural man.

The things of the natural man have reference to evils and falsities, and evils have reference to the love, and falsities to its doctrine; while the things of the spiritual man have reference to the goods that belong to the love and to the truths that belong to its doctrine. That “frogs” here signify the reasonings from falsities of the natural man against the truths of the spiritual man is evident from the description of that miracle in Moses: He caused the river to swarm with frogs, and they went up and came into the house of Pharaoh and into his bed-chamber and upon his bed, and into the house of his servants and of his people, and into the ovens and the kneading troughs. And when they were dead they were gathered into heaps, and the land stank (Exod. 7:27–29; 8:1–14). That “frogs” here signify the reasonings from falsities of the natural man against Divine truths can be seen from the explanation of all this in the Arcana Coelestia (n. 7345–7357, 7379–7409). [3] Also in David: He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish. He caused frogs to creep forth upon their lands, into the chambers of their kings (Ps. 105:29, 30). This is said of the plagues in Egypt. “The waters turned into blood” signify truths falsified; “the fishes slain” signify factual truths and cognitions of the natural man, that they perished; “the frogs creeping forth upon their lands” signify reasonings of the natural man from falsities; “chambers of the kings” signify interior truths, which they perverted by reasonings from falsities, “chambers” being interior things, and “kings” truths. “The frogs that came up into the house of Pharaoh, into his bed-chamber, and upon his bed,” have a similar signification. All this makes clear what is signified by “three unclean spirits like frogs, which went forth out of the mouth of the dragon, of the beast, and of the false prophet.\""

Each partner returns to the flower and joys of the age when conjugial love begins to exalt the life with new delights, and to inspire playfulness for the sake of prolification. The man who while he lived in the world had shunned adulteries as sins, and who has been inaugurated by the Lord into conjugial love, comes into this state first exteriorly and afterwards more and more interiorly to eternity. As such continue to grow young more interiorly it follows that true conjugial love continually increases and enters into its charms and satisfactions, which have been provided for it from the creation of the world, and which are the charms and satisfactions of the inmost heaven, arising from the love of the Lord for heaven and the church, and thus from the love of good for truth and truth for good, which loves are the source of every joy in the heavens. Man thus grows young in heaven because he then enters into the marriage of good and truth; and in good there is the conatus to love truth continually, and in truth there is the conatus to love good continually; and then the wife is good in form and the husband is truth in form.

This is evident from the signification of “unclean spirits like frogs,” as being reasonings from mere falsities against Divine truths (see just above, n. 1000); also from the signification of “demons,” as being things that are from hell. For in hell those are called “demons” who are in the lust of falsifying truths, and this is done chiefly by reasonings; therefore “demons and demoniacs” signify in an abstract sense lusts and falsities, as can be seen from the passages in the Word where they are mentioned (as in Lev. 17:7; Deut. 32:17; Isa. 13:21; 34:14; Ps. 106:37; Matt. 4:24; 8:16, 28, 31; 9:32, 33; 10:8; 12:22; 15:22; Mark 1:32, 34, 39; Luke 4:33–38, 41; 8:2, 26–40; 9:1, 37–42, 49; 13:32; Rev. 9:20; 18:2). (Continuation respecting the Sixth Commandment) From conjugial love angels have all their beauty; thus each angel has beauty in the measure of that love. For all angels are forms of their affections; for the reason that it is not permitted in heaven to counterfeit with the face things that do not belong to one’s affection; consequently their faces are types of their minds. When, therefore, they have conjugial love, love to the Lord, mutual love, love of good and love of truth, and love of wisdom, these loves in them give form to their faces, and show themselves like vital fires in their eyes; to which innocence and peace add themselves, which complete their beauty. Such are the forms of the inmost angelic heaven; and they are truly human forms. 1002. Doing signs, signifies persuading by fallacies and sophistries.

This is the signification of “signs,” because it is added that they were “to go away unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to battle,” which signifies to excite dissensions and combats against truths in the whole church. (Continuation respecting the Sixth Commandment) [2] From what has been thus far presented what the good is that results from chastity in marriage can be inferred, consequently what the good works of chastity are that a man does who shuns adulteries as sins against God. The good works of chastity concern either the married pair themselves, or their offspring and posterity, or the heavenly societies. The good works of chastity that concern the married pair themselves are spiritual and celestial loves, intelligence and wisdom, innocence and peace, power and protection against the hells and against the evils and the falsities therefrom, and manifold joys and felicities to eternity. Those who live in chaste marriages, as before described, have all these. The good works of chastity that concern the offspring and posterity are that so many and so great evils do not become innate in families. For the ruling love of parents is transmitted into the offspring and sometimes to remote posterity, and becomes their hereditary nature. This is broken and softened with parents who shun adulteries as infernal and love marriages as heavenly. [3] The good works of chastity that concern the heavenly societies are that chaste marriages are the delights of heaven, that they are its seminaries, and that they are its supports. They supply delights to heaven by communications; they are seminaries to heaven by producing offspring; and they are supports to heaven by their power against the hells; for at the presence of conjugial love diabolical spirits become furious, insane, and mentally impotent, and cast themselves into the deep."

Of that great day of God Almighty, signifies the last state of the church, when the Lord comes and the last judgment takes place. This is evident from the signification of “the great day of God Almighty,” as being the last state of the church, when the Lord comes and the last judgment takes place (see n. 413). Frequent mention is made in the Word of “the great day,” “the day of Jehovah,” “the day of anger and wrath,” “the day of vengeance,” “the terrible day\"; and this means in these passages the last state of the church, and then the coming of the Lord and the last judgment. (Continuation respecting the Sixth Commandment) [2] True conjugial love cannot be given except between two, like the Lord’s love towards heaven, which is one from Him and in Him, or towards the church, which like heaven is one from Him and in Him. All who are in the heavens and who are in the church must be one through mutual love from love to the Lord. An angel in heaven and a man in the church who does not thus make one with the rest is not of heaven nor of the church.

When these are one, good is in truth and truth is in good, and truth is of good and good is of truth; thus one acknowledges the other as its mutual and reciprocal, or as an agent recognizes its reagent, each in its turn. This universal marriage is the source of conjugial love between husband and wife. The husband has been so created as to be the understanding of truth, and the wife so created as to be the will of good, and thus the husband to be truth and the wife good; thus that both may be truth and good in form, which form is man, and the image of God. And because it is from creation that truth should be of good, and good of truth, thus mutually and reciprocally, therefore it is impossible for one truth to be united to two diverse goods, or the reverse; neither is it possible for one understanding to be united to two diverse wills, or the reverse; neither for one person who is spiritual to be united to two diverse churches; neither in like manner for one man (vir) to be inmostly united to two women. Inmost union is like that of soul and heart; the soul of the wife is the husband, and the heart of the husband is the wife. The husband communicates and conjoins his soul to the wife by actual love; it is in his seed; and the wife receives it in her heart, and from this the two become one, and then each and all things in the body of the one look to their mutual in the body of the other. This is genuine marriage, which is possible only between two. For it is from creation that all things of the husband, both of his mind and of his body, have their mutual in the mind and in the body of the wife; and thus the most particular things look mutually to each other and will to be united. From this looking and conatus conjugial love exists. [3] All things in the body, which are called members, viscera, and organs, are nothing but natural corporeal forms corresponding to the spiritual form of the mind; from this each and all things of the body so correspond to each and all things of the mind that whatever the mind wills and thinks the body at its command instantly brings forth into act. When, therefore, two minds act as one their two bodies are potentially so united that they are no more two but one flesh. To will to become one flesh is conjugial love; and such as the willing is, such is that love."

There are married pairs there in such conjugial love that the two can be one flesh, and are one whenever they wish, and they then appear as one man. I have seen and talked with such; and they said that they have one life, and are like the life of good in truth and the life of truth in good, and are like the pairs in man, that is, like the two hemispheres of the brain enclosed in one membrane, the two ventricles of the heart within a common covering, likewise the two lobes of the lungs; these, although they are two, yet are one in regard to life and the activities of life, which are uses. They said that their life so conjoined is full of heaven, and is the very life of heaven with its infinite beatitudes, for the reason that heaven also is such from the marriage of the Lord with it, for all the angels of heaven are in the Lord and the Lord in them. [5] Furthermore, they said that it is impossible for them to think from any intention about an additional wife or woman, because this would be turning heaven into hell, consequently if an angel merely thinks of such a thing he falls from heaven. They added that natural spirits do not believe such conjunctions as theirs to be possible, for the reason that with those who are merely natural there is no marriage from a spiritual origin, which is of good and truth, but only a marriage from a natural origin; therefore there is no union of minds, but only a union of bodies from a lascivious disposition in the flesh; and this lust is from a universal law impressed upon and thus implanted in everything animate and inanimate from creation. The law is that everything in which there is force wills to produce its like and to multiply its kind to infinity and to eternity. As the posterity of Jacob, who were called the sons of Israel, were merely natural men, and thus their marriages were not spiritual, but carnal, so they were permitted on account of the hardness of their hearts to take several wives. 1005. Verse 15. Behold I come as a thief, signifies the Lord’s coming and the last judgment at that time. This is evident from the signification of “coming as a thief” as being, in reference to the Lord, His coming and the last judgment at that time, as elsewhere in the Word (as Matt. 6:19, 20; 24:42, 43; Obad. verse 5; Joel 2:9; Hos. 7:1).

This is why the Lord’s coming and the last judgment are compared to a thief (see above, n. 193). (Continuation respecting the Sixth Commandment) [2] That adultery is hell, and consequently an abomination, anyone can perceive from the idea of the mixture of diverse seed in the womb of one woman, for in man’s seed there lies hidden the inmost of his life, and thus the rudiment of a new life; and for this reason it is holy. To make this common with the inmosts and rudiments of others, as is done in adulteries, is profane. This is why adultery is hell, and why hell in general is called adultery. And as from such a mixture nothing but corruption, also from a spiritual origin, can exist, it follows that adultery is an abomination. [3] Consequently in the brothels that are in hell, foulnesses of every kind appear; and when light out of heaven is let into them, adulteresses are seen lying with adulterers, like swine in filth itself; and what is wonderful, like swine they are in their delights when they are in the midst of filth. But these brothels are kept closed, because when they are opened a stench is exhaled that excites vomiting. It is otherwise in chaste marriages. In these the life of the husband adds itself through the seed to the life of the wife; and from this there is inmost conjunction, by which they become not two, but one flesh. And according to conjunction by means of that, conjugial love increases, and with it every good of heaven. 1006. Happy is he that is awake, signifies the happy state of those who look to the Lord. This is evident from the signification of “happy,” as being to be in a happy state; also from the signification of “being awake,” as being to acquire for oneself spiritual life (see n. 187); and this is acquired by man’s looking to the Lord, because the Lord is Life itself, and from Him alone is life eternal.

To live this life is meant also by “sleeping and slumbering” in the Word (as in Matt. 13:25; 25:5, 6; Mark 4:26, 27; 13:36; Isa. 5:27; Jer. 51:39, 57; Ps. 13:4; 76:7; and elsewhere). This makes clear what is signified by “being awake.” (Continuation respecting the Sixth Commandment) [2] But it is to be known that adulteries are more and less infernal and abominable. The adulteries that spring from more grievous evils and their falsities are more grievous, and those from the milder evils and their falsities are milder; for adulteries correspond to adulterations of good and consequent falsifications of truth; adulterations of good are in themselves evils, and falsifications of truth are in themselves falsities. According to correspondences with these the hells are arranged into genera and species. There are cadaverous hells for those whose delights were the violations of wives; there are excrementitious hells for those whose delights were the debauching of virgins; there are direful, slimy hells for those whose delights were varieties and changes of harlots; for others there are filthy hells. There are sodomitic hells for those who were in evils from a love of ruling over others from mere delight in ruling, and who were in no delight of use. [3] From those who have separated faith from good works both in doctrine and in life there exhale adulteries like that of a son with a mother or a mother-in-law; from those who have studied the Word only for the sake of glory, and not for the sake of spiritual uses, there exhale adulteries like that of a father with a daughter-in- law; from those who believe that sins are remitted by the Holy Supper, and not by repentance of life, there exhale adulteries like that of a brother with a sister; from those who altogether deny the Divine, there exhale heinous things with beasts; and so on. Such hells are for them because of the correspondence with the adulterations or defilements of good and truth."

This is evident from the signification of “garments,” as being truths covering good (see n. 64, 65, 195, 271, 395, 637); therefore “to keep the garments” signifies to live according to truths, here according to the Lord’s Divine truths in the Word. (Continuation respecting the Sixth Commandment) In brief, from every conjunction of evil and falsity in the spiritual world a sphere of adultery flows forth, but only from those who are in falsities as to doctrine and in evils as to life; but not from those who are in falsities as to doctrine yet are in goods as to life, for with these there is no conjunction of evil and falsity, but only with the former. That sphere flows forth particularly from priests who have taught falsely and lived wickedly; for these have adulterated and falsified the Word. Even though these were not adulterers in the world, adultery is excited by them; but it is an adultery called sacerdotal adultery, which is distinguishable from other adulteries. All this makes clear that the origin of adulteries is the love and consequent conjunction of evil and falsity. 1008. That he may not walk naked, signifies that he may not be without truths, and thus without goods. This is evident from the signification of “naked,” as meaning to be without truth, and thus without good (see n. 240); for those who are without truths are also without goods, since all good is acquired by means of truths; and moreover, good without truth is not good, and truth without good is not truth; that there may be truth it must be conjoined to good, and that there may be good it must be conjoined to truth. There may be indeed truth without good and good without truth; but truth without good is dead, and so is good without truth. For truth has its being (esse) from good, and good has its existence (existere) by means of truth. All this makes clear that “to walk naked” signifies to be without truths, and thus without goods. That “to walk” signifies to be and to live may be seen above (n. 787)."

For the religion and doctrine of faith separated from good works is a reli gion and doctrine of truth separated from good; and truth separated from good is not truth, but interiorly regarded is falsity; and good separated from truth is not good, but interiorly regarded is evil. Consequently in the Christian religion there is the doctrine of falsity and evil, from which origin a desire and favor for adultery from hell flow in; and this is why adulteries are believed in the Christian world to be allowable, and are practiced without shame. For, as has been said above, the conjunction of evil and falsity is spiritual adultery, from which according to correspondence natural adultery exists. For this reason “adulteries and whoredoms” signify in the Word adulterations of good and falsifications of truth; and for this reason Babylon is called in Revelation a “harlot,” and Jerusalem is so called in the Word of the Old Testament; and the Jewish nation was called by the Lord “an adulterous nation,” and “from their father the devil.” (But on this see above from the Word, n. 141.) 1009. And they see his shame, signifies and thus be in filthy loves. This is evident from the signification of “shame” as being filthy loves. For shame (pudor) means the part of the body covered by the breeches, the region of the genitals, which are called pudenda, from scandals and adulteries. “Walking naked” means the nakedness of these; and as the genitals of both sexes correspond to the loves of heaven in general, and this is their correspondence when they are clothed, so when they are not clothed, that is, when they are naked, they correspond to the loves of hell. For “garments” signify truths clothing, and “the flesh” of that region of the body signifies the good of love, and good without truth is not good, as truth without good is not truth (see just above, n. 1008); and where there is no good of love there is evil, that is, filthy love.

(Continuation respecting the Sixth Commandment) [2] He that abstains from adulteries from any other motive than because they are sins and are against God is still an adulterer; as for instance when anyone abstains from them from fear of the civil law and its penalties, from fear of the loss of reputation and thus of honor, from fear of resulting diseases, from fear of upbraidings at home from his wife and consequent intranquility of life, from fear of chastisement by the servants of the injured husband, from poverty, or from avarice; from infirmity arising from abuse or from age or impotence or disease; in fact, when one abstains because of any natural or moral law, and does not at the same time abstain because of the Divine law, he is still interiorly unchaste and an adulterer, since he nonetheless believes that adulteries are not sins, and therefore in his spirit, declares them allowable, and thus he commits them in spirit, although not in the body; consequently after death when he becomes a spirit he speaks openly in favor of them, and commits them without shame. It has been granted me in the spiritual world to see maidens who regarded whoredoms as heinous because they are contrary to the Divine law, and also maidens who did not regard them as heinous and yet abstained from them because the resulting bad name would turn away suitors.

This is evident from the signification of “gathering them together into a place,” that is, for battle, as being to arrange for fighting, from falsities against truths. This means a state of combat, because “place” signifies the state of a thing, and it means from falsities against truths, because it is meant that the dragon gathered them together; for in chapter 12 it is said:"

And here the place where they were to be gathered together and to begin the battle is named. It is believed that Armageddon means Megiddo, where Josiah, king of Judah, fighting against Pharaoh was defeated (see 2 Kings 23:29, 30; 2 Chron. 35:20–24; also Zech. 12). But what “Megiddo” there signifies in the spiritual sense is not yet known; therefore it shall be told. “Armageddon” signifies the love of honor, of rule, and of supereminence. This love is also signified by “Megiddo” in the old Hebrew tongue, as is evident from the meaning of that word in Arabic. Nor is anything else meant by “Armageddon” in the heavens; for all places mentioned in the Word signify things and states. [2] The love of honor, of rule, and of supereminence is the last state of the church, when falsities are about to fight against truths, because that love is about to rule in the church in its last times, and when that love rules, falsity from evil rules also, and this overcomes truth; for that love more than all other loves extinguishes the light of heaven and induces the darkness of hell, because that love is man’s very own; and by no force can man be drawn away from what is his own and raised up towards heaven so long as that love rules; and one’s own in which man is wholly immersed by that love is nothing but evil and falsity. That man from that love is in thick darkness as to all things of heaven and the church, consequently in mere falsities, does not appear to the man who is in it, because according to the brilliancy of the natural light (lumen) in them spiritual light (lux) is extinguished; but that brilliancy is from a delusive light (lumen), for it is a light kindled from the love of glory, thus from the love of self-intelligence; and when that intelligence is seen in heaven it is insanity and folly; therefore when that love rules in the church it is all over with it, for no one has any longer any understanding of truth or any will of good; since honor,"

This is true of all uses, civil, moral, or spiritual. It is otherwise when uses are made the end, and man does not attribute glory and honor to his own person, but to the uses themselves according to their excellence. Then honor, rule, and supereminence are the means, and are esteemed only to the extent that they serve uses as means. From all this it can in some measure be seen what “Armageddon” means. [3] Moreover, it has been shown me to the life that that love has devastated the church and adulterated all its goods and truths, not only in the kingdoms of Babylon but in all other kingdoms. For almost everyone at this day when he comes after death into the spiritual world carries with him out of the natural world the desire to be honored, to rule, and to be supereminent; and there are very few who love uses for the sake of uses, but it is their will that uses should serve, and that honor, which is not a use, should govern; and when that rules which when separated from use is nothing, there can be no lot or inheritance granted them in the heavens where uses alone rule, since the kingdom of the Lord is a kingdom of uses; and when these rule the Lord rules, since uses are goods, and all good is from the Lord.

The delights of varieties although with harlots are the delights of adultery, for the delight of variety destroys the delight of marriage. So, too, the delight of the defloration of virgins without the end of marriage is also the delight of adultery; for those who are in that delight afterwards desire marriage only for the sake of defloration, and when that is accomplished they loathe marriage. In a word, all whoredom that destroys the conjugial and extinguishes its love is adultery or pertains to adultery; while that which does not destroy the conjugial and does not extinguish its love is fornication springing from a certain instinct of nature towards marriage, which for various reasons cannot yet be entered into. 1011.

The “air” signifies thought because respiration, which is effected by means of the air, corresponds to thought, which is of the understanding, as the motion of the heart corresponds to affection, which is of the will. That the respiration of the lungs corresponds to thought is clearly evident from the fact that they operate simultaneously and harmoniously, for as man thinks so he breathes. If he thinks quietly he breathes quietly, and reversely if forcibly. If he thinks intensely and interiorly in himself, respiration is gradually arrested and withdrawn. Thus man varies the state of his respiration in accommodation to every state of his thought. The reason of this is that man has two lives, namely, the life of the understanding and the life of the will; and all things of the body correspond to these two lives of the mind. Thus in general the life of the respiration corre sponds to the life of the understanding and consequent thought; and the life of the motion of the heart corresponds to the life of the will and the consequent love. These two lives are meant by “soul” and “heart” in the Word, where it is said “with the whole soul and with the whole heart,” which signifies with the whole understanding and the whole will, or with every thought which is of faith and with every affection which is of love. This is said to make known that the “air,” since respiration is effected by it, signifies thought. [2] “The last vial was poured out into the air,” because all things of man close into his thoughts. For such as a man is as to the church and as to the goods and truths of the church, also as to love, in a word, such as he is as to his spiritual, moral, and civil life, such is he as to thought. This can be perceived especially in the spiritual world. When any angel goes out of his own society into a society not his own his breathing labors, because he is not thinking from a like affection. So, too, when an infernal spirit ascends into an angelic society he comes into distress of breathing, and thus into anguish, or into fantasy, or into blindness of thought; which makes clear that such as a man is such is his thought."

The nearest sense of this commandment, “Thou shalt not kill,” which is the spiritual moral sense, is that one must not hate his brother or neighbor, and thus not defame or slander him; for thus he would injure or kill his reputation and honor, which is the source of his life among his brethren, which is called his civil life, and afterwards he would live in society as one dead, for he would be numbered among the vile and wicked, with whom no one would associate. When this is done from enmity, from hatred, or from revenge, it is murder. Moreover, by many in the world this life is counted and esteemed in equal measure with the life of the body. And before the angels in the heavens he that destroys this life is held to be as guilty as if he had destroyed the bodily life of his brother. For enmity, hatred, and revenge breathe murder and will it; but they are restrained and curbed by fear of the law, of resistance, and of loss of reputation. And yet these three are endeavors towards murder; and every endeavor is like an act, for it goes forth into act when fear is removed. This is what the Lord teaches in Matthew: Ye have heard that it was said to them of old, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be liable to the judgment. But I say unto you, that whosoever is angry with his brother rashly shall be liable to the judgment; whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be liable to the council; but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be liable to the Gehenna of fire (5:21–26). This may be seen explained above (n. 693, 746f).

This is evident from the signification of “a great voice, saying,” as being manifestation; from the signification of “temple,” as being heaven as to the Divine truth, through which all manifestation is effected (see n. 220, 391c, e, 915); also from the signification of “throne,” as being where the Lord is as to judgment (see n. 253, 267, 462, 477); also from the signification of “It is done,” as being to be ended, that is, that there is no longer any good and truth, thus no longer any church, because all things are devastated. All this makes clear that “a great voice coming forth out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, It is done,” signifies manifestation out of heaven from the Lord that the end is come, and that the last judgment is at hand. This was said after “the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air,” which signifies that all things of man’s thought have been turned away from heaven, consequently there is no longer any communication of men of the church with heaven; and when this communication has been broken off the last judgment comes. For so long as there is a communication of heaven with the church all things are held together in connection; but when communication is destroyed it is like a house falling when the foundation is taken from under it. And yet a new house is then built by the Lord in its place; the house is the church."

It is the source of essential murder because man is man from the Lord through the reception of good and truth; consequently to destroy good and truth is to destroy the human itself, thus to kill man. [3] That those who are in hell are such has not yet been known in the world, because with those who belong to hell and therefore after death come into hell, there does not appear any hatred against good and truth, nor against heaven, nor still less against the Lord. For everyone while he lives in the world is in externals; and these externals are taught and trained from infancy to counterfeit such things as are honest and decorous, just and equitable, and good and true. Nevertheless, hatred lies concealed in their spirit, and this in equal degree with the evil of their life. And as hatred is in the spirit it breaks forth when the externals are laid aside, as is the case after death. [4] This infernal hatred against all who are in good is deadly hatred because it is hatred against the Lord. This can be seen particularly from their delight in doing evil, which is such as to exceed in degree every other delight, for it is a fire that burns with the lust for destroying souls. Moreover, it has been ascertained that this delight is not from hatred against those whom they attempt to destroy, but from hatred against the Lord Himself. Now since man is a man from the Lord, and the human which is from the Lord is good and truth, and since those who are in hell are, from a hatred against the Lord, eager to kill the human, which is good and truth, it follows that hell is the source of murder itself. 1014. Verse 18. And there were voices, lightnings, and thunders, signifies reasonings, darkenings of the understanding, and conclusions of falsities from evils.

This signification in the Word of “voices, lightnings, and thunders,” is derived from the appearance of these in the spiritual world with those who are not in the good of love and in the truths of faith, but who talk with each other about them. Their discourse, which is reasoning, is signified by “voices,” the conflict of truth and falsity by “lightnings,” and consequent rejection of truth and good by “thunders.” And as such things come forth in the spiritual world by correspondence, it follows that the like things in the natural world correspond, and thus have such signification as has been said. (Continuation respecting the Seventh Commandment) [2] From what has been said above it can be seen that all who are in evils as to life, and in the falsities therefrom, are murderers; for they are enemies and haters of good and truth, since evil hates good and falsity hates truth. The evil man does not know that he is in such hatred until he becomes a spirit; then hatred is the very delight of his life. Consequently from hell, where all the evil are, there constantly breathes forth the delight in doing evil from hatred; but from heaven, where all the good are, there constantly breathes forth the delight in doing good from love. Therefore two opposite spheres meet each other in the middle region between heaven and hell, and engage in reciprocal combat. While man lives in the world he is in this middle region. If he is then in evil and in falsities therefrom he passes over to the side of hell, and thus comes into the delight of doing evil from hatred. But if he is in good and in truths therefrom, he passes over to the side of heaven, and thus comes into the delight of doing good from love. [3] The delight of doing evil from hatred, which breathes forth from hell, is the delight in killing. But as they cannot kill the body they wish to kill the spirit; and to kill the spirit is to take away spiritual life, which is the life of heaven. This makes clear that the commandment, “Thou shalt not kill,” involves also “thou shalt not hate thy neighbor, also thou shalt not hate the good of the church and its truth\"; for if one hates good and truth he hates the neighbor; and to hate is to wish to kill.

This is evident from the signification of an “earthquake,” as being a change of the state of the church (see n. 400, 499); for the “earth” signifies the church, and its quaking signifies a change of state; and it was called “great” to signify that the state was wholly changed. (Continuation respecting the Seventh Commandment) [2] Since hatred, which is to will to kill, is the opposite of love to the Lord and also of love towards the neighbor, and since these loves are what make heaven with man, it is evident that hatred, being thus opposite, is what makes hell with him. Nor is infernal fire anything else than hatred; and in consequence the hells appear to be in a fire with a dusky glow according to the quality and quantity of the hatred, and in a fire with a dusky flame according to the quantity and quality of the revenge from hatred. [3] Since hatred and love are direct opposites, and since hatred in consequence constitutes hell with man, just as love constitutes heaven with him, therefore the Lord thus teaches: If thou shalt offer thy gift upon the altar, and shalt there remember that thy brother hath aught against thee, leave there thy gift before the altar, and go; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then coming, offer thy gift. Be well disposed towards thine adversary whiles thou art in the way with him; lest haply the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison. Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt not come out thence till thou hast paid the last farthing (Matt. 5:23–26). To be delivered to the judge, and by the judge to the officer, and by him to be cast into prison, describes the state of the man who is in hatred after death from his having been in hatred against his brother in the world, “prison” meaning hell, and “to pay the last farthing” signifies the punishment that is called everlasting fire."

This is evident from the signification of “there was not such an earthquake,” as being that the state of the church was more changed than heretofore, thus completely inverted; also from the signification of “the men that were upon the earth,” as being with those who are of the church, thus who are in the countries where the church is. Here the state of the church with the Reformed is especially treated of, while the church with the Babylonians will be treated of hereafter. And that the state of the church has been turned into its opposite is clear from this, that it is not known at this day what good is, nor what truth nor even what love is, nor what faith is; for love is called faith, works are called faith, good is called faith, truth is called faith, and yet it is not in the least seen whether the accepted faith, in which everything of the church is included, be a faith in truth, since it consists of mere incomprehensible things. (Continuation respecting the Seventh Commandment) [2] Since hatred is infernal fire it is clear that it must be removed before love, which is heavenly fire, can flow in, and by light from itself give life to man; and this infernal fire can in no wise be removed unless man knows whence hatred is and what it is, and afterwards turns away from it and shuns it. There is in every man by inheritance hatred against the neighbor; for every man is born into the love of self and of the world, and in consequence conceives hatred, and from it is inflamed against all who do not make one with him and favor his love, especially against those who oppose his lusts. For no one can love himself above all things and love the Lord at the same time; neither can anyone love the world above all things and love the neighbor at the same time; since no one can serve two masters at the same time without despising and hating the one while he honors and loves the other. Hatred is especially with those who are in the love of ruling over all; with others it is enmity. [3] It shall be told what hatred is. Hatred has in itself a fire which is an endeavor to kill man. That fire is manifested by anger. There"

Such an earthquake, so great, signifies that the church was no more. This is evident from what has been said thus far in this chapter about the church, and before about faith alone, which at this day constitutes the church. (Continuation respecting the Seventh Commandment) When a man abstains from hatred and turns away from it and shuns it as diabolical, then love, charity, mercy and clemency flow in through heaven from the Lord, and then first the works which he does are works of love and charity. The works he had done before, however good might be their appearance in the external form, were all works of the love of self and of the world, in which hatred lurked whenever they were not rewarded. So long as hatred is not put away so long man is merely natural; and the merely natural man remains in all his inherited evil, nor can he become spiritual before hatred, with its root, which is the love of ruling over all, is removed; for the fire of heaven, which is spiritual love, cannot flow in so long as the fire of hell, which is hatred, stands in the way and shuts it out. 1018.

And the great city was divided into three parts, signifies that all things of the doctrine of truth from the Word were dissipated. This is evident from the signification of “city” as being doctrine (see n. 223); and all things of doctrine from the Word are meant because it is called the “great city\"; all things of the doctrine of truth are meant because it is added that “the cities of the nations fell,” and this signifies all things of the doctrine of good; for doctrine treats both of truths, which are predicated of faith, and of goods, which are predicated of love; therefore it is said doctrine of truth and the doctrine of good. Also from the signification of “divided into three parts,” as meaning to be dissipated. “To be divided into three parts” means to be dissipated, because “three” signifies all, the whole, and fullness, and when these are divided there is a dissipation. (That “three” signifies all, the whole, and fullness, and is predicated of truths, see above n. 532.) “To be divided into three parts” has a like signification in Ezekiel (5:2.) (The Eighth Commandment) [2] The eighth commandment of the Decalog, “Thou shalt not bear false witness,” shall now be explained. “To bear false witness” signifies in the sense nearest to the letter to lie about the neighbor by accusing him falsely. But in the internal sense it signifies to call what is just unjust, and what is unjust just, and to confirm this by means of falsities; while in the inmost sense it signifies to falsify the truth and good of the Word, and on the other hand to prove a falsity of doctrine to be true by confirming it by means of fallacies, appearances, fabrications, knowledges falsely applied, sophistries and the like. The confirmations themselves and the consequent persuasions are false witnesses, for they are false testimonies. From this it can be seen that what is here meant is not only false witness before a judge, but even a judge himself who in perverting right makes what is just unjust, and what is unjust just, for he as well as the witness himself acts the part of a false witness. The same is true of every man who makes what is right to appear crooked, and what is crooked to appear right; likewise any ecclesiastical leader who"

In a word, every falsification of truth, spiritual, moral, and civil, which is done from an evil heart, is false witness. 1020. And the cities of the nations fell, signifies that all things of the doctrine of good from the Word were likewise dissipated. This is evident from the signification of a “city,” as being doctrine (as just above); so “cities” mean doctrinals, or all things of doctrine. Also from the signification of “nations,” as being those who are in the good of love, and in an abstract sense goods (see n. 175, 331, 625). Also from the signification of “falling,” as meaning to be dissipated, for when cities fall they perish, and when doctrine falls its truths are dissipated. (Continuation respecting the Eighth Commandment) [2] When a man abstains from false testimonies understood in a moral and spiritual sense, and shuns and turns away from them as sins, the love of truth and the love of justice flow in from the Lord through heaven. And when, in consequence the man loves truth and loves justice he loves the Lord, for the Lord is truth itself and justice itself. And when a man loves truth and justice it may be said that truth and justice love him, because the Lord loves him; and as a consequence his utterances become utterances of truth, and his works become works of justice. 1021. And great Babylon came into remembrance before God, signifies that thus far the church with the Reformed and its devastation has been treated of, and that what follows treats of the church with the Papists and its devastation. This is evident from the signification of “Babylon” as being the church with the Papists, since “Babylon” signifies the love of ruling over heaven and over the earth through the holy things of the church; and this love is dominant chiefly with the Papists. These words mean also that thus far the church with the Reformed and its devastation has been treated of, as is evident from what precedes and from what follows. In what precedes it has treated of the dragon and the two beasts, which describes the church with the Reformed, its devastation by “the seven angels pouring out the seven vials” (as can be seen from"

In what follows the church with the Papists is described in chapter 17 by “the harlot sitting upon the scarlet beast,” and its devastation in chapter 18. From this it is clear that “great Babylon came into remembrance before God” signifies that thus far it has treated of the church with the Reformed and its devastation, and what follows treats of the church with the Papists, and its devastation. (The Ninth Commandment) [2] The ninth commandment, “Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s house,” is now to be treated of. There are two loves from which all lusts spring and flow forth perpetually like streams from their fountains. These loves are called the love of the world and the love of self. Lust is love continually willing, for what a man loves, that he continually longs for. But lusts belong to the love of evil, while desires and affections belong to the love of good. Now because the love of the world and the love of self are the foundations of all lusts, and all evil lusts are forbidden in these last two commandments, it follows that the ninth commandment forbids the lusts that flow from the love of the world, and the tenth commandment the lusts that flow from the love of self. “Not to covet a neighbor’s house” means not to covet his goods, which in general are possessions and wealth, and not to appropriate them to oneself by evil arts. This lust belongs to the love of the world. 1022. To give unto her the cup of the wrath of His anger, signifies its devastation through direful falsities of evil. This is evident from the signification of a “cup,” as being falsity from hell, which is the falsity of evil (see n. 960a); and as it appears as if God were wrathful and angry on account of this it is called “the cup of the wrath of the anger of God,” “wrath” on account of the falsity, and “anger” on account of the evil. So “to give unto her that cup” signifies to devastate, for the falsity of evil from hell devastates the church as to all good and truth. That the church meant by “Babylon” has been thus devastated will be made evident from the two following chapters."

These signify in the Word such affections; but because coveting and desiring these affections means to will and eagerly desire to subject a man to one’s own authority or bidding, it follows that lusting after these affections means the lusts of the love of self, that is, of the love of ruling, for thus does one make the things belonging to a companion to be his own. [3] From this it can now be seen that the lust of the ninth commandment is the lust of the love of the world, and that the lusts of this commandment are lusts of the love of self. For, as has been said before, all lusts are of love, for it is love that covets; and as there are two evil loves to which all lusts have reference, namely, the love of the world and the love of self, it follows that the lust of the ninth commandment has reference to the love of the world, and the lust of this commandment to the love of self, especially to the love of ruling.

Verse 20. And every island fled, signifies that there was no longer any truth of faith. This is evident from the signification of “island,” as being the church as to the truths of the natural man, which are called factual truths also cognitions of truth and good (concerning which see above, n. 406); here it signifies the church as to the truths of faith, for the truths that are called the truths of faith are the truths of the natural man; and that there were no longer these is signified by “every island fled.” An “island” means the church as to the truths of faith, the reason is that an island is land encompassed by the sea, and “land” signifies the church, and “sea” the knowing faculty and knowing in general, which belong to the natural man. “Islands” signify also in the Word the churches with the Gentiles that possess nothing but appearances of truth, which are truths further removed from genuine truths. Islands have this signification because the islands of the sea were widely separated from the land of Canaan, which was the mainland, by which the church that was in genuine truths was signified. (The Commandments of the Decalog in general) [2] The commandments of the Decalog are called the ten words or ten commandments, because “ten” signifies all; consequently the ten words mean all things of the Word, and thus all things of the church in a summary. All things of the Word and all things of the church in a summary are meant, because there are in each commandment three interior senses, each sense for its own heaven, for there are three heavens. The first sense is the spiritual moral sense; this is for the first or lowest heaven; the second sense is the celestial spiritual sense, which is for the second or middle heaven; and the third sense is the Divine celestial, which is for the third or inmost heaven.

Divine truth is the Divine that is called the Holy Spirit, for it not only proceeds from the Lord but it also enlightens man and teaches him, as is said of the Holy Spirit. As the Word in its descent from the Lord has been accommodated to the three heavens, and the three heavens are joined together as inmosts are with ultimates through intermediates, so, too, are the three senses of the Word; which shows that the Word is given that by it there may be a conjunction of the heavens with each other, and also a conjunction of the heavens with the human race, for whom the sense of the letter is given, which is merely natural and thus the basis of the other three senses. That the ten commandments of the Decalog are all things of the Word in a summary can be seen only from the three senses of those commandments, which are as above stated. 1025. And the mountains were not found, signifies that there was no longer any good of love. This is evident from the signification of “mountains,” as being the church as to the good of love (see n. 405, 510, 850a). “Mountains” mean the church as to the good of love, because “land” signifies the church, and angels that are in love to the Lord have their land upon mountains in the spiritual world; so “mountains” signify the church as to the good of love to the Lord. Such dwell upon mountains in the spiritual world because they are interior angels, and interior things in the spiritual world correspond to higher things, and actually become the higher. And this is why the Lord, because He is in the inmost, is called “the Most High,” and is said “to dwell in the highest.\" (Continuation: The Commandments in general) [2] What these three senses in the commandments of the Decalog are can be seen from the following summary explanation.

In the celestial spiritual sense it involves that one God only is to be acknowledged, and not several according to their qualities, as the ancients did, and as some pagans do at this day, or according to their works, as Christians do at this day, who make one God from creation, another from redemption, and another from enlightenment. [3] This commandment in the Divine celestial sense involves that the Lord alone is to be acknowledged and worshiped, and a trinity in Him, namely, the Divine Itself from eternity, which is meant by the Father, the Divine Human born in time, which is meant by the Son of God, and the Divine that proceeds from both, which is meant by the Holy Spirit. These are the three senses of the first commandment in their order. From this commandment viewed in its threefold sense it is clear that it contains and includes in a summary all things that concern the Divine as to essence. [4] The second commandment, “Thou shalt not profane the name of God,” contains and includes in its three senses all things that concern the quality of the Divine, since “the name of God” signifies His quality, which in its first sense is the Word, doctrine from the Word, and worship of the lips and of the life from doctrine; in its second sense it means the Lord’s kingdom on the earth and the Lord’s kingdom in the heavens; and in its third sense it means the Lord’s Divine Human, for this is the quality of the Divine Itself. (That the Lord’s Divine Human is “the name of God” in the highest sense may be seen above, n. 224.) In the other commandments there are likewise three internal senses for the three heavens; but these, the Lord willing, will be considered elsewhere. 1026. Verse 21. And a great hail, as of the weight of a talent, cometh down from heaven upon men, signifies falsities in the greatest degree infernal destroying all the understanding of truth with the men of the church.

The quality of the falsities is compared to a talent, because a talent was the largest denomination in the reckoning of money and the weighing of silver, and “silver” signifies truth, and in the contrary sense falsity, and “weight” signifies what is heavy from evil, thus in the greatest degree infernal; for falsity from evil is heavy and falls of itself into hell. Also from the signification of “coming down from heaven upon men,” as being from hell destroying the understanding of truth with the men of the church; for by “men” men of the church as to the understanding of truth are meant, or what is the same, such understanding of truth as the men of the church possess. [2] “Coming down from heaven” signifies to be from hell, because falsity, which is here signified by a “great hail,” does not come down from heaven, but rises up from hell. Hail indeed falls from heaven in the spiritual world as in the natural world, since hail is rain that descends from heaven; but it is frozen into hail by the cold that rises up from hell, and that cold is the absence of heat or of heavenly love. From this it follows that hail does not come down as hail from heaven, but is from hell. It is the same with the rain of brimstone and fire from heaven. “Rain” of water signifies the Divine truth from heaven, but “hail” Divine truth changed into infernal falsity, which is done while it is coming down from heaven. (Continuation: The Commandments in general) [3] As Divine truth united to Divine good proceeds from the Lord as a sun, and by this, heaven and the world were made (John 1:1, 3, 10), it follows that it is from this that all things in heaven and in the world have reference to good and to truth and to their conjunction that they may be anything. These ten commandments contain all things of Divine good and all things of Divine truth, and there is also in them a conjunction of these. But this conjunction is hidden; for it is like the conjunction of love to the Lord and love towards the neighbor; Divine good belongs to love to the Lord, and Divine truth to love towards the neighbor; for when a man lives according to Divine truth, that is, loves his neighbor, the Lord flows in with Divine good and conjoins Himself. For this reason there were two tables on which these ten commandments were written, and they were called a covenant,"

Upon one table the commandments of love to the Lord were written, and upon the other table the commandments of love towards the neighbor. The commandments of love to the Lord are the first three, and the commandments of love towards the neighbor are the last six; and the fourth commandment, which is “Honor thy father and thy mother,” is the mediating commandment, for in it “father” means the Father in the heavens, and “mother” means the church, which is the neighbor. 1027. And men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail, signifies consequent falsification of the Word. This is evident from the signification of “blaspheming God,” as being to falsify the Word (see above, n. 778, 991); also from the signification of “the plague of the hail,” as being falsity in the greatest degree infernal (see just above), from which comes the falsification of the Word. (Continuation: The Commandments in general) [2] Something shall now be said about how conjunction is effected by means of the commandments of the Decalog. Man does not conjoin himself to the Lord, but the Lord alone conjoins man to Himself, and this He does by man’s knowing, understanding, willing, and doing these commandments; and when man does them there is conjunction, but if he does not do them he ceases to will them, and when he ceases to will them he ceases also to understand and know them. For what does willing amount to if man when he is able does not do? Is it not a figment of reason? From this it follows that conjunction is effected when a man does the commandments of the Decalog. [3] But it has been said that man does not conjoin himself to the Lord, but that the Lord alone conjoins man to Himself, and that conjunction is effected by doing; and from this it follows that it is the Lord with man that does these commandments. But anyone can see that a covenant cannot be entered into and conjunction be effected by it unless there is some reciprocal on man’s part, not"

To this end the Lord has imparted to man a freedom to will and act as if of himself, and such a freedom that man does not know otherwise, when he is thinking truth and doing good, than that the freedom is in himself and thus from himself. This reciprocal is on man’s part in order that conjunction may be effected. But as this freedom is from the Lord, and continually from Him, man must by all means acknowledge that to think and understand truth and to will and do good are not from himself, but are from the Lord, according to what has been said on this subject above (n. 946, 971, 973). [4] Consequently when man through the last six commandments conjoins himself to the Lord as if of himself, the Lord then conjoins Himself to man through the first three commandments, which are that man must acknowledge God, must believe in the Lord, and must keep His name holy. This man does not believe, however much he may think that he does, unless the evils forbidden in the other table, that is, in the last six commandments, he abstains from as sins. These are the things pertaining to the covenant on the part of the Lord and on the part of man, through which there is reciprocal conjunction, which is that man may be in the Lord and the Lord in man (John 14:20). 1028. For the plague thereof was exceeding great, signifies the total destruction of genuine truth. This is evident from the signification of “the plague of the hail,” as being the falsification of the Word (as above); therefore “the plague thereof was exceeding great” signifies more grievous falsification, which is that the Word is falsified even to the destruction of all genuine truth. How the Word is falsified even to the destruction of genuine truth, and heaven is thereby closed against man, may be seen above (n. 719, 778, 888, 914, 916, 950). (Continuation: The Commandments in general) [2] It is said by some that he who sins against one commandment of the Decalog sins also against the rest, thus that he who is guilty of one is guilty of all. It shall be told how far this is in harmony with the truth. When a man transgresses one commandment by"

[3] For example, when one does not regard frauds and illicit gains, which in themselves are thefts, as sins, neither does he regard as a sin adultery with the wife of another, hating a man even to murder, lying about him, coveting his house and other things belonging to him; for when he rejects from his heart in any one commandment the fear of God he denies that anything is a sin; consequently he is in communion with those who in like manner transgress the other commandments. He is like an infernal spirit who is in a hell of thieves; and although he is not an adulterer, nor a murderer, nor a false witness, yet he is in communion with such, and can be persuaded by them to believe that such things are not evils, and can be led to do them. For he who has become an infernal spirit through the transgression of one commandment, no longer believes it to be a sin to do anything against God or anything against the neighbor. [4] But the opposite is true of those who abstain from the evil forbidden in one commandment, and who shun and afterwards turn away from it as a sin against God. Because such fear God, they come into communion with the angels of heaven, and are led by the Lord to abstain from the evils forbidden in the other commandments and to shun them, and finally to turn away from them as sins; and if perchance they have sinned against them, yet they repent and thus by degrees are withdrawn from them."

In a few passages in his Last Judgment (1758) as well as here in the Apocalypse Explained and in his Spiritual Diary (both posthumous works) Swedenborg seemed to equate second resurrection (resurrection secunda) with second death (mors secunda), although this latter term does not appear in the Bible. However, when he published Apocalypse Revealed (1766) he stated decisively at n. 851 that “there is only one resurrection to life, a second is not given; therefore a second resurrection is nowhere mentioned.” 15. The context here suggests that “not” was omitted in the Latin text. 16. The Latin text has “head” (capite) instead of “branches” (ramis); see Isaiah 17:6, cited above. 17. The Hebrew has “days upon a year.” Schmidt’s Latin Bible (1696), which Swedenborg apparently followed here, has “year upon year.” 18. See note 17, above. 19.

In the explanation that follows he wrote “great” where the word “evil” is quoted. In the Apocalypse Revealed, when dealing with this same text, Swedenborg rendered it “evil” consistently."
