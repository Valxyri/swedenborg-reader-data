      "text": "APOCALYPSE EXPLAINED 1 Editor’s Preface Apocalypse Explained is the most extensive posthumous work of Emanuel Swedenborg, filling five and a half volumes in this Standard Edition. The first draft of the unfinished work, treating the book of Revelation, chapters 1–19:10, and a brief memorandum on chapter 20, was probably begun in 1757. Although never published by the author, his intent to do so is obvious, as he prepared a fair copy for the printer. On the title page is written “London, 1759.” It contains text paragraphs 1–1229, abruptly breaking off in the middle of an explanation of verse 10 of chapter 19 of Revelation. (It was not until 1766 that Swedenborg published Apocalypse Revealed, his fully rewritten and complete work on the book of Revelation.) Apocalypse Explained was first published in the original Latin in four volumes (1785–1789). However, the editors of that edition decided to add from the published work Apocalypse Revealed the missing portion—namely, Swedenborg’s explication of the last three and a half chapters of the book of Revelation— giving the confusing impression that Apocalypse Explained was a completed work. A first scholarly Latin-English edition of the work was published in twelve volumes (1889–1897) by the American Swedenborg Printing and Publishing Society (the former name of the Swedenborg Foundation). This present edition of Apocalypse Explained was translated from the Latin by John C. Ager and revised by John Whitehead. The text for this edition was electronically scanned from the Foundation’s Standard Edition. This process has allowed the books to be completely redesigned and set in a new and more readable typeface. Certain stylistic changes have also been introduced. These include modernized spelling and punctuation as well as the substitution of new words for terms whose meanings have become obscure or have changed since the nineteenth century. Arabic numerals have replaced roman numerals in Bible passages, and certain capitalized words, including pronouns referring to God,"

All these changes have been carefully made in order to make the book easier to read and use while preserving the dignity and power of the original Latin. On the whole, however, the Ager-Whitehead translation has not been materially altered. A word needs to be said about the translation of the Scripture passages in this work, some of which Swedenborg translated from biblical Hebrew and Greek, others he cited from Latin Bibles in his personal library. The reader will note that the archaic language of the 1611 King James Bible, commonly called the Authorized Version, has been retained in the Scripture citations in this edition. Thus verbs will often have the suffix “-eth,” and pronoun forms such as “thee,” “thou,” and “thine” are retained. This custom, based on the almost universal use of the King James version at that time, dates back to the earliest English translations of Swedenborg. The decision was made by the early translators to follow the familiar language of that Bible wherever it did not conflict with the Latin of Swedenborg’s Scripture citations. Although it was clear to the editor of this edition and his consultants that it would be highly desirable to update this language, these citations appear so frequently that changing them throughout the entire work would have required a major revision. Volume 1 of Apocalypse Explained begins Swedenborg’s verse-by- verse exposition, or commentary, of the biblical text of the Apocalypse, commonly known as Revelation or the Revelation of John. This volume covers chapters 1 through 4. As was the custom in his day, Swedenborg referred to the Psalms as the book of David, and to the Pentateuch (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy) as the books of Moses. As with previous printings, the bold numerals in brackets, [2], [3], etc., indicate divisions of Swedenborg’s longer numbered sections that were added for the convenience of the reader by John Faulkner Potts in his six-volume Swedenborg Concordance (London: Swedenborg Society, 1888–1902). The numbers in parentheses (6), (7), etc., are divisions of the exposition by the author. Italicized letters following a number (518a, 518b) are subdivisions added by the Latin editor, Samuel H. Worcester. Words or phrases in brackets are also editorial insertions into Swedenborg’s text."

Many have expounded this prophetical book called Revelation, but none of them understood the internal or spiritual sense of the Word. They have therefore applied the particular things in the book to the successive states of the church, which they have learned from histories; many things, moreover, they have applied to civil affairs. For this reason those expositions are for the most part conjectures, which can never appear in such light that they can be affirmed as truths. As soon, therefore, as they are read, they are put aside as speculations. The expositions of Revelation now extant are of this character, because, as has been said, their authors had no"

Yet, in fact, all things recorded in Revelation are written in a style similar to that of the Old Testament prophecies, and to the style, in general in which everything in the Word is written. The Word in the letter is natural, but in its bosom it is spiritual; and being such, it contains within it a sense that is not at all apparent in the letter. How the one sense differs from the other may be seen from what is said and shown in White Horse and in the appendix there from Arcana Coelestia. 2. From this it is evident that Revelation, equally with the Old Testament prophecies, can in no wise be understood, nor can anything therein be understood, unless the spiritual sense be known, and furthermore unless there be revelation from heaven, where the whole Word is understood according to that sense. That this is so the exposition itself that follows will establish. 3. In the following exposition many passages are cited from Arcana Coelestia; be it known, therefore, that they are from that work.

Verse 1. The revelation of Jesus Christ signifies predictions from the Lord respecting the last times of the church. This is evident from the signification of “revelation,” as being predictions; and since these are from the Lord alone, it is said, “the revelation of Jesus Christ.” The revelation, or predictions, are respecting the last times of the church, since those times are especially treated of. It may be supposed that in Revelation the successive states of the church from beginning to end are treated of; these, however, are not there treated of, but only the state of heaven and of the church near the end, when the last judgment takes place, thus the last times. The successive states of the church were foretold by the Lord himself in Matthew 24, 25; and also in Mark 13; yet what is there given is written in the Divine prophetic style, that is, by means of correspondences; consequently it is of such a character that it can only be revealed and made evident by the internal or spiritual sense. (It has therefore been granted me from the Lord to unfold these things in Arcana Coelestia, at the beginning of chapters 26 to 40 of Genesis; which explanations may be seen in their order, in the following places: n. 3353–3356, 3486–3489, 3650–3655, 3751–3757, 3897–3901, 4056–4060, 4229–4231, 4332–4335, 4422–4424, 4635–4638, 4661–4664, 4807–4810, 4954–4959, 5063–5071.) 6.

Such are meant by servants of God, because those who hearken to and obey God are called, in the Word, servants of God. Hearkening and obedience take place with those who are in truths from good, but not with those who are in truths alone, or in truths without good; for these have truths in the memory only, and not in the life; whereas those who are in truths from good have truths in the life, and those who have truths in the life do them from the heart, that is, from love. Be it known, that no truth ever enters into the life of man unless the man be in good, for good is of love, and love makes the whole man; man therefore receives into his life all truths that are in accord. This may be abundantly seen from the fact, that whatever a man loves he appropriates to himself; and everything else he casts from him, yea, holds it in aversion. By good is here meant the good of love to the Lord and the good of love towards the neighbor; for this good is the only spiritual good, and with this truths of faith are in accord. 7. Things which must quickly come to pass signifies which will certainly be. This is evident from the signification of “things which must come to pass,” as being things that must needs be; and from the signification of “quickly,” as meaning what is certain and full (Arcana Coelestia, n. 5284, 6783). Those who look at all things in the Word according to the sense of the letter do not know otherwise than that “quickly” signifies quickly; thus here, that the things predicted in Revelation were to occur quickly; from which they are led to wonder that nevertheless so long a time has elapsed before the last judgment took place. But those who know the internal sense of the Word, do not understand “quickly,” but certainly. They see that “quickly” means certainly, because quickly involves time, and time is proper to nature; thus quickly is a natural, not a spiritual expression; and in the Word, all natural expressions signify the spiritual things that correspond to them; for the Word in its bosom is spiritual, while in the letter it is natural.

And signified, sending by his angel, to his servant John signifies which are revealed out of heaven to those who are in the good of love. This is evident from the signification of “signified,” as being the things in the sense of the letter that contain and thus signify those that are in the internal sense; for it is said, “the revelation which God gave to show, and signified”; and by the things that he signified are meant those that are in the sense of the letter, because all these signify, while the things that are signified are those that are contained in the internal sense. For all things in the Word are significative of spiritual things, which are in the internal sense. This is also evident from the signification of “sending by his angel,” as meaning, which are revealed out of heaven; for “to send” is to reveal, and “by an angel” is out of heaven. “To send” is to reveal, because everything that is sent out of heaven is revelation; for that which is there is what is revealed; and this is the spiritual which relates to the church and its state; but with man this is changed into the natural, such as is expressed in the sense of the letter in Revelation and elsewhere in the Word. That which comes out of heaven can be presented to man in no other way; for the spiritual falls into its corresponding natural when it descends out of the spiritual world into the natural. This is why the prophetic Word in the sense of the letter is such as it is, and being such, is in its bosom spiritual and is Divine. By “angel” is meant “out of heaven,” because that which an angel speaks is out of heaven; for when an angel communicates to man such things as pertain to heaven and the church, he does not speak as man speaks with man, who brings forth out of his memory what another has told him; but that which an angel speaks flows in continuously, not into his memory, but immediately into his understanding, and from that into words. From this it is that all things that the angels spoke to the prophets are Divine, and nothing at all from the angels. Whether it be said, that these revelations are out of heaven, or are from the Lord, it is the same; because the Divine of the Lord with the angels constitutes heaven, and nothing whatever from the angels’ proprium [selfhood, or what is their own].

[2] The things revealed out of heaven are said to be for those who are in the good of love, because it is said, “sending by his angel to his servant John,” and by “John” those who are in the good of love are represented and meant. For by the twelve apostles are represented and signified all in the church who are in truths from good; consequently, all truths from good, from which is the church; and by each of the apostles in particular something special; thus by “Peter” faith; by “James” charity; and by “John” the good of charity or the good of love. Because John represented this good, the revelation was made to him; for revelation out of heaven, such as this, can be made only to those who are in the good of charity or of love. Others, indeed, can hear the things that are from heaven, but they cannot perceive them. Only those who are in the good of love have spiritual perception. This is because they receive heavenly things not only with the hearing, but also with the love; and to receive with the love is to receive fully, since the things so received are loved; moreover, those who thus receive, see these things in their understanding, where the sensation of their internal sight is. That this is so has been proven to me by much experience. It might also be elucidated by much rational argument; but the subject cannot just now be amplified so far. It is here only necessary to say, that all names mentioned in the Word signify not persons but things; that “John,” for instance signifies such as are in the good of love, thus in the abstract the good of love itself. (That all names in the Word signify things may be seen in Arcana Coelestia, n. 768, 1888, 4310, 4442, 10329. That the names of persons and places in the Word cannot enter heaven, but that they are changed into the things that they signify, n. 1876, 5225, 6516, 10216, 10282, 10432.

When one knows that all names in the Word signify things, and that the names of the twelve sons of Jacob, or of the twelve tribes signify all truths and goods of the church in the complex; and in like manner, the names of the twelve disciples of the Lord; and that “Peter,” “James,” and “John” signify faith, charity, and the good of charity; he can see many arcana in the Word; as for example, why: The Lord gave the name Peter to Simon, and to James and John the name Boanerges, which means sons of thunder (Mark 3:16–17). For “Peter,” like petra [rock] signifies the Lord as to truth from good, or faith from charity; and “sons of thunder” signify those who from affection, which is of love, receive the truths of heaven. (That “rock” signifies the Lord in respect to truth from good, or faith from charity, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 8581, 10580; in like manner the “stone of Israel,” n. 6426; and that “thunders” signify Divine truths from heaven, n. 7573, 8914; and “lightning” the splendors thereof, n. 8813; whence thunders were also called “voices,” n. 7573, 8914.) [2] I will here mention some arcana that may be seen by those who are aware that “Peter” signifies faith, and “John” the good of charity. First, why the Lord said to Peter: I also say unto thee, Thou art Peter, and upon this rock will I build my church; and I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of the heavens (Matt. 16:18–19). It appears from the letter, as if that power was given to Peter, when in fact no power was given to Peter; but it was so said to him because “Peter” signified truth from good, which is from the Lord; and truth from good, which is from the Lord, has all power, thus the Lord has all power from good through truth.

By these words is signified, that in the last time of the church there would be no faith in the Lord, because no charity; for “cock- crowing,” as well as “twilight” signifies the last time of the church (n. 10134); and “three” or “thrice” signifies what is complete to the end (n. 2788, 4495, 5159, 9198, 10127. That the end of the church is when there is no faith, because no charity, see Last Judgment, n. 33–39 seq.). [3] A third arcanum that may be seen is what is signified by the following words concerning Peter and John: Jesus saith to Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord, thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs. He saith to him again a second time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord, thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Tend my sheep. He saith unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he saith unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep. Verily, verily, I say unto thee, when thou wast younger, thou girdest thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest; but when thou shall be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and bear thee whither thou wouldest not. And when he had thus spoken, he saith unto him, Follow me. Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved, following, and he saith, Lord, What shall this one [do]? Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? Follow thou me (John 21:15–22). What these things signify no one can know unless he knows the internal sense, and knows that “Peter” signifies faith, and “John” the good of charity, thus that “Peter” signifies those in the church who are in faith, and “John” those who are in the good of charity.

(That “lambs” signify those who are in the good of innocence and of love to the Lord, may be seen in Arcana Coelestia, n. 3994, 10132; that “sheep” signify those who are in the good of charity towards the neighbor, n. 4169, 4809; and that “to feed” is to instruct, n. 5201, 6078.) [4] Faith, as it was to be in the first period of the church and as it was to be in the last is then described by the Lord. The first period of the church is meant by “when thou wast younger,” and its last by “when thou shalt be old.” That when Peter “was younger he girded himself and walked whither he would” signifies that in the first period of the church men would imbibe truths from the good of charity and would act from freedom; for to act from freedom is to act from the affection of truth from good. “When thou shalt be old thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee and lead thee whither thou wouldest not” signifies that in the last period of the church they would no longer imbibe truths from the good of charity, thus would not know them in any other way than as declared by another; and thus would be in a servile state; for a servile state ensues when good does not lead. (That “garments” signify truths, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 1073, 2576, 5319, 5954, 9212, 9216, 9952, 10536; and that therefore to “gird oneself” denotes to imbibe and perceive truths, n. 9952.

But Jesus said to him, “If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? Follow thou me.” By this is signified that the good of charity will follow the Lord, and will acknowledge him, even to the last period of the old church, and the first of the new. (That the last period of the old church is called “the consummation of the age,” and the beginning of the new church “the coming of the Lord,” see Arcana Coelestia, n. 4535, 10622.) A fourth arcanum that may be seen is, why the Lord loved John above the rest of the disciples, and consequently why John lay on the breast or in the bosom of the Lord (John 13:23; 21:20); namely, because the good of love was what the Lord saw when he beheld John, who represented and signified that good; since it is that good that constitutes heaven and the church (see Heaven and Hell, n. 13–19). A fifth arcanum is manifest when it is known that John represented the good of love, namely, what is signified by the words of the Lord from the cross to the mother Mary and to John: When Jesus therefore seeth his mother, and the disciple standing by whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son. Then he saith to the disciple, Behold thy mother. And from that hour the disciple took her unto his own home (John 19:26, 27). By “mother” and by “woman” is here meant the church, and by “John” the good of charity; and by the things here said, that the church will be where the good of charity is. (That by “woman,” in the Word, is meant the church, may be seen in Arcana Coelestia, n. 252–253, 749, 770, 3160, 6014, 7337, 8994; that the like is signified by “mother,” n. 289, 2691, 2717, 3703, 4257, 5581, 8897, 10490. That to “take her unto his own home” is that these should dwell together is evident.) From this it can now be seen how great arcana lie concealed in the Word, which are laid open to those"

Apart from that sense it cannot be known, moreover, what is signified when it is said: That the apostles shall sit upon twelve thrones, and shall judge the twelve tribes of Israel (Matt. 19:28; Luke 22:30). By “apostles” here are meant not apostles, but all truths from good, which are from the Lord; thus by these words is signified that the Lord alone will judge all from truths that are from good, thus that everyone will be judged according to those truths. 10. Verse 2. Who bare witness to the Word of God, and to the testimony of Jesus Christ signifies to those who in heart acknowledge Divine truth, and the Divine of the Lord in his human. This is evident from the signification of “bearing witness,” as meaning to acknowledge in heart (of which hereafter), and from the signification of “the Word,” or speech of God, as meaning Divine truth (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 4692, 5075, 9987); and from the signification of [the testimony of] “Jesus Christ,” as meaning the acknowledgment of the Lord’s Divine in his human. This is signified by “the testimony of Jesus Christ,” because “to testify” signifies to acknowledge in heart, and to acknowledge Jesus Christ in heart is to acknowledge the Divine in his human; for he that acknowledges the Lord, and does not at the same time acknowledge the Divine in his human, does not acknowledge the Lord; since his Divine is in his human, and not out of it; for the Divine is in its human as the soul is in the body, consequently to think of the Lord’s human, and not at the same time of his Divine is like thinking of a man abstractly from his soul or life, which is not thinking of a man. [2] That the Lord’s Divine is in his human, and that together they are one person, the doctrine received throughout the Christian world teaches; which teaching is as follows: “Although Christ is God and man, yet they are not two, but one Christ; one, but not by a change of the Divine into the human, but the Divine took the human to itself. Altogether one, not by confusion of the two natures, but by unity of person; for as soul and body make one man, so God and man are one Christ” (Athanasian Creed). From"

Therefore those that think otherwise do not think of the Lord; and those that do not think of the Lord in that way are unable to think of the Divine that is called the Father’s, for the Lord saith: I am the way, the truth, and the life; no one cometh unto the Father but through me (John 14:6). Since this acknowledgment is signified by the “testimony of Jesus Christ,” it is said that: The testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy (Rev. 19:10). “The spirit of prophecy” is the life and soul of doctrine (that “spirit” in the internal sense of the Word signifies life or soul, may be seen in Arcana Coelestia, n. 5222, 9281, 9818; and that “prophecy” signifies doctrine, n. 2534, 7269); and the acknowledgment of the Lord is the very life or soul of all doctrine in the church. But of this more will be said in what follows. [3] To “bear witness” is to acknowledge in heart, because spiritual things are treated of; and no one can bear witness respecting spiritual things except from the heart, because from no other source does he perceive that they are so. To bear witness of things that have existence in the world is to bear witness from knowledge, or from memory and thought, because the man has so seen or heard; but it is otherwise with things spiritual, for these fill the whole life and constitute it. The spirit of man, in which his life primarily resides, is nothing else than his will or his love, and his understanding and faith therefrom, and “heart” in the Word signifies the will and love, and understanding and faith therefrom. From this it is evident whence it is that by “bearing witness” in the spiritual sense is meant to acknowledge in heart. Since by the “heart” is signified the good of love, and this alone is what"

Whatsoever things he saw signifies their understanding enlightened. This is evident from the signification of “seeing,” as being to understand (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 2150, 2325, 2807, 3764, 3863, 3869, 4403–4421, 10705); here, to understand from enlightenment, because the things of the church and of heaven are treated of, which are not understood and perceived except from enlightenment; for things of the church and of heaven, which are called spiritual things, do not enter into man’s understanding, except by means of the light of heaven, and the light of heaven enlightens the understanding. For this reason the Word, in which are contained the things of the church and of heaven, cannot be understood except by one who is enlightened, and those only are enlightened who are in the affection of truth from good, thus who are in love to the Lord and in charity towards the neighbor. This good is spiritual good, with which and from which is the light of heaven, which enlightens. 12. Verse 3. Blessed signifies those in whom is heaven. This is evident from the signification of “the blessed,” as meaning those who are happy to eternity, thus in whom is heaven. Blessedness that is not eternal is indeed called blessedness, yet comparatively it is not, for it passes away, and that which passes away, in comparison with that which does not pass away, is as nothing. It is said, “in whom is heaven,” because heaven is in man; the heaven that is outside of man flows into the heaven that is within him, and is received so far as there is correspondence.

This is evident from the signification of “reading” the Word, as being to understand from enlightenment, thus to perceive, since to “read” signifies the like as to “see,” because he who reads, sees, and to “see” signifies to perceive from enlightenment, as was shown just above (n. 11). 14. And they that hear the words of the prophecy signifies that they live according to the doctrine of heaven. This is evident from the signification of “hearing,” as being to perceive and obey (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 2542, 3869, 4653, 5017, 7216, 8361, 8990, 9311, 9397, 10061); thus also to live according to that doctrine; for those who perceive and obey the doctrine of heaven live according to it; and from the signification of “the words of the prophecy,” as being the truths that pertain to the doctrine of heaven; for “words” are truths (n. 4692, 5075); and “prophecy” is doctrine (n. 2534, 7269); here it is the doctrine of heaven, since it is prophecy belonging to the Word, and the Word is from heaven. To “hear” is to obey and to live, because with celestial angels the things that are heard enter into the life; but as this is a thing unknown, I would like to explain it briefly. There are two senses given to man which serve as means of receiving the things whereby the rational is formed, and also the things by which man is reformed; these are the sense of sight and the sense of hearing; the other senses are for other uses. The things that enter by the sense of sight enter into man’s understanding and enlighten it, for which reason by “sight” is signified the understanding enlightened, for the understanding corresponds to the sight of the eye, as the light of heaven corresponds to the light of the world. The things, however, that enter by the sense of hearing enter both into the understanding and into the will, and"

Consequently, in human language, to “hear” anyone, and to “give ear to” anyone, also to “listen to,” and “hearken to,” are common expressions; and by “hearing anyone” is meant to perceive, and by “giving ear to,” as also by “listening to” is meant to obey; while “hearkening to” means either perceiving or obeying. These expressions flowed down into human language out of the spiritual world, where man’s spirit is. Their origin in the spiritual world shall also be explained. [2] Those there who are in the province of the ear are obediences from perception. (That all who are in the spiritual world are in some province that is named from the members, organs, or viscera of man, because they correspond thereto, may be seen in Heaven and Hell, n. 87–102.) Moreover, the province of the ear is in the axis of heaven; into it, therefore, or into those who are there, the whole spiritual world flows in, with the perception that “thus must it be done”; for this is the reigning perception in heaven; from this it is that those who are in that province are obediences from perception. That the things that enter by hearing enter immediately through the understanding into the will, may be further illustrated by the way in which angels of the celestial kingdom, who are most wise, are instructed. These angels receive all their wisdom by hearing, and not by sight; for whatsoever they hear about Divine things, they receive in the will from veneration and love, and make it of their life; and because they receive these things not first in the memory, but immediately in the life, they do not speak about matters of faith, but when these are mentioned by others, they answer, “Yea, yea,” or “Nay, nay,” according to the Lord’s words in Matthew 5:37. From this it is evident that hearing is given to man chiefly for the reception of wisdom, and sight for the reception of intelligence. Wisdom is to perceive, to will, and to do; and intelligence is to know and to perceive. (That the celestial angels imbibe wisdom by hearing, not by sight, may be seen in Heaven and Hell, n. 270, 271; and more concerning those angels, n. 20–28.)"

This is evident from the signification of “observing” and “keeping,” as being to perceive, to will, and to do according thereto, here according to the doctrine of heaven; and from the signification of “the things which are written therein,” as being, from the love of truth, or from the delight of that love; for what is done from love is done from delight; delight is from no other source. This is signified by “the things which are written therein,” because the things contained in the doctrine of heaven are written on the heart, and thus on the life, of those here described; and things written on the heart and life are written on the love; for “heart” in the Word signifies love (Arcana Coelestia, n. 7542, 9050, 10336). The love of truth is meant, because these things are said of the doctrine of heaven, and the doctrine of heaven is from truths. In the Word frequent mention is made of observing and keeping the precepts, the commandments, the words, and the law; and by observing and keeping is there signified to understand, to will, and to do, as in Matthew: Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I commanded you (Matt. 28:20); in Luke: Blessed are they that hear the Word of God and keep it (Luke 11:28); in John: Verily, verily, I say unto you, if anyone keep my word he shall never see death (John 8:51); If anyone love me he will keep my word: he that loveth me not, keepeth not my words (John 14:15, 23–24); If ye keep my commandments ye shall abide in my love.

This is evident from the signification of “time,” as meaning state (see Heaven and Hell, n. 162–169, where time in heaven is treated of); and from the signification of “near,” as being the internal; thus here, because it refers to state, the interior state such as is described above is meant. By state is meant a state of affection and of thought therefrom. He who reads this, and knows nothing of the internal sense, supposes that by “the time being near” is meant that the time was near when the things contained in Revelation would be fulfilled. But that this is not meant can be seen from the fact that seventeen centuries elapsed before they were fulfilled. But because the Word in the letter is natural and within is spiritual, it is said that “the time is near,” in order that in heaven the interior state might be understood; for if the expression “the interior state,” which is the spiritual sense, had here been used, it would not have been understood by the angels; for they perceive all things of the Word according to correspondences. “Near” signifies interior, because distances in heaven are entirely in accord with the differences of the good of love; for which reason those who are in kindred good are also near one another; and it is from this that on earth kinships are called near relationships [propinquitates], because they relate to spiritual affinities, which in heaven are really such. In heaven this is so because the good of love conjoins, and the more interior the good, the nearer is the conjunction. From this it is, that heaven is nearer to man, the more interiorly he is in the good of love; and the origin of this is that the Lord is nearer to an angel, to a spirit, and to man, the more interiorly they love him. To love him interiorly is to love his precepts interiorly; that is, to perceive, to will, and to do them from the delight of love. It is from this that “nearness,” in the Word signifies presence and conjunction (as may be seen in Arcana Coelestia, n. 5911, 9378, 9997, 10001). This nearness is thus described in John:"

These approximate or general explanations of the preceding words, not being presented in a continuous series, will appear disconnected; and this must be the case when each word or phrase is expounded separately, and the internal sense is immediately joined to the literal sense, which is diverse from it, and each is viewed by itself. But nevertheless, with angels, who are in the internal sense, this is not so. They do not see the sense of the letter, nor do they know anything about it; they see only the internal sense; and because they see this in the light of heaven, they see it in such a series and connection, and also in such abundance and thence in such wisdom, as cannot be expressed and described in human words.

Verse 4. John signifies the Lord in respect to doctrine. This is evident from the representation of “John,” as being the good of love (of which above, n. 8). Because he represents the good of love, he also in the highest sense represents the Lord, since all the good of love is from the Lord. Man, spirit, and angel, are only recipients, and they who are recipients are said to signify that which is from the Lord. It is similar with many others in the Word, as with Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, David, Elijah, Elisha, John the Baptist, Peter, and the other apostles; each one of whom signifies some good or truth of heaven and the church, yet all of them in the highest sense signify the Lord. For instance, “David” in the internal sense signifies Divine truth in the spiritual kingdom, which is called the royalty of the Lord; for this reason, David in the highest sense signifies the Lord in respect to that truth and in respect to royalty; on which account it is said of David in the Word, that he is to come and reign over the sons of Israel (Ezek. 37:24, 25; Hosea 3:5).

That “Peter” signifies faith, and therefore the Lord in respect to faith, because faith is from the Lord, see above, n. 9.) From this it can be seen why “John” signifies the Lord. He signifies the Lord in respect to doctrine because it is said, “John to the seven churches,” and by “the seven churches,” in the internal sense, are meant all who are in truths from good, or in faith from charity; for it is these that constitute the church; and doctrine is what teaches these truths. From this it is that as the Lord is the Word, so is he also the doctrine of the church, for all doctrine is from the Word. (That the Lord is the doctrine of the church, because all truth that is of doctrine is from the Word, thus from the Lord, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 2531, 2859, 3712.) 20. To the seven churches signifies to all who are in truths from good or in faith from charity. This is evident from the signification of “seven,” as being all [persons]. For “seven,” in the Word signifies the beginning and end, thus an entire period and a full state, in like manner as a “week” (Arcana Coelestia, n. 728, 6508, 9228); and because “seven” signifies what is full, it also signifies all, since all constitutes what is full, for fullness, as regards those that constitute a society (here, the church), means all; therefore when magnitude is treated of in the Word, “seven” signifies what is full; but when multitude is treated of, “seven” signifies all. “Three” also in the Word signifies what is full and all (as may be seen in Arcana Coelestia n. 2788, 4495, 7715); but “seven” is used in the Word where anything holy is treated of, and “three” in all other cases (Arcana Coelestia n. 10127); therefore “seven” is here used, because truths from good, which are the holy things of the church, are treated of. It is also evident from the signification of “churches” as being those who are in truths from good, or in faith from charity. These are meant by “churches,” because such truths constitute the church with everyone; for those who are not in truths from good, though born within the church, yet are not of the church, because there is no church in them.

It is also said, who are in faith from charity, since this is similar; for truth is of faith, and good is of charity; for in fact, everything that man believes is called truth, and everything that man loves is called good. (That every truth is from good, and that everything of faith is from charity, see New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine, n. 84–107, 108–122; and Last Judgment, n. 33–39; also Heaven and Hell, n. 364, 424, 482, 526.) He who knows nothing of the internal sense of the Word, when he reads these things believes no otherwise than that by “seven churches” are meant the seven churches afterwards named (verse 11); whereas churches are not meant, but all who are of the church; because this is the spiritual sense of the Word. 21. In Asia signifies those who are in the light of intelligence. This can be seen by a spiritual idea only, such as angels have, concerning the regions of this earth. When Asia is named, angels perceive the south; when Europe is named, the north; and when Africa, the east; and as by the “south” is signified the clear light of intelligence, so that light is signified by “Asia.” This perception has been granted also to me, as often as I have been in the spiritual idea and have thought of Asia. Such is the spiritual idea of Asia, because the church was there in ancient times, and then extended over many regions there; therefore, those who are in heaven from that country are in the light of intelligence. For this reason, when Asia is thought of, a light like that which is in the south of heaven flows in. (That in ancient times, and also in the most ancient, the church was in Asia, extending through many kingdoms there, see the quotations from Arcana Coelestia in New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine, n. 247; and that the “south” signifies the light of intelligence, see in Heaven and Hell, n. 141–153, where the four quarters in heaven are treated of.) By “Asia,” however, the inhabitants of Asia are not here meant, but all, wheresoever they are, who are in the spiritual light of intelligence, or, what is the same, who are in truths from good; for those who are in truths from good are in the spiritual light of intelligence; and all such constitute the Lord’s church."

Grace to you and peace signifies the delight of truth and good. This is evident from the signification of “grace” as being the delight of truth (about which more presently); and from the signification of “peace,” as being the delight of the good of innocence and love (on which see Heaven and Hell, where the state of peace in heaven is treated of, n. 284–290). “Grace” means the delight of truth, because there are two things that proceed from the Lord, united in their origin, but separated with those that receive them. For there are those that receive more the Divine truth than the Divine good, and those that receive more the Divine good than the Divine truth. Those that receive more the Divine truth than the Divine good are in the Lord’s spiritual kingdom, and are therefore called spiritual; but those that receive more the Divine good than the Divine truth are in the Lord’s celestial kingdom, and are therefore called celestial (On these two kingdoms in heaven and in the church, see Heaven and Hell, n. 20–28.) To those in the spiritual kingdom it is granted by the Lord to be in the affection of truth for the sake of truth; and this Divine is what is called grace; so far, therefore, as anyone is in that affection is he in the Lord’s Divine grace; nor is there any other Divine grace with man, spirit, or angel, than to be affected by truth, because it is truth, since in that affection there is heaven and blessedness for them (see New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine, n. 232, 236, 238; and Heaven and Hell, n. 395–414). Whether we say the affection of truth or the delight of truth it is the same; for there is no affection without delight. [2] This in particular is what is meant by “grace” in the Word; as in John: And the Word became flesh, and dwelt in us, and we beheld his glory, a glory as of the only-begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth, of his fullness we all received, and grace for grace.

And in Luke, after the Lord had explained in the synagogue the prophesy of Isaiah respecting himself, that is, the Divine truth, it is said: All wondered at the words of grace proceeding out of his mouth (Luke 4:22). the Divine truths that the Lord spoke are called “words of grace proceeding out of his mouth,” because they are acceptable, grateful, and delightful. In general, Divine grace is all that is given from the Lord; and as all that is so given has relation to faith and love, and faith is the affection of truth from good, this is meant in particular by Divine grace; for to be gifted with faith and love, or with the affection of truth from good, is to be gifted with heaven, thus with eternal blessedness. 23. From him who is, and who was, and who is to come signifies from him who is the all in all things of heaven and of the church from eternity to eternity. This is evident from the signification of “who is, and who was, and who is to come,” as being from eternity to eternity, also the all in all things of heaven and of the church. From eternity to eternity is meant, because all times in the Word signify not times but states of life (as may be seen from what is said and shown concerning time in heaven in Heaven and Hell, n. 162–169); and as all times signify states of life, so in reference to the Lord they signify infinite state, and infinite state as to time is eternity. That all times are comprised in “who is, and who was, and who is to come,” is evident. Of eternity, which is of the Lord alone, many things might be said; but such things are not understood by the natural man, whose thoughts are chiefly based on time, space, and matter, while, nevertheless, eternity, in itself, does not include such things. If, indeed, man could think of eternity as the angels of heaven do, he might arrive at some idea of it, and thus might comprehend what from eternity is, which is signified by “who was”; also what the Divine foresight is, that it is in the most particular things from eternity; and what Divine providence is, that it is in the most"

But there is no time to go further into this arcanum as yet (something may be seen respecting it in Heaven and Hell, n. 167); only let it be known, that the like is meant by “Jehovah” as by “who is, who was, and who is to come,” since “is,” which is the meaning of Jehovah, involves what precedes, that is, “who was,” and also what is future, that is, “who is to come,” and thus signifies from eternity to eternity. [2] That “is” signifies from eternity is also known in the Christian world from the Psalm of David, where it is said: I will declare of the decree; Jehovah said unto me; thou art my son; this day have I begotten thee (Ps. 2:7); it is known that these things are said of the Lord, and that by “today” is meant from eternity. (That by “tomorrow,” also in the Word, where the Lord is treated of is signified to eternity, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 3998.) That the words “who is,” “who was,” and “who is to come” signify also the all in all things of heaven and the church is because they signify eternity; and in heaven eternity can be expressed by no other word than Divine, for the reason that what is infinite cannot fall into the angelic idea, and still less into a human idea; and eternity is infinite existere from infinite esse; but only this enters the idea, that eternity, which is the Divine in respect to existere, is the all in all things of heaven and of the church. For the whole heaven is heaven not from the angels’ proprium, but from the Divine of the Lord; nor is the church the church from the proprium of men, but from the Divine of the Lord; for all the good of love and the truth of faith are from the Lord, and it is the good of love and the truth of faith that make heaven and the church. Angels and men are only recipients, and so far as they receive, heaven and the church are in them. (These things may be seen illustrated by many things in Heaven and Hell, n. 7–12, where it is shown that the Divine of the Lord makes heaven, and that the Divine that makes heaven is the Divine human, which is the Divine existere from the Divine esse, n. 78–86.)"

This is evident from the signification of “seven,” as being what is full, and therefore all, and from its being predicated of the holy Divine things that proceed from the Lord (see above, n. 20); also from the signification of “spirits,” as being those of whom heaven consists; for all these are called “spirits of God,” since the spirit of God is the Divine proceeding, or Divine truth united to Divine good in heaven and the church (Arcana Coelestia n. 9818); and the Divine proceeding or Divine truth united to Divine good, forms and creates the angel, and thus makes him [what he is] according to quality and quantity of reception (see Heaven and Hell, n. 7–12). From this it is evident that by “the seven spirits” (of which more below), are not meant seven spirits, but all who are in heaven; as by the “seven churches” are not meant seven churches, but all who are in truths from good, or who are of the church (see above, n. 20). When this is understood, an arcanum is opened, namely, the meaning of “Jehovah God” in the Word; which is, that by “Jehovah” is meant the Divine esse, and by “God” the Divine existere in heaven. The Divine that is meant by “God” is the Divine existere in heaven, because the Divine in heaven is in many; therefore in the Hebrew language, God is called “Elohim,” in the plural; for the same reason angels are called gods, not that they are gods, but because the Divine of the Lord that is in them is meant by “God.” (That in the Word the Lord is called Jehovah from esse or essence, and God from existere or existence, see Arcana Coelestia n. 300, 3910, 6905; also that the Divine esse is Divine good, and that the Divine existere is Divine truth, n. 3061, 6280, 6880, 6905, 10579; and in general, that good is esse, and truth is existere therefrom, n. 5002.

For this reason, those in the spiritual world with whom another desires to speak appear present provided the person had formed any idea of them from sight in the world, especially if this is true of both. This is why friends meet there, and also wives and husbands; the reason is that internal sight, which is the understanding, acts as one, in a spirit, with his external sight or sight of the eye; and as spaces in the spiritual world are not like spaces in the natural world, in that world what one desires to see is near, and what he does not desire to see is far off. From this now it is that “look” signifies presence. (That “look” or “sight” signifies the understanding, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 2150, 2325, 2807, 3764, 3863, 3869, 10705; and therefore signifies presence, n. 4723; and that spaces in heaven are not like spaces in the world, see Heaven and Hell, n. 191–199.) “Look,” in respect to the Lord, as here signifies his Divine presence, because the Lord knows all, and they, in turn, know the Lord who are in love and faith towards him; consequently with such the Lord is present in the goods of love and in the truths of faith that are in them from him. For these [goods and truths] are the Lord in heaven and in the church; since the things that proceed from the Lord are not merely his, but they are himself. [2] From this it is clear how the Lord is in man; thus, how that is to be understood that he spoke in John: Abide in me, and I in you; he that abideth in me and I in him, the same beareth much fruit (John 15:4–5). He that loveth me keeps my word; and the Father and I will come unto him, and make Our abode with him (John 14:23). Jesus said to his disciples, Ye know the paraclete, the spirit of truth; for he abideth with you, and shall be in you (John 14:17)."

The Word, too, is Divine truth; and that the Word is the Lord is clear, since it is said that “the Word became flesh.” (That the “Word” signifies Divine truth, and signifies the Lord, see n. 4692, 5075, 9987.) “Look” here also signifies providence, because all presence of the Lord is providence (as may appear from what is said and shown in New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine, n. 267–279; and Heaven and Hell, n. 9, 12, 143, 145). 26. Verse 5. And from Jesus Christ signifies from the Lord as to the Divine human. This is evident from the fact that such was the Lord’s name in the world; thus the name of his human; but in respect to the Divine, his name was “Jehovah” and “God.” It is called the Divine human because the Lord made his human Divine when he was in the world; for he united it to his Divine which was in him from conception, and which was to him a soul from the Father, thus which was to him his life; for the soul of everyone is his life, and the body, which is the human, lives therefrom; when, therefore, the Divine was united to the human in the Lord, as soul to body, it is called the Divine human. (That it is according to the doctrine of the church that as soul and body make one man, so the Divine and the human make one Christ, as also that his Divine and his human make one person, see above, n. 10.) They, therefore, who think of the Lord’s human and not at the same time of his Divine, will on no account admit the expression “Divine human,” for they think of the human separately and of the Divine separately, thus, as it were, of a man separately from his soul or his life; this, however, is not to think of the man at all, still less of the Lord.

This also is in accordance with the doctrine given by the Lord himself, which is: that he and the Father are one; and that he who seeth him seeth the Father, because he is in the Father and the Father in him; that he is the way, the truth, and the life; and that no one cometh to the Father but by him. From this it is clear how much they turn aside from the way and the truth who pass by the Lord and approach the Father. But as I have conversed much on this subject with angels, and also with spirits, who, when they lived as men in the world, were of the reformed church and of the papal religion, I shall be pleased to relate these conversations in the following pages; from which it will appear in what light the church would be respecting the Divine, which is the first and primary principle of the church, if it would acknowledge and believe in the Divine human of the Lord. 27. The faithful witness signifies from whom is all truth in heaven. This is evident from the signification of “faithful witness,” as being, in reference to the Lord, the acknowledgment of the Divine human from whom is all truth in heaven (of which in what follows). It is said in heaven, because Divine truth, proceeding from the Lord’s Divine good, makes heaven in general, and with each angel there in particular. (This may be seen in Heaven and Hell, n. 13, 126–140; and that this is from the Lord’s Divine human, n. 7–12, 78–86.) The Lord as to the Divine human is called the “faithful witness,” because Divine truth proceeding from him, bears witness in heaven concerning him. This testimony is universally in the Divine truth in heaven; as may be seen from this, that angels of the interior heaven can think of the Divine in no other way than under a human form, thus as the Divine human, and for the reason that the Divine human of the Lord fills the universal heaven and forms it, and the thoughts of angels proceed and flow according to the form of heaven (see"

From this it is that “the testimony of Jesus Christ” (see n. 10) signifies the acknowledgment of the Divine of the Lord in his human. [2] From this can be seen what is meant in the spiritual sense by “bearing witness” and by “testimony” in the following passages: John [that is, the Baptist] came for a witness, that he might bear witness of the Light, that all might believe through him. He was not the Light, but came that he might bear witness of the Light. It was the true Light, which lighteth every man. And I have seen and have borne witness (John 1:7–9, 34). “Light” signifies Divine truth; therefore the Lord is here called “the true Light, which lighteth every man,” and to “bear witness of the light” signifies an acknowledgment of his Divine human, from which Divine truth proceeds. (That “light” signifies Divine truth proceeding from the Lord, see Heaven and Hell, in the chapter on the light of heaven, n. 126–140.) [3] In the same: Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth; but I receive not testimony from man (John 5:33–34). Jesus said, Verily I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and bear witness of what we have seen. He that cometh from heaven is above all. What he hath seen and heard, of that he beareth witness (John 3:11, 31–32). Jesus said, Even if I bear witness of myself, my witness is true; for I know whence I came and whither I go (John 8:14). By this is signified that he hears witness concerning himself from himself, because he was Divine truth. In the same: When the comforter is come, the spirit of truth, he shall bear witness of me (John 15:26)."

[4] In the same: Pilate said, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest it, because I am a king. For this have I been born, and for this am I come into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Everyone that is of the truth heareth my voice. Pilate said, What is truth? (John 18:37–38). The Lord thus answered when he was asked whether he was a king, because the Lord, as king, is Divine truth, for this is the royalty of the Lord in heaven, while his Divine good is the priesthood there. This is why the Lord said that he was a king, that to this end he was born, and to this end he came into the world, that he should bear witness unto the truth; and that everyone that is in truth heareth his voice; and therefore Pilate asked him, “What is truth?” thus whether that was king. (That Divine truth is the royalty of the Lord in the heavens, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 3009, 5068; and that “kings,” therefore, in the Word signify those who are in Divine truths, or abstractly from persons signify Divine truths, see n. 1672, 2015, 2069, 4575, 4581, 4966, 5044.)

The firstborn from the dead signifies from whom is all good in heaven. This is evident from the signification of the “firstborn,” as being, in reference to the Lord, Divine good in heaven, thus all good there. The “firstborn” signifies this, because by generations, in general and in particular, spiritual generations are signified, which are the generations of good and truth or of love and faith; from this it is, that by “father,” “mother,” “sons,” “daughters,” “sons-in-law,”"

This being so, by “firstborn” is not meant the firstborn, but the good of heaven and of the church, because this is in the first place. And since it is the Lord from whom all good in heaven is, he is called the “firstborn.” He is called “the firstborn from the dead,” because, when he arose from the dead, he made his human to be Divine good by union with the Divine that was in him from conception. [2] This is why he is called “the firstborn from the dead,” and says of himself in David: I will make him the firstborn, high above the kings of the earth (Ps. 89:27). What is meant by his being “high above the kings of the earth” will be seen in a subsequent article. (That the Lord, when he departed from the world, made his human Divine good, see Arcana Coelestia n. 3194, 3210, 6864, 7499, 8724, 9199, 10076; thus that he came forth from the Father and returned to the Father, n. 3194, 3210; and that after the union, the Divine truth, which is the comforter, the spirit of truth, proceeds from him, n. 3704, 3712, 3969, 4577, 5704, 7499, 8127, 8241, 9199, 9398, 9407. But this arcanum may be seen more fully explained in New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine, n. 293–295; and in the passages there cited from Arcana Coelestia, n. 303–305.) As the Lord in respect to the Divine human is called “the firstborn,” for the reason that all good proceeds from him, so all the firstborn in the Israelitish church were holy to Jehovah; so also the Levites were received in place of all the firstborn in Israel; for by the sons of Levi were represented those of the church who are in the good of charity; therefore also a double portion of inheritance was allotted to the firstborn; all this for the reason that the firstborn signified the good that is from the Lord, and in the highest sense, the Lord himself in respect to the Divine human from which is all good. For all things that were commanded in the Israelitish church were representative of Divine things, spiritual and celestial."

Thou shalt cause to pass over unto Jehovah all that openeth the womb, and every firstling that cometh of a beast, as many as thou hast, the males shall be Jehovah’s (Exod. 13:12). Thou shalt not delay to offer the firstfruits of thy produce, and the firstfruits of thy wine. The firstborn of thy sons shalt thou give unto me. Likewise shalt thou do with thine oxen and with thy sheep; seven days it shall be with its dam: on the eighth day thou shalt give it me. And ye shall be men of holiness unto me (Exod. 22:29–31). They were to give also the firstborn of beasts, because these, too, were representative; and because they represented they were also made use of in burnt offerings and sacrifices. (What the various beasts in these services represented, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 1823, 3519, 9280, 10042. Why the Levites were accepted in place of all the firstborn in Israel, see Num. 3:12, 13, 41, 45; 8:15-20, was, as was said above, because the “sons of Levi” represented, and therefore signified, the good of charity, and “Levi,” in the highest sense signified the Lord as to that good, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 3875, 3877, 4497, 4502, 4503, 10017.

One who knows not the internal sense of the Word must needs believe that the kings of the whole earth are here meant; whereas kings are not meant, nor earth; but by “kings” are meant all who are in truths from good; and by the “earth” is meant the church. (That by the “earth” is signified the church is shown in many places in Arcana Coelestia, from which these particulars may be seen: that by the “earth” is signified the kingdom of the Lord and the church, n. 662, 1066, 1068, 1262, 1413, 2928, 3355, 4447, 4535, 5577, 8011, 9325, 9643. The chief reason of which is, that by the “earth” is meant the land of Canaan; and the church was there from most ancient times, n. 567, 3686, 4447, 4454, 4516, 4517, 5136, 6516, 9325, 9327; also that, in the spiritual sense, by the “earth” is meant the nation who dwell thereon, and their worship, n. 1262.

That to “create” is to establish and regenerate, see n. 10373. That “ground,” too signifies the church; “ground” from the reception of seeds, which are truths, but “earth” from the nations therein, and their worship, see n. 566, 1068, 10570. Moreover, “earth,” as it signifies the church signifies also the religious principle, consequently also such as is idolatrous; as the land of Egypt, the land of the Philistines, the land of Chaldea, and of Babel, and many others.

That the Lord’s “blood” signifies truths from good, thus truths from the Lord, can with difficulty be seen and believed by a man who knows nothing of the internal sense of the Word; moreover, it seems far-fetched to understand truths from the Lord in place of his blood; and yet in heaven nothing else is understood by the Lord’s blood. This is because the Lord there is Divine truth united to Divine good, consequently no one there thinks of his flesh and blood. Thought concerning these they call material thought, of which there is none with them. They say, moreover, that they are not aware that flesh and blood are mentioned in the Word; for with them the things belonging to the literal sense of the Word, are changed into spiritual ideas, since they themselves are spiritual and not natural; thus “flesh” when ascribed to the Lord is changed into Divine good, and “blood” into Divine truth, each proceeding from the Lord. [2] “Flesh” and “blood” are mentioned in the literal sense of the Word, in order that corresponding spiritual things may be perceived in heaven; for all spiritual things terminate in natural things; in them they have their outmost plane, therefore the Divine passing through the heavens terminates in that plane, and thereon subsists, comparatively like a house on its foundation, and is then in its fullness. This is why the Word is such as it is in the letter, and why “flesh” and “blood” are there mentioned; the angels, however, are astonished that the man of the church, who might also be made spiritual from the Word, does not allow himself to be elevated above the sense of the letter, and thinks not spiritually but materially of the Lord, and of his flesh and blood. But because they so wondered, and it was told them that many, especially the simple, do think spiritually about these things, they explored whether it was so; and they discovered that many, and almost all the simple, when they come to the holy supper do not think at all about flesh and blood, but only of that which is holy which they then have from the Lord. The angels perceived that this is continually provided by the Lord, in order that the man of the church may then be in a spiritual and not in a material idea."

It would have been different if they had thought of the Lord according to the universal doctrine of the church, which is, that his Divine and human is one person, the two being united as soul and body (see above, n. 10, 26).

And hath made us kings and priests signifies that from him we are in his spiritual and celestial kingdom.

That these are signified by “kings” in the Word, will appear from what follows. The above is evident also from the signification of “priests,” as meaning those who are in the good of love; and since these constitute the Lord’s celestial kingdom, they also are those who are in his celestial kingdom. (That there are two kingdoms, into which the heavens are in general divided, see Heaven and Hell, n. 20–28, and that the spiritual kingdom is called the Lord’s regal kingdom, and the celestial kingdom his priestly kingdom, n. 24.) In any places in the prophetic Word, kings are mentioned, and he that is ignorant of the internal sense believes that by “kings” are there meant kings; kings, however, are not meant, but all those who are in truths from good, or in faith from charity, from the Lord. The reason of this is, that the Lord is the sole king, and those who from him are in truths from good are called his “sons”; for this reason the same are meant by “princes,” by “sons of the kingdom,” by “sons of kings,” and also by “kings”; and in a sense abstracted from the idea of persons, as it is in heaven, truths from good are"

[2] That kings are not meant can be seen simply from its here being said that Jesus Christ “hath made us kings and priests”; and afterwards: And hast made us to be unto our God kings and priests, and we shall reign upon the earth (Rev. 5:10); and in Matthew: The good seed sown in the field are the sons of the kingdom (Matt. 13:38); the “seed of the field” are truths from good with man from the Lord (Arcana Coelestia, n. 3373, 10248, 10249). Everyone, moreover, may perceive that the Lord will not make all those here treated of to be kings, but that he calls them kings from the power and the glory which those have who from the Lord are in truths from good. From this it can now be seen that by “king,” in the prophetic Word, is meant the Lord as to Divine truth, and by “kings” and “princes,” those who from the Lord are in truths from good, and as most things in the Word have also an opposite sense, that “kings” signify in that sense those who are in falsities from evil. [3] That by “King” in the Word is meant the Lord in respect to Divine truth is clear from the words of the Lord himself to Pilate: Pilate said, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest it, because I am a king. For this have I been born, and for this am I come into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Everyone that is in the truth heareth my voice. Pilate said unto him, What is truth? (John 18:37, 38). From the question of Pilate, “What is truth,” it is clear that he understood that truth was called “king” by the Lord; but as he was a Gentile, and knew nothing from the Word, he could not be"

And when the chiefs of the priests said unto him, Write not, The king of the Jews, but that he saith I am the king of the Jews, Pilate answered, What I have written, I have written (John 19:4, 19–22). [4] When these things are understood, it may be known what is meant by “kings” in the following passages in Revelation: The sixth angel poured out his bowl upon the great river Euphrates, and the water thereof was dried up, that the way might be made ready for the kings that come from the sun rising (Rev. 16:12). The great harlot that sitteth upon many waters, with whom the kings of the earth committed fornication (Rev. 17:1–2). The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sitteth, and they are seven kings; the five are fallen, the one is, the other is not yet come. And the ten horns that thou sawest are ten kings, who have received no kingdom as yet, but they receive power as kings with the beast for one hour. These shall war against the lamb, and the lamb shall overcome them; for he is Lord of lords and king of kings (Rev. 17:9, 10, 12, 14). And the woman whom thou sawest is the great city, which hath the kingdom over the kings of the earth (Rev. 17:18). Of the wine of the wrath of her fornication all the nations have drunk, and the kings of the earth committed fornication with her (Rev. 18:3). And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together, to make war against him that sat on the horse and against his army (Rev. 19:19).

By “the king of the south” are there meant those who are in the light of truth from good, by “the king of the north” those who are in darkness from evil. (That “south” in the Word signifies those who are in the light of truth from good, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 1458, 3708, 3195, 5672, 9642; and “north” those who are in the darkness of falsity from evil, n. 3708, and in general, Heaven and Hell, n. 141–153, where the four quarters in heaven are treated of.) [5] “Kings” are also frequently mentioned by the prophets in the Old Testament; and there likewise are meant those who, from the Lord, are in truths from good, and in a contrary sense, those who are in falsities from evil; as in Isaiah: He shall disperse3 many nations: kings shall shut their mouths upon him; for that which had not been told them they have seen, and that which they have not heard they have understood (Isa. 52:15). The Zion of the holy one of Israel, thou shalt suck the milk of the nations, and shalt suck the breast of kings (Isa. 40:14, 16). Kings shall be thy nursing fathers, and the chief women thy nursing mothers; they shall bow down to thee with their face toward the earth (Isa. 49:23; and elsewhere, as in Isa. 14:9; 24:21; 60:10; Jer. 2:26; 4:9; 49:38; Lam. 2:6, 9; Ezek. 7:26, 27; Hos. 3:4; Zeph. 1:8; Ps. 2:10; 110:5; Gen. 49:20). 31b. [6] Since “kings” signify those who, from the Lord, are in truths from good, it was a custom derived from ancient times for kings, when they were crowned, to receive such insignia as signify truths from good; as for the king to be anointed with oil, to wear a crown of gold, to hold a scepter in his right hand, to be clothed with a purple cloak, to sit upon a throne of silver, and to ride with the royal insignia upon a white horse; for “oil” signifies good from"

That the ceremonies observed at the coronation of kings involve such things, but that the knowledge thereof is at this day lost, see also Arcana Coelestia, n. 4581, 4966). [7] As it is known from these things what is meant by a “king” in the Word, I will add to the above: Why the Lord, when he entered Jerusalem, sat upon the foal of an ass, and the people then proclaimed him king, and also strewed their garments in the way (Matt. 21:1–8; Mark 11:1–11; Luke 19:28–40; John 12:14–16). This is predicted in Zechariah: Exult, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem; behold, thy king cometh unto thee, just and having salvation; riding upon an ass, and upon the foal of an ass (Zech. 9:9; Matt. 21:5; John 12:15). The reason was, that to sit upon an ass and the foal of an ass was the distinctive mark of the highest judge and of a king; as can be seen from the following passages: My heart is towards the lawgivers of Israel, ye who ride upon white asses (Judg. 5:9–10). The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgivers from between his feet, till Shiloh come; who shall bind his ass’s foal to the vine, and the son of his she-ass to the noble vine (Gen. 49:10, 11)."

One who does not know the signification of “horse,” “mule,” and “the foal of an ass,” in a representative sense, will suppose that the Lord’s riding upon the foal of an ass was significative of misery and humiliation. But it signified royal magnificence; for this reason the people then proclaimed the Lord king, and strewed their garments upon the way. This was done when he went to Jerusalem, because by “Jerusalem” is signified the church (as may be seen in New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine, n. 6; and that “garments” signify truths clothing and serving good, may be seen in Arcana Coelestia, n. 1073, 2576, 5248, 5319, 5954, 9212, 9215, 9216, 9952, 10536; and in Heaven and Hell, n. 177–182). [8] From this it is now clear what is signified by the “king” and by “kings,” in the Word, so also what by the “anointed,” “Messiah,” and “Christ”; for “anointed,” “Messiah,” and “Christ,” like “king,” signify the Lord as to Divine truth proceeding from his Divine good; for a king is called “anointed”; and “anointed” in the Hebrew is Messiah, and in the Greek Christ. But that the Lord, as to the Divine human, was alone “the Anointed of Jehovah,” since in him alone was the Divine good of Divine Love from conception, for he was conceived of Jehovah, but that all that were anointed were only representatives of him (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 9954, 10011, 10268–10269). But “priests” signify such good as exists in the celestial kingdom (see in Arcana Coelestia, namely, that priests represented the Lord, as to Divine good, n. 2015, 6148; that the priesthood was representative of the Lord as to the work of salvation, since this was from the Divine good of his Divine Love,"

Unto God and his Father signifies by Divine truth and Divine good. This is evident from this, that “God” is the Divine truth, and “Jehovah” is the Divine good; therefore in the Word the Lord is called “God” when Divine truth is treated of, and “Jehovah” when Divine good is treated of (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 2586, 2769, 2807, 2822, 3921, 4287, 4402, 7010, 9167); but here it is said “Father” instead of Jehovah, because the Father of the Lord was Jehovah, and by “Father” the like is meant as by “Jehovah.” By both “God” and “the Father” the Lord alone is meant; for the Father was in him as the soul is in its body (see above, n. 10, 26); since he was conceived of Jehovah, and one’s soul is from him of whom he is conceived; consequently when the Lord spoke of the Father he meant his Divine in himself. This was why he said: That the Father is in him and he in the Father (John 10:38; 14:10, 11). That the Father and he are one (John 10:30). That he is not alone, but he and the Father (John 16:32).

To him be the glory and the might unto the ages of the ages signifies that these things, namely, Divine good and Divine truth, are from the Lord alone to eternity. This is evident from the signification of “glory,” as meaning Divine truth in heaven (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 4809, 5922, 8267, 8427, 9429); and from the signification of “might,” as meaning Divine good through Divine truth, since Divine good has all might and all power through Divine truth (see n. 3091, 3563, 6344, 6423, 8304, 9643, 10019, 10182; and Heaven and Hell, where the power of the angels of heaven from the Lord is treated of, n. 228–233). That “unto the ages of the ages” means to eternity is clear without explanation. “Glory” is Divine truth in heaven because Divine truth is the light there; and the things that have existence from the light of heaven are called “glory,” because they have existence from the Lord and represent the Divine truth that is from him, and declare his glory; especially the things that are within the angel, which are of intelligence and wisdom. (That the light of heaven is Divine truth, and that all things that are in heaven, whether without or within the angel, have existence from the light there, see Heaven and Hell, n. 126–140, 172–173, 176.) It is believed in the world that “Glory be to God” means that God for his own sake desires glory from man, and that he is moved by it, and imparts blessings in return for it. But this is a mistake. God desires glory from man for man’s sake; for thus man ascribes all things to the Divine and nothing to himself, and when he does this, the Divine can flow in with Divine truth, and give him intelligence and wisdom. Thus and no otherwise is the Lord glorified in man; for the Lord loves everyone, and, from love, desires that his glory, that is, Divine truth, may be in men. This, moreover, the Lord teaches in John: If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask whatever ye will, and it shall be done unto you. Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit, and that ye be made my disciples (John 15:7–8)."

Amen signifies Divine confirmation. This is evident from the signification of “amen,” as meaning truth, for this is the meaning of “amen” in the Hebrew; and as all truth which is truth is Divine, “amen,” when said in the Word signifies Divine confirmation. For truth confirms all things, and Divine truth confirms itself; and it was because the Lord when he was in the world was Divine truth itself, that he so frequently said “amen” [usually translated “verily”]. 35.

That “clouds” signify Divine truths in ultimates is from appearances in the spiritual world. There clouds appear in various kinds of light; in the inmost or third heaven in a flaming light, in the middle or second heaven in a bright white light, and in the outmost or first heaven in a light more dense; and everyone there knows that they signify Divine truth from the Lord through the angels; for when Divine truth proceeding from the Lord, which is the very light of heaven, passes through the angels, it appears as a cloud, purer or denser according to their intelligence. Such clouds have oftentimes been seen by me, and what they signify has also been perceived. This is why “clouds,” such as those that appear before the eyes of men in the world signify Divine truth in ultimates; and as the Word in the letter is Divine truth in ultimates, that is what is meant by “clouds.” [2] He who does not know that “clouds” have this signification, may suppose that the Lord is about to come in clouds for the last judgment, and to appear in glory; according to his words in the Evangelists, where he says: Then shall appear the sign of the son of man in heaven, and they shall see the son of man coming in the clouds of heaven, with power and much glory (Matt. 24:30; Mark 13:26; Luke 21:27). “The consummation of the age” which is there treated of is the last time of the church; and the Lord’s coming at that time is the revelation of himself, and of Divine truth which is from him, in the Word, through the internal sense. Elsewhere than in the Word the Lord does not reveal himself, nor does he reveal himself there except through the internal sense. The Word in the internal sense is also signified by “power” and “glory.” (That this is fulfilled at this day, namely that the age is consummated, and the last judgment accomplished; and also that the Lord has come in the clouds of heaven, that is, has revealed the internal sense of the Word, may be seen in Last Judgment, from beginning to end; also in Heaven and Hell, n. 1; also in New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine, n. 249–266."

That the “eye” signifies understanding and faith is from correspondence; for understanding is internal sight, and it is internal sight that sees by means of the eye, for that sight determines the eye to objects and disposes its interior parts, which are many, for reception. It is in consequence of this that the iris and pupil seem now dilated, now contracted, now obscure, now bright and sometimes sparkling, altogether in agreement with the desire and want of the understanding. Therefore, to some extent, the affection of the thought can be seen from the eyes. It is from this correspondence that the eye signifies the understanding. The eye also signifies faith, because truths of faith have no other abode than the understanding; truths that do not abide there are not in the man (see New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine, n. 28–36). The “eye” is, in the spiritual sense, faith, also because of the angels looking to the Lord; for angels turn their faces continually to the Lord, and see him by faith and understanding.

And as such were signified by “soldiers,” the soldiers divided the Lord’s garments, and cast lots upon his coat; which means that the Jewish church dispersed the Divine truths that are in the sense of the letter of the Word, but were unable to disperse interior truths, or the truths of the internal sense (for “garments” signify truths in ultimates; see Arcana Coelestia, n. 2576, 5248, 6918, 9158, 9212; “to divide” signifies to dissipate and disperse, see n. 4424, 6360–6361, 9093; and “the coat” interior truths, n. 9048, 9212, 9216, 9826). 39. And all the tribes of the earth shall lament over him signifies that the falsities of the church will oppose. This is evident from the signification of “lamenting” as being to mourn, to grieve, to be displeased, to be angry, to be averse from, thus also to oppose; and from the signification of “tribes,” as being all truths and goods in the complex, and in the contrary sense, all falsities and evils in the complex (of which in what follows); also from the signification of “the earth,” as being the church (see above, n. 29). By “all the tribes of the earth,” then, the whole church is meant, and by “their lamenting over him” is signified that truth and good will be no more, because falsities and evils are to prevail and oppose. For this verse treats, in general, of what the state of the church will be at its end, when there will be no longer any faith, because no charity, namely, that the Lord will then reveal himself, and that all who are in truths from good will acknowledge him, and that they also will see him, who are in falsities from evil, but that the falsities of the church will oppose. (That Revelation does not treat of the successive states of the church, but of its last state when it is at its end, see above, n. 5; and that its end is when there is no faith, because no charity, see Last Judgment, n. 33–39 seq.; and when"

[2] In the Word “tribes” are often mentioned, inasmuch as the Israelitish people were divided into twelve tribes, and one who does not know the internal sense of the Word supposes that by “tribes” are meant the tribes of Israel; but by “tribes” are not meant tribes, nor by “Israel” is Israel meant, but by “tribes” are meant all those who are in truths from good, and by “Israel” the Lord’s church. He who is ignorant of this will easily adopt the common belief that the sons of Israel were chosen in preference to all others on earth, and that they are also to be brought at last into the land of Canaan; indeed, that heaven also is to be formed chiefly from them; when, in fact, by their names they are not meant, but they who are in truths from good, thus those who are of the church; by the twelve tribes, all such, and by each tribe, some particular truth and good pertaining to those who are of the church. [3] When this is understood, what is meant by these words in Revelation can be seen: I heard the number of them which were sealed, a hundred and forty and four thousand sealed of all the tribes of the sons of Israel. Of the tribe of Judah were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Reuben were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Gad were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Asher were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Naphtali were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Manasseh were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Simeon were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Levi were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Issachar were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Zebulon were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Joseph were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Benjamin were sealed twelve thousand (Rev. 7:4–8). Here those who are of the Israelitish nation are not meant, but all, how many soever, who are in the truths from good, for all such are sealed for heaven. Moreover, the numbers “one hundred and forty- four thousand” and “twelve thousand” signify all; and each tribe signifies all who are in that truth or good which is signified by its name, as may appear from what is shown in Arcana Coelestia; as"

The wall was a hundred and forty and four cubits, and the length and the breadth of the city twelve thousand furlongs (Rev. 21:12, 14, 16–17). What is signified by all this you will see explained in New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine (n. 1); namely, that by “Jerusalem” is signified the church in respect to doctrine; by its “wall,” protecting truths; by the “gates,” introductory truths; by the” foundations,” the knowledges on which doctrine is based; by “twelve angels,” and by “twelve tribes,” all truths and goods in the complex; “the twelve"

[5] Furthermore, he who is aware that such things are signified by the twelve tribes can see the arcanum in this: Why the names of the twelve tribes were engraved on the precious stones in the Urim and Thummim, likewise what that breastplate signified (Exod. 28:21; 39:10–15). (This arcanum may be seen unfolded in Arcana Coelestia, n. 3858, 6335, 6640, 9863, 9865, 9873, 9874, 9905.)

Also what is meant by: The predictions of Israel, the father, respecting his sons (Gen. 49:2–28); as well as numerous other passages of the Word, where tribes are mentioned (as in Isa. 19:13; 49:6; 63:17; Jer. 10:16; Ezek. 48:1 seq.; Ps. 122:3–5; Deut. 32:8; Num. 24:2; Rev. 5:9; 7:4–9; 11:9; 13:7; 14:6; and elsewhere).

Even so, amen signifies Divine confirmation that so it will be. This is evident from the signification of “even so,” as being a confirmation of what goes before, that so it will be; and from the signification of “amen,” as being Divine confirmation (see above, n. 34). 41. Verse 8. I am the alpha and the omega, beginning and end signifies that he governs all things from firsts through ultimates, and thus all things of heaven to eternity. This is evident from the signification of “the alpha and the omega,” as being the first and the last, or in firsts and in ultimates; and he who is in firsts and in ultimates also governs intermediates, thus all things. These things are said of the Lord’s Divine human, for they are said of Jesus Christ, by which name his Divine human is meant (see above, n. 26). By means of this the Lord is in firsts and in ultimates. But that he governs all things from firsts through ultimates is an arcanum that cannot as yet be perceived by man; for man knows nothing of the successive degrees into which the heavens are divided, and into which also the interiors of man are divided; and he scarcely knows that man as to flesh and bones is in his ultimates. Neither does he perceive how intermediates are governed from firsts through ultimates; and yet in order that he might thus govern all things, the Lord came into the world that even to ultimates, that is, even to flesh and bones, he might assume the human and glorify it, that is, make it Divine. That the Lord put on such a human, and took it with him into heaven, is known in the church from this, that he left nothing of his body in the sepulcher; also from his own words to his disciples:"

But this arcanum is not carried further because more must be known whereby an idea of the Divine government from firsts through ultimates may be formed and acquired.

From this it is clear that the Lord alone is powerful, and no one else in heaven except from the Lord. The reason is that the Divine of the Lord is the all in all things in heaven, for this makes heaven in general, and with each one in particular. Moreover, by him were all things created that were created, thus heaven and earth, as he himself teaches in John: In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and God was the Word. All things were made through him; and without him was not anything made that hath been made. In him was life, and the life was the light of men. And the Word became flesh, and dwelt in us (John 1:1, 3–4, 14). By “the Word” is meant the Divine truth which is in the heavens, and from which are all things there. That this is the Lord in respect to the Divine human is evident, for it is said, “And the Word became flesh, and dwelt in us.” And because all the life of the angels is therefrom, likewise all the light in the heavens, it is said, “In him was life, and the life was the light of men.” (But all these things may be seen more fully illustrated in Heaven and Hell, namely, that the Divine of the Lord makes heaven, n. 7–12; that this is his Divine human, n. 78–86; that all the life of angels is therefrom, n. 9; and also all light in heaven, n. 126–140; that angels have all their power from the Lord, and none at all from themselves, n. 228–233.) From this it is clear that “Almighty” means to be, to live, and to have power, from himself. That the Lord’s Divine human has being, life, and power from itself equally with his Divine in himself, which is called the Father, the Lord also teaches: As the Father hath life in himself, so gave he to the son to have life in himself (John 5:26); and that no one else has life in himself Jesus declares: Without me ye can do nothing (John 15:5)."

The Divine that has revealed itself is the Divine human. (That without acknowledgment of the Divine in the Lord’s human there is no salvation, see New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine, n. 280–310.) From this now it is that “John,” because he represents the Lord in respect to doctrine, also represents doctrine respecting the Lord. 46. Who also am your brother signifies and respecting the good of love to him. This is evident from the signification of “brother,” as being the good of love. “Brother” signifies the good of love, because in heaven there are no other than spiritual relationships, thus no other brotherhoods; for those there do not become brothers by birth; moreover, those who were brothers in the world do not recognize each other there, but each regards the other from the good of love; those most closely conjoined regarding each other as brothers; and others, according to their conjunction by good, regarding each other as kinsmen and as friends. This is why in the Word “brother” signifies the good of love. This, moreover, the Lord teaches where it is said: One said unto Jesus, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand without seeking to speak with thee: but he answered and said, Who is my mother, and who are my brethren? (Matt. 12:47-50). My mother and my brethren are they who bear the Word of God and do it (Luke 8:18–21). One is your teacher, Christ, and all ye are brethren (Matt. 23:8). From this it is evident what it is to be a “brother in the Lord.” (But see what has been shown before respecting this; as that all are consociated in heaven according to spiritual kinships, which are the kinships of the good of love and faith, and that such recognize each other as kindred, in Heaven and Hell, n. 205; and in Arcana Coelestia, n. 685, 917, 2739, 3612, 3815, 4121; consequently by"

And partaker in the affliction signifies the truth of faith infested by falsities. This is evident from the signification of “partaker,” as being the truth of faith (concerning which see below); and from the signification of “affliction,” as being infestation by falsities (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 6663, 6851, 9196). In the Word frequent mention is made of “brother” and “partaker” (or companion), and by these good and truth are signified. Moreover, in ancient times those were called “brethren” who were in good and those were called “partakers” (or companions) who were in truths, and for this reason, that truth must be in company with good, and when it is in company, it becomes a brother; consequently here by “partaker” is signified the truth of faith. (That good and truth are meant by “brother” and “companion” in the Word, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 6756, 10490.) “Affliction” signifies infestation by falsities, since a mind that is in truths is afflicted by falsities, when the two are in conflict with each other; spiritual affliction is from no other source. This, therefore, is what is signified by “affliction” in the Word, as in Matthew: He that was sown upon the rocky places hath no root in himself; when affliction and persecution ariseth because of the Word, straightway he is offended (Matt. 13:20–21). In the consummation of the age they shall deliver you up into affliction. For then shall be great affliction, such as hath not been from the beginning of the world until now, no, nor shall be. Immediately after the affliction of those days the sun shall be darkened (Matt. 24:9, 21, 29; Mark 13:19, 24)."

And in the kingdom signifies in the church where truths are. This is evident from the signification of “kingdom” in the Word, as being heaven and the church. It means the church in respect to truth, or where truths are, because by the royalty of the Lord is signified Divine truth proceeding from him, and therefore by “kings” are signified truths (see what is shown above, n. 31). It is said the church in respect to truth, by which is meant the church in respect to truths from good; and for the reason that there are no truths without good, for truths have their life from good. Truths with a man who is not in good are indeed truths in themselves, but they are not truths in him (as may be seen abundantly shown in New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine, n. 11–27). [2] That “kingdom” in the Word signifies heaven and the church in respect to truths is evident from many passages in the Word, some of which I will cite. Thus in Matthew: The sons of the kingdom shall be cast forth into the outer darkness (Matt. 8:12); the “sons of the kingdom” here are those of the church where truths do not prevail, but falsities. In the same: He that heareth the Word of the kingdom, and giveth not heed to it, the evil one cometh, and snatcheth away that which hath been sown in his heart. This is he that was sown by the wayside. The field is the world; the seed are the sons of the kingdom (Matt. 13:19, 38). “To hear the Word of the kingdom” is to hear the truths of the church; and because “seed” signifies truths, they who receive truths are called “sons of the kingdom.” (That “seed” is the truth of the"

In the same: Therefore the kingdom of God shall be taken away from you, and shall be given to a nation bringing forth fruit (Matt. 21:43). It is evident that “the kingdom of God” here signifies the church in respect to truths, thus also the truths of the church, from its being said that “it should be taken away from them, and given to a nation bringing forth fruit”; “fruit” is good. Again in the same: In the consummation of the age, nation shall be stirred up against nation, and kingdom against kingdom (Matt. 24:3, 7). The consummation of the age” is the last time of the church, “nation against nation” is evil against good, and “kingdom against kingdom” is falsity against truth. (That “nation” is the good of the church, and in the opposite sense the evil there, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 1059, 1159, 1258–1260, 1416, 1849, 6005.) [3] From this it is plain what is meant by “kingdom” in the Lord’s prayer: Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, as in heaven, so also upon the earth. Thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory (Matt. 6:10, 13). “Thy kingdom come” is a prayer that truth may be received; “thy will be done,” that it may be received by those who do God’s will; “Thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory,” means Divine truth from God alone; it is also said “power and glory,” because Divine truth has all power and glory (see above, n. 33). From all this it can be seen what “the kingdom of God” signifies in very many passages in the Word, namely, the church in respect to truths, and also heaven, and in the highest sense the Lord in respect to the Divine human. “Kingdom,” in the highest sense signifies the Lord in respect to the Divine human, because from him all Divine truth proceeds; and “kingdom” signifies heaven, because heaven with the angels is from no other source than from the Divine truth"

That by “Jesus Christ” is meant the Lord in respect to the Divine in his human, see above (n. 26). The church of which this is said is the church that is to come after the present one, for it is said “in the expectation.” The church that is at this day knows, indeed, that the Divine is in the human of the Lord; for it knows that according to the accepted doctrine, the Divine and the human are not two but one person; also that they are like soul and body in man (see above, n. 10, 26). And yet it does not know that the Lord’s human is Divine, for it separates the one from the other, as is clear from this, that those who are of the church do not admit the expression “Divine human”; also that they approach the Father, that he may have compassion for the sake of the son when yet the Divine itself in heaven is the Divine human (see Heaven and Hell, n. 78–86). And because this knowledge and acknowledgment have thus perished, and yet it is the chief thing of all things of the church, as it is the chief thing of all things in heaven, therefore a new church is being established by the Lord among the nations, where this is not only known but also acknowledged. This, then, is what is signified by “the expectation of Jesus Christ.” 50. Was in the isle that is called Patmos signifies revelation to the nations. This is evident from the signification of “Patmos,” as being the revelation contained in Revelation; for all places mentioned in the Word signify things, and the things they signify are from the worship there, or from some memorable event that occurred there, or from their location in or near countries whereby the religious principle of the nation is signified. “Patmos” signifies revelation, from the memorable fact that there a revelation was made to John."

That this is signified by “islands” in the Word, will be clear from what follows; in the first place something shall be said about names of places in the Word signifying things. All persons mentioned in the Word, and all by whom the Word was written, were led to places that were significant, in order that all things might be significative of spiritual things. Even the Lord himself, for the same reason, went to places thus significative; as into Galilee, to Tyre and Sidon, to Jerusalem, and to the Mount of Olives there, and also, when an infant, he was carried into Egypt. It was similar with the prophets, and with many who are mentioned in the historical Word, as may be abundantly shown. For this reason, John also was commanded to betake himself into the isle of Patmos, that the things that are to be at the end of the church might there be revealed, because “island” signifies a nation about to accept truths of doctrine. This island, moreover, is in the archipelago, where there are numerous other islands; and from this also it is that by “Greece” in the Word such nations are signified. (Thus in Dan. 8:21; 10:20; 11:2; John 12:20–21; Mark 7:26 seq.) (That all names of places mentioned in the Word signify things, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 1224, 1264, 1876, 1888, 4310, 4442, 10329.) [2] That “islands” signify nations that are about to accede to the true worship of God is evident from the following passages. In Isaiah: Glorify Jehovah in Urim, the name of the God of Israel in the isles of the sea (Isa. 24:15). He shall not quench nor break, until he have set judgment in the earth: and the isles shall hope in his law. Sing unto Jehovah a new song, his praises, ye ends of the earth: ye that go down to the sea, the isles, and the inhabitants thereof. Let them give glory unto Jehovah, and declare his praise in the islands (Isa. 42:4, 10, 12). Listen, O isles, unto me, and hearken, ye peoples from afar (Isa. 49:1)."

And in Zephaniah: Jehovah will make lean all the gods of the earth, that they may worship him, everyone in his place, even all the isles of the nations (Zeph. 2:11). (And elsewhere as in Isa. 23:2, 6; 41:1, 5; 42:15; 66:19; Jer. 2:10; 25:22; Ezek. 27:3, 7, 15, 35.) From these and other passages it is plain that “isles” signify nations, specifically nations in respect to the doctrine of truth, in other places in respect to the doctrine of falsity; for most things in the Word have also opposite significations. 51. For the Word of God signifies that Divine truth may be received. This is evident from the signification of “the Word of God,” as being Divine truth (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 4692, 5075, 9987). 52.

These things are said concerning the church of the Gentiles, which is about to receive Divine truth and acknowledge the Lord’s Divine human.

This is why such as these can have no idea of the Divine; although it is the idea that conjoins, because thought conjoins; and moreover, without conjunction with the Divine through thought and affection, or what is the same, through faith and love, there is no salvation. It is said that conjunction through thought and affection is the same as conjunction through faith and love, since what I believe, that I think, and what I love, by that I am affected. To believe in the invisible is much the same as believing in the inmost of nature, an error to which the mind readily lapses when it indulges in its own fantasies. Yet there is implanted within everyone, from heaven, and this by continual influx therefrom, a desire to see what he regards as the Divine, and this, indeed, under the human form. [2] This desire is implanted in the simpleminded, and also with well-disposed Gentiles (see Heaven and Hell, n. 82). All such therefore, if they have also lived a life of charity, are received by the Lord, and heaven is granted them. No others can be received, because they are not conjoined. (That all angels in heaven, also the most wise in ancient times, and all who have spiritual faith, that is, a living faith, both on this earth and on all the earths in the universe, see their Divine in thought, because they acknowledge the Divine human, and are therefore accepted by the Lord, see New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine, n. 280–310; Heaven and Hell, n. 79–86, 316, 321; and Earths in the Universe, n. 7, 40, 41, 65, 68, 91, 98, 99, 107, 121, 141, 154, 158, 159, 169.) Because this implanted desire, which is in everyone from heaven, has been almost wholly rejected among the learned of the world, and access to the Divine thereby debarred, therefore, a new church is now being established by the Lord, among the Gentiles that have not extirpated that idea, and faith along with it. The extirpation from the Christian world of this implanted desire had its first beginning with the Babylonish body, which separated the Lord’s human from his Divine, in order that its chief might be acknowledged as the vicar of the Lord’s human, and might thus transfer to himself the Lord’s Divine power, saying that the Lord received that power from the Father, when in fact it was from himself, because it was from"

But on this subject, as it is the chief thing of all things in the church, more will be said hereafter. 53. Verse 10. I was in the spirit signifies a spiritual state when there is revelation. This is evident from the signification of “to be in the spirit,” as being to be brought into the state in which spirits and angels are, which state is a spiritual state. Into this state a man is brought when he is let into the state of his spirit, for every man is a spirit as regards his interiors (see Heaven and Hell, n. 432–444). When a man is in that state, the things that are in the spiritual world appear to him as clearly as objects appear in the natural world; but the things that appear, because they are of spiritual origin, are in themselves spiritual, and such things as are of heavenly wisdom are presented as it were in a natural image. In this way Divine things are presented before the eyes of spirits and angels in visible forms. From this it is that all things that are seen in heaven are representative and significative, as were also the things seen by John, as described in Revelation. (The character of such things can be further learned from what is said and shown concerning representatives and appearances in heaven, in Heaven and Hell, n. 170–176.) [2] While man is in the body he does not see such things as are in heaven, unless the sight of his spirit is opened; when this is opened, then he sees. In this way John saw the things described in Revelation; and in like manner the prophets saw; and they were therefore called seers, and were said to have their eyes opened. In this way also angels were seen in ancient times, and the Lord also was thus seen by the disciples after his resurrection. This sight is the sight of the spiritual man; and because in this state all things appear representatively, John was in it. He who knows nothing about this sight, believes that angels, when seen by men, have taken on a human form, and that when they vanished from their sight they laid it aside; but this is not so; angels then appeared in their own form, which is the human form, not before the sight of men’s bodily eyes, but before the sight of their spirit, which sight was then"

This is evident from the Lord’s being seen by the disciples [after his resurrection], when he himself showed to them that he was a man in a complete human form (Luke 24:39; John 20:20–28); and yet he became invisible. When they saw him the eyes of their spirit were opened, but when he became invisible those eyes were closed. That man has such a sight is clear to me from much experience, for all things I have seen in the heavens have been seen by that sight. At such times I was in the same state of wakefulness as when they were not seen. But at the present time that sight is seldom opened to anyone by the Lord, and for many reasons. 54. On the Lord’s day signifies Divine influx then. This is evident from the signification of “the Lord’s day,” as being then the Lord is instructing man, thus when he is flowing in. The Lord’s day is the day of the Sabbath, and the Sabbath in the ancient churches, which were representative churches, was the most holy thing of worship, because it signified the union of the Divine and the human in the Lord, and thence also the conjunction of his Divine human with heaven (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 8494–8495, 10356, 10360, 10370, 10374, 10668). But when the Lord had united his Divine with his human that holy representative ceased, and that day became a day of instruction (n. 10360). For this reason revelation was made to John on the Lord’s day. Revelation here is instruction concerning the state of the church. 55. And I heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet signifies manifest perception of Divine truth about to be revealed from heaven. This is evident from the signification of “hearing,” as being to perceive and obey (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 2542, 3869, 4653, 5017, 7216, 8361, 8990, 9311, 9397); and from the signification of “behind me,” as being manifestly (of which hereafter); and from the signification of “voice,” when heard out of heaven, as being Divine truth (see Arcana Coelestia n. 219–220, 3563, 6971, 8813, 8914); and from the signification of a “trumpet,” as being truth to be revealed out of heaven (of which hereafter). “Behind me” signifies manifestly, because the things that flow in from heaven into man’s affection flow in into the occipital region, and come"

(Concerning this influx, see Heaven and Hell, n. 251.) From this it is clear what is signified by John’s having heard “behind him,” and by his afterwards “having turned to see the voice which spoke with him.” A “trumpet” or “horn” signifies Divine truth about to be revealed out of heaven, because sometimes Divine truth is heard in this way when it flows down from the Lord through the heavens with man; for it is increased in coming down; and it thus flows in. But it is thus heard only in the beginning with those through whom Divine truth is to be revealed in the ultimate sense, which is representative of interior things. But afterwards it is heard as a human voice. From this it is evident why “the voice of a trumpet” or “horn” signifies Divine truth about to be revealed out of heaven. [2] He who is aware that “trumpet” or “horn” signifies Divine truth out of heaven can understand many passages in the Word where these are mentioned. As in Matthew: He shall send forth his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together the elect from the four winds (Matt. 24:31). In Isaiah: All ye inhabitants of the world, and ye dwellers on the earth, when the sign of the mountains shall be lifted up, see ye; and when the trumpet is blown, hear ye (Isa. 18:3). In Jeremiah: Proclaim with the trumpet in the land. Set up a standard towards Zion. How long shall I see the standard, and hear the sound of the trumpet? For my people are foolish, they are sottish sons, and they have no understanding (Jer. 4:5–6, 21–22). I set watchmen over you, saying, Hearken to the sound of the trumpet. But they said, We will not hearken. Therefore hear, ye nations (Jer. 6:17–18)."

But it is not permitted to adduce more on these subjects at present, because up to this time they have been unknown; only these few things have been said that it may be known what is involved in John’s hearing a voice behind him, and his turning to see it; and why it is that this signifies the understanding illustrated; it is because what enters through the will into the understanding, or through love into faith, comes into illustration, since what man wills or loves, that he clearly perceives. It is otherwise if it enters by the way of the understanding alone. It is said “to see the voice,” because by “seeing,” when predicated of spiritual things, is signified understanding from illustration (as was shown above, n. 11); and unless “seeing” signified understanding it could not have been said “to see the voice.” 62.

(That this is so, see New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine, n. 12; and Heaven and Hell, n. 57, 221–227.) The “seven lamp stands” here mean the new heaven and the new church, for these are treated of at the end of Revelation (see chapter 21), and thus the conclusion of all things therein; and because that which is last is also first, the prediction respecting these is presented at the beginning. Moreover, it is also customary in the Word to mention in the beginning things that are to take place at the end, because intermediates are thus included; for, in the spiritual sense, the first is the end for the sake of which, as that is both first and last, and to it all other things look (see New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine, n. 98). [2] That “lamp stand” signifies heaven and the church is evident from the description of the lamp stand which was in the tabernacle, for by the tabernacle the whole heaven in the complex was represented; and by the lamp stand therein, the spiritual heaven, which is the second heaven (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 3478, 9457, 9481, 9485, 9548–9577, 9783). That this is so is clearly evident from John’s seeing “in the midst of the seven lamp stands one like unto the son of man”; “the son of man” is the Lord in respect to his Divine human, from which is Divine truth, which is the all in all things of heaven and the church. In the spiritual heaven also lamp stands appear in much magnificence; by these that heaven is represented. These it has been given me to see. From this it can be seen what is meant in the Word, in the spiritual sense, by “lamp stands” and by “lamps” in the following passages.

And I said, I have seen, and behold a lamp stand all of gold, its bowl on the top of it, and its seven lamps thereon, with seven pipes to the lamps (Zech. 4:2, 3). Here Zerubbabel is treated of, who was to lay the foundation of the house of God, and to finish it. By Zerubbabel is represented the Lord, that he was about to come and restore heaven and the church; these are the “lamp stands” and the holy truths there are “the seven lamps.” [3] Because a lamp stand takes its representative meaning from the lamps, and the lamps from light, which in heaven is Divine truth, so the Lord is also called “a lamp,” as in Revelation: The holy Jerusalem hath no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it; the glory of God shall lighten7 it, and the lamb is the lamp thereof (Rev. 21:23; 22:5). From this also it is that David, and the kings after him, are called: Lamps of Israel (2 Sam. 21:17; 1 Kings 11:36; 15:4; 2 Kings 8:19); for the Lord in respect to his royalty was represented by David, likewise by the kings of Judah and Israel. (For the representation by “David,” see Arcana Coelestia, n. 1888, 9954; and by “kings,” n. 31, above.) The lamp stands that were seen were of gold; because “gold” signifies the good of love, and all that proceeds from the Lord is from Divine love; consequently the Divine of the Lord in the heavens is love to him and love towards the neighbor, which is charity (as may be seen in Heaven and Hell, n. 13–19). This is why the lamp stand here, as well as the lamp stand in the tabernacle, was of gold. 63. Verse 13. And in the midst of the seven lamp stands one like unto the son of man signifies the Lord, from whom is the All of heaven and of the church.

From this it can be seen why the Lord appeared “in the midst of seven lamp stands,” namely, because from him the all of heaven and the church proceeds; for it is the good of love and of faith that makes heaven and the church, and that this good is from the Divine is known in the Christian world, and as it is from the Divine, it is from the Lord, for the Lord is the God of heaven, and the Divine of the Lord makes heaven (see Heaven and Hell, n. 2–12; and that this is his Divine human, see n. 78–86). [2] That the son of man is the Lord in respect to the Divine human, and also in respect to Divine truth, because Divine truth proceeds from his Divine human, is evident from those passages in the Word where the son of man is mentioned. Thus in John: The multitude said to Jesus, How sayest thou, The son of man must be lifted up? Who is this son of man? Jesus answered them, Yet a little while is the light with you; walk while ye have the light, lest darkness overtake you. While ye have the light believe in the light, that ye may be sons of light (John 12:34–36). From these words it is clear that “the son of man” and “light” have a like signification; for when the people asked, Who is the son of man? the Lord answered that he was the light in which they should believe. (That “light” is Divine truth proceeding from the Lord’s Divine human, see Heaven and Hell, n. 126–140; and New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine, n. 49; thus also the son of man.) [3] In Luke: Blessed are ye when men shall hate you for the son of man’s sake (Luke 6:22)."

Because the evil deny these things, and those who deny also hate them, while the good acknowledge them, therefore it is said that the good are blessed. [4] In the same: The days will come when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the son of man, but ye shall not see it. Then they shall say to you, Lo here, or Lo there. Go not away, nor pursue after (Luke 17:22–23). “To desire [to see] one of the days of the son of man,” is to desire Divine truth, which is genuine truth, as to something thereof; the end of the church is here meant, when there will no longer be any faith, because there will be no charity, at which time all Divine truth will perish; and because Divine truth is signified by “the son of man,” it is said, “Then shall they say, Lo here, or lo there; pursue not after.” [5] In the same: When the son of man cometh, shall he find faith upon the earth? (Luke 18:8); which means that when Divine truth shall be revealed out of heaven it will not be believed. Here also, “the son of man” is the Lord in respect to Divine truth; the coming of the Lord is the revelation of Divine truth at the end of the church (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 3900, 4060). [6] In Matthew: As the lightning cometh forth from the east, and is seen even unto the west, so shall the coming of the son of man be. Then shall appear the sign of the son of man in heaven; and then shall all the tribes of the earth lament, and they shall see the son of man coming in the clouds of heaven, with power and glory (Matt. 24:27, 30)."

And in Luke: From henceforth shall the son of man be seated at the right hand of the power of God (Luke 22:69). “The son of man” is the Lord in respect to the Divine human, and in respect to Divine truth proceeding from him; “to sit at the right hand of power” means that he has omnipotence; its being said that they were now about to see this means that Divine truth was in its omnipotence when the Lord in the world had conquered the hells and reduced to order all things there and in the heavens, and that thus those who received him in faith and love could be saved (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 9715. That to “sit at the right hand” means omnipotence, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 3387, 4592, 4933, 7518, 8281, 9193; that all the power of good is by means of truth, n. 6344, 6423, 8304, 9327, 9410, 9639, 9643.

This he also teaches in Luke: But first must the son of man suffer, and be rejected of this generation (Luke 17:25). [11] In Jeremiah: No man shall dwell there; neither shall a son of man sojourn there (Jer. 49:18, 33). In the cities no man shall dwell, nor shall a son of man pass through them (Jer. 51:43). he who does not know the spiritual sense of the Word believes that by “cities” here are meant cities, and that by “man,” and “son of man,” are meant a man and a son; and that the cities were to be so desolated that no one should be in them, but it is the state of the church in respect to the doctrine of truth that is described by these words; for “cities” are the doctrinals of the church (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 402, 2449, 3216, 4492–4493); and “man” is its very truth conjoined with good (see n. 3134, 7716, 9007); therefore a “son of man” is truth. [12] As Divine truth proceeding from the Lord was signified by “the son of man,” therefore the prophets by whom it was revealed were called “sons of man” (as Daniel 8:17; and Ezekiel 2:1, 3, 6, 8; 3:1, 3–4, 10, 17, 25; 4:1, 16; 8:5–6, 8, 12, 15; 12:2, 3, 9, 18, 22, 27). As most things in the Word have also a contrary sense, so “son of man” has a contrary signification, which is the falsity opposite to truth. Thus in Isaiah: What art thou, that thou art afraid of man, that dies; and of the son of man, who shall be as grass (Isa. 51:12). And in David: Put not your trust in princes, in the son of man, with whom there is no salvation (Ps. 146:3)."

Clothed with a garment down to the foot signifies Divine truth proceeding from him. This is evident from the signification of “garments” as being truths that clothe good (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 1073, 2576, 5248, 5319, 5954, 9212, 9216, 9952, 10536). Here is only mentioned “a garment down to the foot,” which is a general covering; by which, as the Lord is treated of, all Divine truth in general is meant. Since the Lord is here described in respect to the Divine human, which is here the “Son of man seen in the midst of the lamp stands,” and it is said that he was “clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about at the paps with a golden girdle,” and afterwards that “his face shone as the sun in his power,” I wish to give an explanation of what is said in the Evangelists about the Lord when he was transfigured, where some similar expressions are used; and afterwards of what is said about the soldiers dividing his garments, and casting the lot upon his tunic. [2] Of the Lord’s transfiguration it is thus written: Jesus took Peter, James, and John, into a very high mountain, and he was transfigured before them; and his face did shine as the sun, and his garments became white as the light. And behold, there appeared to them Moses and Elijah speaking with him. And behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and behold, a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him (Matt. 17:1–5; Mark 9:2–8; Luke 9:28–36). The Lord took Peter, James, and John, because by them the church in respect to faith, charity, and the works of charity was represented; he took them “into a high mountain,” because “mountain” signifies heaven”; “his face did shine as the sun,” because “face” signifies the interiors, and it did shine as the sun because his interiors were Divine, for the “sun” is Divine love; “his garments became white as the light,” because “garments” signify Divine truth proceeding from him; the like is signified by “light.” “Moses and Elijah” appeared, because the two signify the Word,"

And because Divine truth is from him, and thence all truth of the church, it was said out of the cloud, “in whom I am well pleased, hear ye him.” [3] It was plainly the Divine human of the Lord that was thus seen, for the Divine itself cannot be seen by anyone, except through the Divine human. This the Lord also teaches in John: No man hath seen God at any time; the only-begotten son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath brought him forth to view (John 1:18). Ye have neither heard the voice of the Father at any time, nor seen his shape (John 5:37). (That such things are signified by these words in the Evangelists, can be seen in Arcana Coelestia where the particulars are made known, namely, that by “Peter,” “James,” and “John,” in the Word, are signified faith, charity, and the works of charity, n. 3750, and above, n. 8–9; by “high mountain” is signified heaven, n. 8327, 8805, 9420, 9422, 9434, 10608; by “face,” the interiors which are of the mind, n. 1999, 2434, 3527, 4066, 4796, 5102, 9306, 9546; and by “the face of the Lord,” mercy, peace, and every good, n. 222, 223, 5585, 9306, 9546, 9888; by “the sun,” Divine Love, n. 2495, 4060, 7083; and in Heaven and Hell, n. 116–125; by “garments,” when the Lord is treated of, Divine truth, n. 9212, 9216; and the like by “light,” n. 3195, 3222, 5400, 8644, 9399, 9548, 9684; and in Heaven and Hell, n. 126–140.

Now the tunic was without seam, woven from the top throughout. They said therefore one to another, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for whose it shall be; that the Scripture might be fulfilled which saith, They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture they did cast lots. These things therefore the soldiers did (John 19:23–24). [4] He who is not aware that in every particular of the Word there is an internal sense which is spiritual, cannot see any arcanum in these things; he knows only that the soldiers divided the garments and not the tunic; and beyond this he knows nothing; when not only in this fact is there a Divine arcanum, but also in every particular of what is recorded concerning the passion of the Lord. The arcanum in this fact is that the garments of the Lord signified Divine truth, thus the Word, because the Word is Divine truth; the “garments” that they divided, the Word in the letter, and the “tunic” the Word in the internal sense to “divide them” signifies to disperse and falsify; and “the soldiers” signify those that are of the church, who should fight in behalf of Divine truth. This is why it is said, “These things therefore the soldiers did.” From this it is clear that the meaning of these words in the spiritual sense is that the Jewish church dispersed the Divine truth which is in the sense of the letter, but could not disperse the Divine truth which is in the internal sense. That the “garments of the Lord” signified Divine truth, thus the Word, was shown above; that his “tunic” signified Divine truth, or the Word, in the internal sense, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 9826, 9942; that to “divide” is to disperse and separate from good and truth, thus to falsify, see n. 4424, 6360, 6361, 9094; that “the soldiers” signify those that are of the church, here of the Jewish church, who should fight in behalf of Divine truth is clear from the spiritual sense of “warfare” and of “war”; that “war” signifies spiritual combats, which are of truth against falsity, see n. 1659, 1664, 8295, 10455; it is therefore said of the Levites, whose function pertained to such things as are of the church, that"

And girt about at the paps with a golden girdle signifies Divine good likewise. This is evident from the signification of “being girt about at the paps with a girdle,” as being to be encompassed about the breast; “paps” and “girdle” are mentioned, because paps stand out from the breast, and a girdle encompasses. Divine good going forth from the Lord is here meant because this is signified by the “breast” in general and by the “paps” in particular. Good proceeding is meant because all garments signify things that proceed, for they are outside the body and clothe it; as things that proceed are also outside the body and encompass it. (That this is so can be seen from what is said in Heaven and Hell of the garments with which angels are clothed, n. 177–182; namely, that everyone is clothed with garments according to his affection for becoming intelligent and wise, and this affection is what proceeds from them; for there is a sphere that proceeds from every angel and spirit, which is a sphere of affection, and is called the sphere of his life, and their garments are according to this sphere. That this is so does not appear before their eyes, but yet they know that it is so. Of this sphere, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 2489, 4464, 5179, 7454, 8630.) [2] From this it can be seen that the “Lord’s garments” signify the proceeding Divine, which is Divine truth united to Divine good, which fills the universal heaven and enters into the interiors of the mind, and gives to him who receives it intelligence and wisdom. This is meant by being “clothed with white garments.” Because the proceeding Divine good is signified by “the girdle” with which the Lord was girded, therefore the girdle appeared golden, for “gold” signifies the good of love (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 113, 1551, 1552, 5658, 6914, 6917, 9510, 9874, 9881). The “paps” are mentioned instead of the breast, which was girt with the girdle, because “paps” signify spiritual love, and “breast” signifies the good itself of that love. This love is signified by “paps” in Isaiah:"

[3] That “breast” signifies the good of spiritual love is from correspondence with heaven; for the whole heaven corresponds to all things of man; the inmost or third heaven corresponding to the head; the middle or second to the breast; and the outmost or first to the feet. Because there is this correspondence, heaven is also called the greatest man. And as the inmost or third heaven corresponds to the head, by “head” is signified the good of celestial love, which is the good of love to the Lord; because that good rules and makes that heaven; and as the middle or second heaven corresponds to the breast, by “breast” is signified the good of spiritual love, which is the good of love to the neighbor, because that good rules and makes that heaven; and as the outmost or first heaven corresponds to the feet, by “feet” is signified the good of natural love from spiritual love, which is the good of faith; because that good rules and makes that heaven. From this it is clear why “paps” signify spiritual love, and the “breast” its good. (But these things may be better understood from what is shown in Heaven and Hell, especially in the following chapters: on the three heavens, n. 29–39; that the Divine of the Lord in the heavens is love to him and charity towards the neighbor, n. 13–19; that the universal heaven represents one man, n. 59–67; that there is a correspondence of heaven with all things of man, n. 87–102; and Arcana Coelestia, n. 4938, 4939, 10087. It may be permitted to cite from that work, by way of illustration, this further reason why the “breast” signifies the good of spiritual love, namely, that within the breast are the heart and lungs, and the “heart” from correspondence signifies celestial love, while the “lungs” signify spiritual love, but the lungs fill the breast. That there is this correspondence, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 3883–3896, 9280, 9300. What celestial love is, and what spiritual love, see Heaven and Hell, n. 23.)"

(That “white” [album] and “bright white” [candidum] mean what is pure, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 3301, 3993, 4007, 5319.) “Head,” in reference to the Lord, is the Divine in firsts, because the head is the highest part of man, and in it are his firsts, which are called the beginnings, from which are derived all things that have place in the body; for in the head are the understanding and the will, from which, as from their firsts or beginnings, flow the remaining things that relate to man’s outer life, such as speech and all actions.

[3] That a Nazarite should not shave his hair, because this, as is said, was the Nazariteship of God upon his head; and that when the days were accomplished he should shave it off and consecrate it, was for the reason that the Nazarite represented the Lord in firsts and in ultimates, and his Divine in ultimates was his human, which he made Divine even to the flesh and bones, which are ultimates. That he made it Divine even to the flesh and bones is evident from the fact that he left nothing in the sepulcher, and that: He said to the disciples that he had flesh and bones, which a spirit hath not (Luke 24:39–40). And when the Divine itself is Divine even in ultimates, then it governs all things from firsts by means of ultimates (as can be seen from what was shown above, n. 41; especially from what was cited from Arcana Coelestia, namely, that interior things flow in successively into exterior things, even into what is extreme or outmost, and there have existence and subsistence, n. 634, 6239, 6465, 9215, 9216; that they not only flow in successively, but also form what is simultaneous in the ultimate, in what order see n. 5897, 6451, 8603, 10099; that therefore all interior things are held together in connection from the first by means of the ultimate, n. 9828, and Heaven and Hell, n. 297; that from this the ultimate is more holy than the interiors, n. 9824; and therefore in ultimates there is strength and power, n. 9836). These then are the reasons why the Nazariteship was instituted. The Nazarite was finally to consecrate his hair by putting it into the fire of the altar, because it represented the Divine holiness, and the “fire of the altar” signified that holiness (n. 934, 6314, 6832). [4] From this it can be seen, moreover, why the strength of Samson was in his hair (Judges 16:13 to the end), for it is said that: He was a Nazarite from his mother’s womb (Judg. 13:7; 16:17)."

Likewise: With the Israelitish people to cut off the beard (which had a like signification) was disgraceful (2 Sam. 10:4, 5). The forty-two children were torn in pieces by the bears because they mocked Elisha, calling him bald-head, for the reason that Elijah and Elisha represented the Lord in respect to the Word, which is Divine truth, the sanctity and strength of which are in ultimates from firsts, as was said just above. Because “baldness” thus signified the deprivation of these, this took place. “Bears,” moreover signify truth in ultimates.

In David: God shall bruise the head of his enemies, the hairy scalp of him that goeth on in his guilt (Ps. 68:21). In these passages and in others, by “cutting off the hair of the head,” “shaving the beard,” and inducing baldness is signified to deprive of all truth and good; since he that is deprived of ultimates is also deprived of things prior, for prior things have existence and subsistence in ultimates, as was said above. Moreover, in the world of spirits there are seen some that are bald, and I have been told that they are such as have abused the Word, and have applied the sense of the letter, which is Divine truth in ultimates, to wicked purposes, and therefore have been deprived of all truth. These are most malignant. Many of them are of the Babylonish body. Angels, on the contrary, appear with becoming hair. 67. As white wool, as snow signifies in respect to good and truth therein. This is evident from the signification of “white wool” as being good in ultimates (of which presently); and from the signification of “snow,” as being truth in ultimates. “Snow” means truth in ultimates by reason of the water of which it is composed, and its whiteness and brightness. (That “water” signifies truth, see below, n, 71; and that “whiteness,” and “brightness” signify truth from the transparency of light, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 3301, 3993, 4007, 5319, 8459.) “White wool” signifies good in ultimates, because wool upon lambs and sheep has a signification like that of hair upon man; and “lambs,” and “sheep” signify good, “lambs”"

From this it is that the “hairs,” by which Divine truth in ultimates is signified, are said to be “white as white wool, and as snow.” So also of the Lord, when he was transfigured: His garments became glistening, exceeding white as snow, so as no fuller on earth can whiten them (Mark 9:3); and of the “ancient of days” in Daniel: I beheld till thrones were cast down, and the ancient of days did sit; his raiment was white as snow, and the hair of his head was8 white wool (Dan. 7:9). “Raiment” signifies the Divine in ultimates (see above, n. 64); and “the ancient of days,” the Lord from eternity. [2] Because “wool” signifies good in ultimates, good is sometimes described in the Word by “wool,” and truth by “linen” and by “snow,” as in Hosea: She said, I will go after my lovers, that give me my bread and my waters, my wool and my flax. Therefore will I return and take my corn in the time thereof, and I will pluck away my wool and my flax (Hos. 2:5, 9).

The Divine love itself is what thus appears. From this it is that in the Word “fire” and “flame” signify love (as can be seen from what is shown in Arcana Coelestia, namely, that in the Word “fire” signifies love in each sense, n. 934, 4906, 5215. That sacred and celestial fire is Divine love, and every affection which is of that love, see n. 934, 6314, 6832.

That love is the fire of life, and that life itself is actually therefrom, see n. 4906, 5071, 6032, 6314. That flame is truth from the good of the inmost heaven, and light truth from the good of the middle heaven, see n. 3222, 6832; the reason is, that light in the inmost heaven appears flaming, and in the middle heaven bright white, see n. 9570; and likewise in Heaven and Hell, n. 116–140). In reference to the Lord, “eyes” signify Divine providence, because, in reference to man, they signify understanding; and the Divine understanding, because it is infinite, is Divine providence.

[2] In reference to the Lord, “feet” signify the ultimate of Divine order, and this is the natural, because heaven is heaven from the Lord’s Divine human, and from this it is that heaven in the whole complex represents one man; and as there are three heavens, that the highest heaven represents the head, the middle heaven the body, and the lowest heaven the feet. The Divine that makes the highest heaven is called the celestial Divine, but the Divine that makes the middle heaven is called the spiritual Divine, and the Divine that makes the lowest heaven is called the natural Divine from the spiritual and celestial. This makes it evident why the Lord is here described in respect to his Divine human, which is the son of man seen in the midst of the lamp stands, not only as regards his garments, but also as to his head, breast, and feet. (That the son of man is the Lord as to his Divine human, see above, n. 63; and that the “lamp stands” are heaven, see n. 62. But since these things are arcana hitherto unknown in the world, and yet must be understood in order that the internal sense of this and the following parts of this prophetical book may be comprehended, the particulars have been explained specifically in Heaven and Hell; as that the Divine human of the Lord makes heaven, n. 7–12, 78–86 seq.; that on this account heaven in the whole complex represents one man, n. 59–77; that there are three heavens, and that the highest refers to the head, the middle to the body, and the lowest to the feet, n. 2940.) When this is understood it can be seen what is signified in the Word by “the feet of Jehovah” or “of the Lord,” namely, the ultimate of Divine order, or the natural; and since the external of the church, of worship, and of the Word is the ultimate of Divine order in the church, and is the natural, this is specifically signified by “the feet of Jehovah” or “of the Lord.” [3] Because of this signification of “the feet of Jehovah” or “of the Lord,” therefore when the Lord was seen as an angel by the prophets elsewhere, he appeared in like manner.

In like manner the cherubs, by which is meant the Lord in respect to providence and protection (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 9277, 9509, 9673), were seen by Ezekiel: Their feet sparkled like the brightness of polished brass (Ezek. 1:7). The Lord was seen in like manner as an angel, as described further on in Revelation: I saw an angel coming down out of heaven, arrayed with a cloud, and a rainbow was about his head, and his face was as the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire (Rev. 10:1). As the Lord appeared in this manner as to his feet, therefore under his feet there was seen by some of the sons of Israel: As it were a work of sapphire stone, and as it were the substance of heaven for clearness (Exod. 24:10). Their vision of the Lord was not as to the feet, but “under the feet,” because they were not in, but under, the external of the church, of worship, and of the Word (see New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine, n. 248).

Because “cloud” is the external of the Word, it is also the external of the church and of worship; for the church and worship are from the Word. “Clouds” are called “dust of his feet,” because those things that are in the sense of the letter of the Word, which is natural, appear scattered. 70. The feet are said to be “like unto burnished brass,” because burnished brass is polished brass, shining from something fiery; and “brass” in the Word signifies natural good.

All this was from the spiritual signification of these metals. [2] From this it can be known what is signified by the image seen in a dream by Nebuchadnezzar: The head of which was of gold, the breast and arms of silver, the belly and sides of brass, the legs of iron, and the feet partly of iron and partly of clay (Dan. 2:23, 33); namely, the state of the church in respect to good and truth, from its first time to its last; its last time was when the Lord came into the world.

[5] He who knows what “brass” signifies may also enter into the arcanum why it was commanded that a serpent of brass be set up for the people to look at, of which it is thus written in Moses: Jehovah sent serpents among the people, and they bit the people. And he said unto Moses, Make thee a serpent, and set it upon a standard, and it shall come to pass that everyone that is bitten, and looketh upon it, shall live. And Moses made a serpent of brass, and set it upon a standard; and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, and he looked unto the serpent of brass, he lived (Num. 21:6, 8–9). That this “serpent” signified the Lord, he himself teaches in John: As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the son of man be lifted up, that whosoever believeth in him may not perish, but may have everlasting life (John 3:14–15). By the “serpent” is signified that which is the ultimate of life with man, and is called the external sensual, which is the natural. Because this ultimate in the Lord was Divine, a serpent of brass was made among the sons of Israel, with whom all things were representative; and this signified that if they would look to the Divine human of the Lord they would live again, that is, if they would believe in him they would have eternal life, as the Lord himself also teaches.

(That knowledges are of the external or natural man, because they are in the light of the world, thus in ultimates, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 5212, and in general, New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine, n. 51.) As it is not yet known that “waters” in the Word signify the truths of faith and the knowledges of truth, I would like, since this signification may possibly appear remote, to show here briefly that this is what is meant in the Word by “waters.” This, moreover, is necessary, because without a knowledge of what “waters” signify, it cannot be known what baptism signifies, nor the “washings” in the Israelitish church so frequently referred to. “Waters” signify the truths of faith, as “bread” signifies the good of love. “Waters” and “bread” have this signification because things that pertain to spiritual nourishment are expressed in the sense of the letter by such things as belong to natural nourishment; for bread and water, which include in general all food and drink, nourish the body, while the truths of faith and the good of love nourish the soul. This also is from correspondence, for when “bread” and “water” are read of in the Word, angels, because they are spiritual, understand the things by which they are nourished, which are the goods of love and the truths of faith.

[4] I know that some will wonder why “waters” are mentioned in the Word, and not the truths of faith, since the Word is to teach man about his spiritual life; and since, if the expression the truths of faith had been used, instead of “waters,” man would have known that the waters of baptism and of washings contribute nothing to the purifying of man from evils and falsities. But it is to be known, that the Word in order to be Divine, and at the same time useful to heaven and the church, must be wholly natural in the letter, for if it were not natural in the letter there could be no conjunction of heaven with the church by means of it; for it would be like a house without a foundation, and like a soul without a body, for ultimates enclose all interiors, and are a foundation for them (see above, n. 41). Man also is in ultimates, and upon the church in him heaven has its foundations. For this reason the style of the Word is such as it is; and as a consequence, when man from the natural things that are in the sense of the letter of the Word thinks spiritually, he is conjoined with heaven, and in no other way could he be conjoined with it."

This is evident from the signification of “having in his right hand,” as being from him; for “hand” signifies power, thus it signifies whatever pertains to one, and so also whatever is from him. It is said “right hand,” because “right hand” signifies the power of god through truth. (That “hand” signifies power, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 875, 3091, 4931–4937, 6947, 10019; and consequently that it signifies whatever pertains to one, and so also whatever is from him, 9133, 10019, 10405; that the “right hand” signifies the power of good through truth, see n. 9604, 9736, 10061; and that “the right hand of Jehovah” signifies the Lord’s Divine power, thus omnipotence, see n. 3387, 4592, 4933, 7518, 7673, 8281, 9133, 10019.) This is evident also from the signification of “stars,” as being the knowledges of good and truth, of which more in what follows; and from the signification of “seven,” as being all (see above, n. 20, 24). [2] That “stars” signify the knowledges of good and truth, thus goods and truths, is from the appearance in the spiritual world; for there the Lord appears as a sun, and angels from afar off as stars. Angels appear thus from their reception of light from the Lord as a sun, thus from their reception of Divine truth, which is from the Lord, for this is the light of heaven. From this it is that it is said in Daniel: The intelligent shall shine as the brightness of the expanse; and they that justify many, as the stars for ever and ever (Dan. 12:3). The “intelligent” are they that are in truths, and “they that justify” are those that are in good (see Heaven and Hell, n. 346–348). [3] When it is known to any that the “sun” signifies the Lord in respect to Divine love, thus also Divine love from the Lord, and that “stars” signify the truths of the church and knowledges thereof, these can also know what is signified in the Word where it is said that “the sun shall be darkened,” and that “the stars shall not give light,” also that they “shall fall from heaven”; and also what “stars”"

In Isaiah: I will make the land a waste, and destroy the sinners thereof out of it; the stars of the heaven and the constellations thereof shall not shine forth with their light; the sun shall be darkened in his going forth, and the moon shall not make bright her light (Isa. 13:9–10). The vastation of the church is here treated of, which is when there is no good of love any more, nor any truths of faith. The “land” that shall be laid waste is the church; the “land” is the church (as may be seen above, n. 29). [4] In Ezekiel: When I shall extinguish thee I will cover the heavens, and will make the stars dark; I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not make her light to shine; all the luminaries of light will I make dark over thee, and I will set darkness upon the land (Ezek. 32:7–8). “Darkness upon the land” means falsities in the church. In Joel: The sun and the moon shall be darkened, and the stars withdraw their brightness (Joel 2:10–11; 3:15). In Matthew: In the consummation of the age, after the affliction of those days the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken (Matt. 24:29; Mark 13:24). In Daniel: From one of the horns of the he-goat went forth a horn, a little one, and it waxed exceeding great towards the south, and towards the east, and towards splendor; and it waxed great towards the host of the heavens; and some of the host and of the stars it cast down and trampled upon them.

This is evident also from the signification of “the long sword,” or the “sword,” as being truth combating; and as truth, when it combats, disperses falsities, therefore a “long sword” also signifies the dispersion of falsities. The long sword is called “two-edged and sharp,” because truth completely disperses.

Verse 17. And when I saw him signifies the presence of the Divine majesty. This is evident from the things that precede relating to the son of man, all of which are of the Divine majesty, as is clear from the explanation of them in the internal sense; as that “he was clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about at the paps with a golden girdle” signifying that Divine truth and Divine good proceed from him; that “his head and his hairs were white as white wool, as snow” signifying the Divine in firsts and in ultimates; that “his feet were like unto burnished brass, as if glowing in a furnace” signifying that his human, even in ultimates, is full of Divine love; that “his voice was as the voice of many waters” signifying that all Divine truth is from him; that “he had in his right hand seven stars” signifying that all goods and truths of heaven and the church are therefrom; that “out of his mouth a sharp two-edged sword went forth” signifying that by him all falsities are dispersed; that “his face was as the sun shineth in his power” signifying that from his Divine love were all things of heaven. It is clear that these things are Divine, and that they appeared full of Divine majesty. That to “see” signifies here the presence, now most interior, of these things is evident from this, that it was also said before that John saw them (verse 12), and according to that seeing also they were described; and now again it is said “I saw him,” and on account of this seeing he fell at his feet as dead; therefore it is that by “seeing” is here signified the presence of the Divine majesty. This presence came to John, when he saw “his face as the sun in his power,” for from this he was illustrated and filled with awe, in the presence of the Divine; for all Divine light is from the Lord as a sun, and Divine light passes into the interiors; from this comes such presence and such filling with awe (as can be seen in Heaven and Hell, on the Lord as a sun, n. 116–125; on light and heat therefrom in heaven, n. 126–140; and on turning to him, n. 17, 123, 144, 145, 151, 255, 272, 510, 548, 561).

That this is so is well known in the spiritual world. It is clear, therefore, that by “I saw him,” stated a second time, is signified the presence of the Divine majesty. 77. And I fell at his feet signifies adoration from humiliation of heart in presence of the Divine. This is evident from the signification of “falling at the feet,” as being adoration from humiliation. Humiliation of heart is meant, because humiliation that springs from the heart in presence of the Divine produces that prostration. All affections, whatsoever they are, have corresponding gestures in the body. Into these gestures the body is borne and falls as of itself, when man is interiorly in the affection. Humiliation before a man produces a bowing down, according to the estimation of him; but in presence of the Divine it produces total prostration, especially when man thinks that the Divine in respect to power and wisdom is everything, and man in comparison is nothing, or that from the Divine is all good and from man nothing but evil. When man is in this acknowledgment from the heart he comes as it were out of himself, and thence falls upon his face, and when he is thus out of himself he also is removed from the proprium [what is his own], which in itself is wholly evil; when this is removed, the Divine fills him and raises him up; not that the Divine desires such humiliation on its account, but because evil is then removed, and so far as evil is removed with man so far the Divine flows in; for evil alone stands in the way. (An example of such humiliation may be seen in Earths in the Universe, n. 91.) Man’s state when the Divine presence with him removes proprium, and afterwards infills him is thus described in this verse: “When I saw him I fell at his feet as dead; and he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not.” This state is more fully described in Daniel:"

I alone saw the vision; but the men that were with me saw it not; but great fear fell upon them, and they fled. And there remained no strength in me; and I came into a deep sleep, and my face upon the ground. But lo, a hand touched me, and set me upon my knees and upon the palms of my hands, and he said, Fear not (Dan. 10:5–12). This state is also described in Ezekiel, when he saw the cherubs, by which is signified the Lord in respect to providence: When I saw the glory of Jehovah, I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that spoke. And he said unto me, son of man, stand upon thy feet, that I may speak to thee. And the spirit entered into me when he spoke unto me, and set me upon my feet, and I heard him that spoke unto me (Ezek. 1:28; 2:1–2; 3:24). Likewise also, when Jesus was transfigured before Peter, James, and John, of which it is thus written in Matthew: While Peter was yet speaking, beho ld, a bright cloud overshadowed them; and behold, a voice out of the cloud saying, This is my beloved son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him. And when the disciples heard these things they fell on their face, and were sore afraid. And Jesus came and touched them, and said, Arise, be not afraid. And when they had lifted up their eyes they saw no one save Jesus only (Matt. 17:5–8). From this it is apparent of what nature is the presence of the Divine human of the Lord with man, when man is in a state of humiliation of heart, namely, that he falls upon his face, and by the touch of the Lord’s hand is raised upon his feet. It was plainly the presence of the Lord in respect to the Divine human; since it was the “son of man” who was in the midst of the lamp stands that appeared in this way before John; and the “son of man” is the Lord as to the Divine human, see above (n. 63). It was similar with the disciples when the Lord was transfigured; it is therefore also said that “when they lifted up their eyes they saw no one save Jesus only.” That it was also the Lord as to the Divine human who was seen by Daniel and Ezekiel is evident from the words of the Lord himself, that:"

As dead signifies failure of self-life. This is evident from the signification of “as dead,” in reference to the Divine presence with man, as meaning the failure of self-life; for man’s self-life is that into which he is born, which is in itself nothing but evil, for it is altogether inverted, for it has regard to itself and the world only, and therefore turns itself back away from God and from heaven. The life that is not man’s self-life is that into which he is led when he is being regenerated by the Lord; and when he comes into that life he regards God and heaven in the first place, and self and the world in the second. That life flows in with man when the Lord is present; consequently so far as that life flows in, so far there is effected a turning of the life. This turning, when effected suddenly, causes man to appear to himself as dead; thence it is that by “as dead” is here signified the failure of self-life. But these two states of life cannot be so described as to be apprehended. Moreover, they are not the same with a man and with a spirit, and they are wholly different with the evil and with the good. Man cannot live with the body in the presence of the Divine; those who do live are encompassed by an angelic column, which moderates the Divine influx; for the body of every man is nonreceptive of the Divine, consequently it dies and is cast off. That man cannot live with the body in the presence of the Divine can be seen from the words of the Lord to Moses: Thou canst not see my faces; for man shall not see me and live (Exod. 33:20); Moses, therefore, because he desired to see, was placed in a cleft of a rock and was covered until the Lord had passed by.

And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the mount, or touch the extremity of it; whosoever toucheth the mount dying he shall die. And because terror seized upon them, they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us and we will hear; but let not God speak with us lest perchance we die (Exod. 19:11–12; 20:19). (That by “Mount Sinai” is signified heaven, where the Lord is, and that by “touching” is signified to communicate, to transfer, and to receive, and for this reason it was forbidden to touch the extremity of that mountain, see in the explanation of those chapters in Arcana Coelestia.) Jehovah has been seen by many, as recorded in the Word, but this was because they were encompassed at the time by a column of spirits, and thus were preserved, as was said above. In this way the Lord has also been seen at different times by me. But the state of spirits in the Divine presence is different from the state of men; spirits cannot die, consequently if they are evil they die a spiritual death in the Divine presence, the nature of which will be spoken of presently; but those who are good are conveyed into societies, where the sphere of the Divine presence is tempered and accommodated to reception. On account of this there are three heavens, and in each heaven many societies, and those who are in the higher heavens are nearer to the Lord, and those who are in the lower are more remote from him (see Heaven and Hell, n. 20–28, 29–40, 41–50, 206–209). What the spiritual death is that evil spirits die in the Divine presence, shall be briefly stated. Spiritual death is a turning away and removal from the Lord. When evil spirits, however, who have not yet been vastated, that is, have not yet become fixed in their ruling love, enter any angelic society, then because the Divine of the Lord is there present they are direfully tormented, and not only turn away but even cast themselves down into the depths, where no light from heaven enters; some into dark"

This turning away and removal from the Lord is what is called spiritual death; and with such the spiritual of heaven is dead. 79. And he laid his right hand upon me signifies life from him. This is evident from the signification of “right hand,” as being, in reference to the Lord, life from him (see above, n. 72). It signifies life from him, because it immediately follows the words, “I fell at his feet as dead”; and moreover, “to touch with the hand” signifies to communicate and transfer to another what pertains to oneself, and also to receive from another. To communicate and transfer to another what pertains to oneself, in reference to the Lord, as here, is to communicate and transfer life such as those have who are in a state of illumination and who see and hear such things as are in heaven. This also took place with John, for he was in such illumination when he saw and heard the things that are described in Revelation. “To touch with the hand” is to communicate and transfer to another, because the whole power of man is transferred from the body into the hands; consequently what the mind wills that the body should do, that the arms and hands do (from this it is that by “arms” and “hands” in the Word is signified power, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 878, 3091, 4931–4937, 6947, 7673, 10019). But this power is natural power, and communication thereby is an exertion of the bodily forces; but spiritual power is to will the good of another, and to will to convey to another as far as possible what is with oneself. This power is what “hand” in the spiritual sense signifies, and its communication and transference are signified by “touching with the hand.” From this it can be seen what is signified by this, that the Lord, who is here called the “Son of man,” laid his right hand upon John, when John lay as dead, namely, that he communicated and transferred to him life from himself (see above). “To touch,” and “to touch with the hand,” has a similar signification in many passages in the Word, as in the following.

As all things among the sons of Israel were representative and significative of spiritual things, so also was touch; wherefore those who touched what was holy were sanctified, and those who touched what was unclean were polluted; for “touch” signified communication and transference to another, and reception from another, as can be seen from the following passages in Moses: Whosoever shall touch the tent of meeting; the ark of the testimony; the table, and all the vessels thereof; the lamp stand and the vessels thereof; the altar of incense; the altar of burnt offering, and all the vessels thereof, and the laver and the base thereof, shall be holy (Exod. 30:26–29).

And whosoever in the open field toucheth one that is slain with a sword, or the bone of a man, or a grave, shall be unclean seven days. He that toucheth the waters of separation shall be unclean until even. And whatsoever the unclean person toucheth shall become unclean, and the soul that toucheth it shall be unclean until even (Num. 19:11, 13, 16, 21–22). He that toucheth unclean beasts and unclean reptiles shall be unclean. Everything upon which they shall fall shall be unclean, whether it be a vessel of wood, raiment, water, an earthen vessel, food, drink, an oven (but not a fountain, pit, or receptacle of water) shall be unclean (Lev. 11:31–36, besides other places, as Lev. 5:2, 3; 7:21; 11:37, 38; 15:1 to the end; 22:4; Num. 16:26; Isa. 52:11; Lam. 4:14, 15; Hos. 4:2, 3; Hag. 2:12, 13, 14). 80. Saying unto me, Fear not signifies renewal of life. This is evident from the series of things in the internal sense. For John lay as dead, and the Lord, seen as the son of man, laid his right hand upon him, and said to him, “Fear not.” His “lying as dead” signified failure of his self-life; the Lord’s “laying his right hand upon him” signified life from him; therefore his saying to him “Fear not” signified renewal of life; for all who come suddenly from self-life into any spiritual life are at first afraid, but their life is renewed by the Lord. This renewal is effected in this way that the Divine presence, and fear on account of it, are accommodated to reception. The Lord is present, indeed, with all in the universe, but more nearly or remotely according to the reception of good by means of truths with them from him. For good is that in which the Lord is present with angel, spirit, and man; therefore the extent and quality of good from the Lord with them are what determine the extent and quality of his presence; if the presence goes beyond this, there is anguish and tremor; but by accommodation to reception there is renewal of life (as can be seen from what has just been said and shown above, n. 78). This renewal is what is signified by “Fear not”; also in other places, where it is said by the Lord or by the angel of the Lord when seen:"

Renewal of life, that comes by accommodation to reception, appears in the spiritual world, when it is presented to view, as a cloud. All societies there are encompassed by such a cloud, denser or rarer according to reception. (That angels are encompassed by a thin correspondent cloud, lest they should be hurt by a nearer influx of the Divine of the Lord, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 6849. What “clouds” are in the spiritual world, and therefore in the spiritual sense, see above, n. 36.) 81. I am the first and the last signifies who governs all things from firsts by means of ultimates, thus all things of heaven. This is evident from the explanation given above (n. 41). 82. Verse 18. And the living one signifies who is from eternity. This is evident from this, that he who is from eternity is the only living one, and that all others, who are not from eternity, have been created by him, and thus made recipients of life from him. Therefore he only who is from eternity has life in himself, and no one besides him. That the Lord, in respect both to the Divine and to the human, has life in himself is evident from what is said in John: In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and God was the Word. In him was life, and the life was the light of men. And the Word became flesh, and dwelt in us (John 1:2–4, 14). That the Lord is here meant by the “Word” is clear, for it is said, “the Word became flesh, and dwelt in us.” In the same: As the Father hath life in himself, even so gave he to the son to have life in himself (John 5:26). Jesus said, I am the resurrection and the life (John 11:25). Jesus said, I am the way, the truth, and the life (John 14:6)."

But this belief is a belief in what is false (see Heaven and Hell, n. 9). 83. And I became dead signifies that he was rejected. This is evident from this, that the Lord is said to be “dead” when faith in him and love towards him are no more; for with those who are in love towards him and faith in him the Lord lives, but with those who are not in love and in faith toward him he does not live. With such he is said to be “dead” because he is rejected. This is what is here meant in the internal sense by the words “I became dead”; but in the sense of the letter it is meant that he was crucified. The Lord’s being crucified has a like signification in the internal sense, namely, that he was rejected and treated thus by the Jews; for the Lord, when he was in the world, was Divine truth itself, and as Divine truth was altogether rejected by the Jews, therefore the Lord, who was Divine truth, suffered himself to be crucified. Such things are signified by all that is related in the Evangelists concerning the Lord’s passion; the particulars, even to every minutest particular, involve this. Whenever, therefore, the Lord speaks of his passion he calls himself the son of man, that is, Divine truth (see above, n. 63). That Divine truth was altogether rejected by the Jews is well known; for they accepted nothing that the Lord said, and not even that he was the son of God. From this it may be known how those things that the Lord said to the disciples about the Jews’ rejection of him are to be understood. Thus in Luke: The son of man must suffer many things, and be repudiated by the elders and chief priests and scribes (Luke 9:22). The son of man must suffer many things, and be repudiated by this generation (Luke 17:25). In Mark: It is written of the son of man, that he should suffer many things and be set at naught (Mark 9:12)."

For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and shamefully entreated, and spit upon; and after they have scourged him, they shall put him to death; but the third day he shall rise again (Luke 18:31–33). The way in which the Jews treated Divine truth, which was from the Word, is signified by these particulars. “Jerusalem” here is the Jewish church; “to be delivered unto the Gentiles, to be mocked, to be shamefully entreated, to be spit upon, to be scourged, to be put to death,” are the wicked ways in which the Jews treated Divine truth; and as the Lord was Divine truth itself, because he was the Word (John 1:14), and as it was foretold in the prophets that Divine truth would be so dealt with in the end of the church, therefore it is said, “that all things may be accomplished that have been foretold through the prophets concerning the son of man.” So elsewhere in the same gospel: These are the words which I spoke unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must needs be fulfilled which are written in the law of Moses, and in the Prophets, and in the Psalms, concerning me (Luke 24:44). That all things were accomplished when Jesus was crucified he himself said, when he was upon the cross: Jesus, knowing that all things were accomplished, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, said, I thirst (John 19:28). he then said, “I thirst,” because he longed for a new church that would acknowledge him. (That to “thirst,” in the spiritual sense signifies to long for, and that it is predicated of the truths of the church, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 4958, 4976, 8568.)

At last upon the bird of abominations shall be desolation, and even to the consummation and decision it shall drop upon the devastation (Dan. 9:26–27). “Desolation” and “vastation” signify repudiation and rejection of Divine truth with those that are of the church (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 5360, 5376). That Divine truth, which is the Word, was so repudiated by the Jews is also meant by these words in Matthew: I say unto you that Elias is come already, and they have not acknowledged him, but have done unto him whatsoever they listed. Even so shall the son of man suffer of them (Matt. 17:12). By “Elias” the Word is signified (see Arcana Coelestia, preface to chapter 18 of Genesis, and in n. 2762, 5247), and also by “John the Baptist”; therefore he was called “Elias” (n. 7643, 9372). From this it can be seen what is signified by “Elias has come,” and that “they have done to him whatsoever they listed,” and that “the son of man is to suffer of them.” How the Jews explained and thus rejected the Word is clear from many passages in the Gospels, where the Lord makes this manifest. From this it can now be seen that “I became dead” signifies that he was rejected. Moreover, that the Lord, by the passion of the cross, also glorified his human, that is, made it Divine, see New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine, n. 294, 295, 302, 305. 84. And behold I am alive unto the ages of the ages signifies that eternal life is from him. This is evident from the signification of “I am alive,” which means to be from eternity, and that in him alone is life from himself (on which see above, n. 82); but here as being life in others, and his life in others is eternal life. For it is said just before that he “became dead,” which signifies that he was rejected, because not received in faith and love; here, therefore, “I am alive” signifies that he is received by those who are in his life, which life is in faith and love with man, and that life is eternal life. That “unto the ages of the ages” signifies to eternity is clear without explanation. That the life of the Lord is a life of faith in him and"

He that believeth on the son hath eternal life; but he that believeth not on the son shall not see life (John 3:14–16, 36). The water that I shall give shall become in him a fountain of water, springing up unto eternal life (John 4:10–11, 14). Water is the truth of faith (see above, n. 71). Everyone that beholdeth the son, and believeth on him, hath eternal life. The words that I speak unto you are spirit and are life (John 66:40, 63). The “words” that the Lord speaks are also the truths of faith. In the same: I am the resurrection and the life; he that believeth in me, though he die, yet shall he live (John 11:25–26). Work for the food which abideth unto eternal life, which the son of man giveth (John 6:27). The “food” which the Lord gives is also the truth and good of faith, because spiritual food is meant (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 3114, 4459, 4792, 5147, 5293, 5340, 5342, 5410, 5426, 8562, 9003). It was said that the life of the Lord is in faith in him and love to him with man; this is because everything of faith and love is from him, and that which is from him is also himself, for it is his proceeding Divine, which is called “the spirit of truth” and “the Holy Spirit”; and as the Lord is therein, and it is himself, therefore it is said that they should abide in the Lord, which means in faith in him and love to him, from him; as in John: Jesus said, Abide in me, and I in you.

From this it may be known what is meant by these words in John: Ye see me; because I live ye shall live also (John 14:19). (That to “see” the Lord is to believe in him, see above, n. 14, 25, 37; and that “to have faith,” or “to believe” in the Lord, is to be in love and charity, see Last Judgment, n. 33–39; and New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine, n. 108–142.) 85. Amen signifies Divine confirmation, as may be seen above (n. 34). 86. And I have the keys of hell and of death signifies that he has power to save. This is evident from the signification of “keys,” as being the power to open and shut (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 9410); and from the signification of “hell,” as being evils, for all evils are from hell and belong to hell; and from the signification of “death,” as being damnation, which is also called spiritual death (see n. 5407, 6119, 9008). “To have the keys of hell and of death” means also the power to save, because the Lord alone removes the hells with man and thereby damnation; and when the hells are removed man is saved, for in their place heaven and eternal life flows in; for the Lord is constantly present with man, and desires to fill him with heaven, but evils stand in the way of its being received; so far, therefore, as the hells are removed, that is, so far as man refrains from evils, so far the Lord with heaven flows in. The Lord here says that he “has the keys of hell and of death,” because it is said immediately before that he is “alive unto the ages of the ages,” by which is meant that from him is eternal life; and so far as the Lord is received in faith and in love, so far he is in man; and so far as he is in man so far he removes evils, thus the hells and eternal death.

If he thinks and wills evil it is from hell, but if he thinks and wills good it is from heaven. There is no thought and will in man from any other source. The man who supposes that he thinks and wills from himself is not aware of this; but I can assert from all experience on this subject that every thing that a man thinks and wills is either from one or the other of these sources. For this reason, moreover, the man who thinks and wills evil is actually in hell; and where one actually is while he lives in the world thither will he come after death. He can come into no other place because man’s spirit is formed and composed of those things that he thinks and wills. When, therefore, he thinks and wills evil, the whole man is formed and composed of evil, so that he is his own evil in form. From this it is that infernal spirits are altogether images of their own evil, and are monstrosities, horrible according to the kind of evil. Furthermore, the only means whereby a spirit can be formed and constituted for heaven is receiving the Lord in faith and love; for the Lord alone, by his presence in faith and love with man, removes evils, and forms man into an image of heaven, which is an angel. From this it can be seen what is signified by “having the keys of hell and of death.” The word “keys” is used because all the hells are closed up, and are opened only when evil spirits are cast into them, and when any are taken out of them, which occurs when evils increase with men. The openings that are then made are called “gates,” and as they are called “gates,” so also “keys” are mentioned, and these signify the power to open and to shut, since the opening and shutting of gates is effected by means of keys. The keys given to Peter (Matthew 16:18, 19) have a like signification; for by “Peter” is there signified truth from the good which is from the Lord, thus it is meant that the Lord alone, from whom is all the truth of faith and the good of love, has that power (see Last Judgment, n. 57). 87.

It is said here, “which thou sawest,” and “which are,” and “which are to be,” because above it was said in respect to the Lord, “who is, and who was, and who is to come.” What was there treated of was the Lord himself; but here things Divine from the Lord with man are treated of, as can be seen from what precedes and from what follows in the series. 88. Verse 20. The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand signifies revelation concerning goods and truths, which are all from him. This is evident from the signification of “mystery,” as being what lies concealed in the vision that John had, but here that vision revealed, since in what now follows it is told what is meant by the “seven stars” and by the “seven lamp stands.” This is evident also from the signification of the “seven stars,” as being the knowledges of all things of good and truth, and thence all goods and truths (see above, n. 72); and from the signification of “in my right hand,” as meaning, in reference to the Lord, what is from him (see also, n. 72). From this it is clear that by “the mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest” is signified the revelation of goods and truths, which are all from him. 89.

This is evident from the signification of the “seven stars,” as being goods and truths, all from the Lord (see above, n. 72); also from the signification of “angels,” as being those in the heavens who are in like correspondent good and truth with those in the church (of which more in what follows); also from the signification of “seven churches,” as being all those who are in truths from good, or in faith from charity, thus all who are of the church (see above, n. 20). From this taken together, it follows as a conclusion that by “the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches” are signified all who receive goods and truths from the Lord. By “angels” are here signified those who in heaven are in like correspondent good and truth with those in the church, because the universal heaven is divided into societies, and the societies are arranged according to the affections of good and truth in general and in particular. These societies correspond to those on earth who are in like affections of good and truth. All these societies are called “angels,” and each one is called an “angel”; and a society also when viewed from a distance, and when so presented as to be seen as a one, appears as a single angel (see Heaven and Hell, n. 62, 68–72). Moreover, there is a complete correspondence of heaven with the church, or of the angels of heaven with the men of the church; through this correspondence heaven makes a one with the church. From this it is clear what is here signified by the “angels of the seven churches,” and in the following chapter by the “angel” of each church, where it is said, “Write to the angel of the Ephesian church,” “to the angel of the church of the Smyrneans,” “to the angel of the Pergmean church,” “to the angel of the church of Thyatira,” “to the angel of the church in Sardis,” “to the angel of the Philadelphian church,” and “to the angel of the Laodicean church”; the command evidently was to write, not to angels but to churches, that is, to those who are in such good and truth from the Lord and who are described by each church (of whom we shall treat"

From this it is clear that by the “seven lamp stands are the seven churches” all who will be in the new heaven and in the new church are signified. All things in Revelation have regard to that which is signified by the “seven golden lamp stands,” that is, to the new heaven and the new church, as to their end and conclusion; consequently, these are treated of in the final chapters. The remaining things that come between are such things as stand in the way, and are to be removed, as what is said of the “dragon” and of the “beasts of Babylon.” When these no longer oppose, or when they are removed, the new heaven and the new church come forth and are manifest."

In a word, there is correspondence when man has becomes spiritual, and man becomes spiritual when he acknowledges the Divine and especially the Lord, and loves to live according to the precepts in the Word, for when he does this he is conjoined with heaven; and then the spiritual corresponds with the natural which is with him. I am aware that to many these things may seem to exceed their comprehension; but the reason is that it is not the delight of their love to know them; if it were the delight of their love, not only would they perceive them clearly, but they would also be eager to know much more of such things; for a man desires what he loves, and what he loves is his delight; moreover, whatever is loved enters both with joy and with light into the idea of the mind. 93. The angel of the Ephesian church is the first here written to; and by the angel of that church all those in the church are meant who are in the knowledges of truth and good, thus in the knowledges of such things as are of heaven and of the church, and who still are not, or not yet, in a life according to them. By these knowledges are especially meant doctrinals; but doctrinals alone, or the knowledges of truth and good alone, do not make a man spiritual, but a life according to them; for doctrinals or knowledges without a life according to them abide only in the memory and thence in the thought, and all things that abide there only, abide in"

That this is so anyone can see from this alone, that if anyone knows all the laws of moral and civil life, and does not live according to them, he still is not a moral and civil man; he may indeed talk about them more learnedly than others, but still he is rejected. It is the same with one who knows the ten precepts of the Decalogue, so as to be able even to explain and discourse about them with intelligence, and yet does not live according to them. Those, therefore, within the church who are in the knowledges of such things as pertain to the church, that is, who are in knowledges of truth and good from the Word, but are not, or not yet, in a life according to them, are here first treated of, and these are described by the things written to the angel of the Ephesian church.

But I have against thee that thou hast left thy first charity. Be mindful therefore of whence thou hast fallen, and repent, and do the first works; but if not I will come unto thee quickly, and will move thy lamp stand out of its place, except thou repent.

To the angel of the Ephesian church write, signifies for remembrance to those within the church who are in knowledges of truth and good from the Word. This is evident from the signification of “writing,” as being for remembrance (Arcana Coelestia n. 8620). It means to those within the church who are in the knowledges of truth and good from the Word, because these are meant by the “angel of the Ephesian church.” That these are meant is evident from the things written to the angel of that church. What is meant by the angel of each church can be known only from the internal sense of the things written to each church. It is said, “from the internal sense,” since all things in Revelation are prophetic, and things prophetic can be explained only by the internal sense. Who that reads the Prophets does not see that there are arcana therein that are more deeply hidden than the plain meaning of the letter? And since these arcana cannot be seen by the merely natural man, those who account the Word holy pass those things by that they do not understand, saying that there is a hidden meaning therein that is unknown to them, and that some call mystical. That this is the spiritual of the Word is known by some, because they think of the Word as being in its bosom spiritual for the reason that it is Divine. Nevertheless, it has been unknown heretofore that this is the spiritual sense of the Word, and that the Word is understood in this sense by angels, and that by means of this sense there is conjunction of heaven with the man of the church (see Heaven and Hell, n. 303–310). Those who are in the knowledges of truth and good from the Word are meant by the “angel of the Ephesian church,” because by the knowledges of truth and good are meant the doctrinals of the church, and only from the Word can doctrinals be obtained. Why it is said, “To the angel of the church, write,” and not, To the church, may be seen above (n. 92). 96. These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, signifies from whom are all the knowledges of good and truth. This is evident from the signification of “seven stars,” as meaning all the knowledges of good and truth (see above, n. 72); and from the signification of “right hand,” as being, in reference to the Lord, what is from him (see above, n. 72, 79); therefore by these words, “that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand,” is"

It is said that he saith this “who holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, and walketh in the midst of the [seven] golden lamp stands,” because by “stars” are signified the knowledges of good and truth, and by “golden lamp stands” the new heaven and the new church. There is thus prefixed to each description of a church a Divine characteristic that indicates the subject treated of (as to the descriptions of the churches that follow, verses 8, 12, 18; chap. 3:1, 7, 14). It is so prefixed because everything of the church is from the Lord. From this it is clear also why the Lord, in respect to his Divine human, is described in the first chapter by the representatives that were seen by John, namely, that from these might be taken what was to be prefixed to the description of each church, for a testimony and a memorial that everything of the church is from the Lord, and indeed from his Divine human; for from this all the good of love proceeds and every truth of faith, and these constitute the church. What immediately proceeds from his Divine itself does not reach man, because his Divine itself is invisible and therefore does not fall within the thought, and what does not fall within the thought does not fall within the faith; for everything that is of faith must be thought. That the son of man, who is described (in chap. 1) by the representatives seen by John, is the Lord in respect to the Divine human, and Divine truth proceeding therefrom, see above (n. 63). The knowledges of truth and good are here treated of first, because they are the first things of the church; for no one can be initiated into faith and charity, which constitute the church, except by means of knowledges from the Word that pertain to the church (see what is appended to n. 356 of Heaven and Hell from Arcana Coelestia). 97. He that walketh in the midst of the seven golden lamp stands, signifies from whom is life to all in the new heaven and in the new church.

From this it is clear that the Lord was seen “in the midst of the lamp stands,” because “midst” signifies inmost; “lamp stands” signify heaven and the church, and"

By this, therefore, it was represented that all the life of faith and of love in heaven and in the church is from him (see above, n. 84). (That “midst” denotes the inmost and the center from which, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 1074, 2940, 2973, 7777. That the Lord is the common center from whom is all direction and determination in heaven, see Heaven and Hell, n. 123–124. That the extension of the light of heaven, which is Divine truth proceeding from the Lord, from which angels have intelligence and wisdom, is effected also from the midst into those who are round about, see the same, n. 43, 50, 189.) That “walking” signifies living, and in reference to the Lord, life itself, is from appearances in the spiritual world, where all walk according to their life, the evil in no other ways than those that lead to hell, but the good in no other ways than those that lead to heaven; consequently all spirits are known there from the ways wherein they are walking. Moreover, ways actually appear there; but to the evil, the ways towards hell only, and to the good, the ways towards heaven only; and thus everyone is brought to his own society. From this it is that “walking” signifies living. (Of these ways, and walking therein, in the spiritual world, see what is shown in Heaven and Hell, n. 195, 479, 534, 590; and in Last Judgment, n. 48.) That in the Word “ways” signify truths or falsities, and “walking” signifies living, may be seen from many passages therein; I will cite only a few here by way of confirmation. In Isaiah: We have sinned against Jehovah; they would not walk in his ways, neither have they heard his law (Isa. 42:24). In Moses: If ye shall keep the commandments, by loving Jehovah your God, by walking in all his ways (Deut. 11:22). Thou shalt keep all this commandment to do it, by loving Jehovah thy God, and walking in his ways all the days (Deut. 19:9; 26:17)."

From these passages it can be seen that “walking,” in the spiritual sense, signifies living; and as it signifies living, so in reference to the Lord, as in this passage, it signifies life itself, for the Lord is life itself, and the rest are recipients of life from him (see above, n. 82, 84). 98.

This is why those external things here mentioned, “works,” “toil,” and “endurance,” signify willing, thinking, and consequent doing, or what is the same, loving, believing, and consequent presenting in act. But still these things are not comprehensible, unless it is also known that man has two faculties, called will and understanding, and that these two faculties are called by the one term “mind”; also that man has an internal and an external—an internal in the light of the spiritual world, and an external in the light of the natural world. (The will and the understanding are treated of in Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, n. 28–35; and the internal and the external man, n. 36–52.) When this is understood, it may be known that by “works,” in the spiritual sense, is meant everything that man wills and loves, and by “toil” everything that man thinks or believes, and by “endurance” everything that man does from these. [2] But leaving these matters, as being, perhaps, too little known about and therefore too obscure to be clearly apprehended, let us advance to this point only, that by “works,” in the spiritual sense, are meant all things that are of man’s will or love; and this, for the reason that in what follows as to the seven churches, it is everywhere said first, “I know thy works”; as in these verses: To the angel of the church of the Smyrneans write: These things saith the first and the last, I know thy works, and affliction, and poverty (Rev. 2:8–9); To the angel of the church in Pergamum write: These things saith he that hath the two-edged sword, I know thy works, and where thou dwellest (Rev. 2:12–13); To the angel of the church in Thyatira write: These things saith the son of God, I know thy works and charity (Rev. 2:18–19); To the angel of the church in Sardis write: These things saith he that hath the seven spirits of God, I know thy works, that thou art said to live (Rev. 3:1);"

[3] As it is here said everywhere, “I know thy works,” it is clear that “works” signify, in general, all things of the church; and as all things of the church have reference to love and faith, therefore these are what are meant in the spiritual sense by “works.” These are meant in the spiritual sense by “works,” because every work or deed or act, that to appearance is done from the body, is not done from the body, but is done by means of the body from man’s will and thought, for not a particle of the body moves itself except from the will and thought. From this it is that “works” signify, not the things that appear in outward form, but the things of will and thought. That this is so is known to everyone who reflects. Who that is wise regards a man from his deeds alone, and not from his will? If the will is good he loves the deeds; but if the will is evil he does not love the deeds. He sees the deeds also, but interprets them according to the intention of the will. He who is spiritual attends still less to the deeds, but explores the will; for the reason already given, that deeds in themselves are nothing, but all that they are is from the will, for deeds are the will in act. It is said “will,” but in the spiritual sense love is meant, for a man wills what he loves, and he loves what he wills. Man’s will is only the receptacle of his love. (See what is said and shown in Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, on that faculty of man, n. 28–35; and in Heaven and Hell, n. 358, 470–484.) [4] Because “works” or deeds in the Word signify specifically the things that proceed from man’s love or will, it is often said in the Word that a man shall be judged and it shall be rendered unto him according to his works; and the meaning is according to works in the internal form, not in the external; as in the following passages: The son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels, and then shall he render unto everyone according to his works (Matt. 16:27)."

Jesus answered, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom [the Father] hath sent (John 6:28, 29). The night cometh, when no man can work (John 9:4). “Night” signifies the last time of the church, when there is no faith, because there is no charity. (That “night” signifies this time, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 2353, 6000.) “Works” are so frequently mentioned, because the sense of the letter of the Word is made up solely of things external, which are in nature and which appear before the eyes; and this in order that there may be a spiritual sense in each particular, as a soul in a body, for otherwise the Word would not be a means of communication with the angels, for it would be like a house without a foundation (see above, n. 8, 16). From this also it is that when “works” are mentioned, angels, because they are spiritual, do not understand works, but the things from which works spring, which are, as was said above, the will or love, and thought therefrom which is of faith. (This subject you will find more clearly explained in Heaven and Hell, n. 470–483, where it is shown that man is after death such as his life was in the world.) “Toil,” in the spiritual sense, means all things that man thinks, because spiritual toiling is thinking. And “endurance” signifies all things that man does, because “to endure” here means to be assiduous, and to put away the obstructions in the natural man that are continually rising up and hindering. 99. And that thou canst not bear the evil, signifies that they reject evils. This is evident from the signification of “canst not bear,” as being to reject, for what a man cannot bear he rejects. “The evil” signify evils, because the thought of angels is abstracted from persons; when, therefore, in the sense of the letter of the Word “the evil” are mentioned, angels think of evils; for by “the evil,” men who are evil, thus persons, are meant. The thought of angels is of this character because they are in heavenly wisdom, and that wisdom has extension into the universal heaven; if therefore they should think with thought determined to persons, that extension would perish, and their wisdom with it.

And hast tried them that say that they are apostles and they are not, and hast found them liars, signifies also falsities, so far as they are able to search them out. This is evident from the signification of “to try,” as being to inquire into and search out; and from the signification of “apostles,” as being those who teach the truths of the church, and in a sense abstracted from persons, the truths themselves that are taught (of which in what follows); also from the signification of “and are not, and are found liars,” as being not truths but falsities; for a “lie” and a “liar” signify falsity (Arcana Coelestia, n. 8908, 9248). From this and what precedes it is evident that “I know that thou canst not bear the evil, and hast tried them that say they are apostles and they are not, and hast found them liars,” signifies that they reject evils, and falsities also, so far as they are able to search them out. For in the things written to this church those who are in the knowledges of truth and good, thus in the knowledges of such things as are of heaven and of the church, are treated of (see above, n. 93); here, therefore, it is first said of them that they put away evils, and falsities also, so far as they are able to search them out; for those who are in the knowledges of the holy things of the church need first to know in general what good and truth are, also what evil and falsity are, for upon this knowledge all other knowledges are founded. (For this reason also Doctrine of the New Jerusalem first of all treats of good and truth, n. 11–27, and from these it can also be seen what evil and falsity are.) [2] By “apostles” those who teach the truths of the church are signified, because the apostles [those sent] were so called from their having been sent to teach and to preach the gospel concerning the Lord and the drawing nigh of the kingdom of God through him; thus to teach the truths of the church, by which the Lord is known and the kingdom of God is brought nigh.

From this it is evident what is meant by “apostles” in the spiritual sense of the Word, namely, not the twelve apostles who were sent by the Lord to teach concerning him and his kingdom, but all who are in the truths of the church, and in a sense abstracted from persons, the truths themselves. For in the Word it is customary to speak of persons; but those who are in its spiritual sense, as angels are, do not think of persons at all, but their thought is abstracted from persons, and has respect therefore solely to things. The reason is, that it is material to think of persons, but spiritual to think apart from the idea of persons; for instance, where the “disciples” are mentioned in the Word, or “prophets,” “priests,” “kings,” “Jews,” “Israel,” “the inhabitants of Zion,” and of “Jerusalem,” and so on. (Moreover, the very names of persons and places are changed with angels into things, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 768, 1224, 1264, 1876, 1888, 4310, 4442, 5095, 5225, 6516, 10216, 10282, 10329, 10432; and that the thought of angels is abstracted from persons, n. 8343, 8985, 9007.) [3] That the disciples of the Lord were called apostles from their having been sent to teach concerning him and his kingdom is clear in Luke: Jesus sent his twelve disciples to preach the kingdom of God. And the apostles, when they were returned, declared unto him what things they had done. And Jesus spake to them of the kingdom of God (Luke 9:1, 2, 10, 11). When it was day, Jesus called his disciples; and he chose from the twelve, whom also he named apostles (Luke 6:13). I will send unto them prophets and apostles, and some of them they shall kill and persecute (Luke 11:49).

(That by “new Jerusalem” is meant the church in respect to doctrine, see New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine, n. 6; that by its “wall” are signified the truths of doctrine for defense, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 6419; by the “foundations of the wall” are signified the knowledges of the truth, on which doctrine is founded, n. 9643; by “twelve” are signified all truths in the complex, n. 577, 2089, 2129, 2130, 3272, 3858, 3913. From this it is clear why it is said that in the foundations of the wall were the “names of the twelve apostles of the lamb.”) 101. Verse 3. And hast borne and hast endurance, signifies resistance against those who assail the truths of faith, and diligence in instructing. This is evident from the signification of “bearing,” in reference to those who are in the knowledges of truth and good, as being resistance against those who assail the truths of faith, for those who are in knowledges defend those truths, and resist those who are against them; also from the signification of having “endurance” or “patience,” as being diligence in instructing. 102a. And for my name’s sake hast toiled, is the acknowledgment of the Lord and of the knowledges of truth that have respect to him. This is evident from the signification of “the name” of Jehovah, or of the Lord, as being, in the highest sense, his Divine human (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 2628, 6887), and in a relative sense, all things of love and faith by which the Lord is worshiped, because these are things Divine that proceed from his Divine human (n. 2724, 3006, 6674, 9310). This is evident also from the signification of “toiling,” as being to strive with mind and zeal that these things may be known and acknowledged; for this is signified by “toiling” when it is said of those who apply themselves to the knowledges of truth and good. From this it follows that “for my name’s sake hast toiled” signifies the acknowledgment of the Lord,"

In many passages of the Word it is said, “for the sake of Jehovah’s name,” “for the sake of the Lord’s name,” “for the sake of the name of Jesus Christ,” that “the name of God should be sanctified,” and the like. Those whose thoughts do not go beyond the sense of the letter suppose that the name alone is meant; but what is meant is not the name, but everything whereby the Lord is worshiped; and all of this has relation to love and faith. Therefore by “the Lord’s name” in the Word all things of love and of faith by which he is worshiped are meant; here the acknowledgment of the Lord and of the knowledges of truth that have respect to him, because this is said to those who are only zealous about knowledges. [2] That “Jehovah’s name” or the “Lord’s name” does not mean the name itself, but all things of love and faith, is from the spiritual world. There the names used on the earth are not uttered; but the names of the persons who are spoken of are formed from the idea of all things known about them combined into a single word. In this way names in the spiritual world are expressed; consequently names there, like all the other things, are spiritual. The names “Lord” and “Jesus Christ,” even, are not uttered there as on the earth, but in place of those names a name is formed from the idea of all things known and believed respecting him; and this idea is made up of all things of love to him and faith in him. This is because these in the complex are the Lord in them; for the Lord is in everyone in the goods of love and of faith that are from him. As this is so, the quality of everyone there, in respect to love to the Lord and faith in the Lord, is immediately known if he only utters “Lord” or “Jesus Christ” by a spiritual expression or spiritual name; and for the same reason also, those who are not in any love to him or faith in him are unable to speak his name, that is, to form any spiritual name of him. From this it is now clear why by the “name” of Jehovah, of the Lord, or of Jesus Christ, name is not meant in the Word, but everything of love and of faith whereby he is worshiped."

Who could ever understand these things unless he knew what “name” signifies? [7] To love and to do truth for the sake of truth, and good for the sake of good, is to have affection for truth and good for their sake, and not for the sake of one’s own reputation, honor, or gain. Such affection of truth and good is a truly spiritual affection; but the affection of truth and good for the sake of one’s own reputation, honor, or gain, is a merely natural affection. And as those who love truth and good for the sake of truth and good, or because they are truth and good, are in the spiritual affection of truth and good, therefore it is said that they shall receive “a prophet’s reward” and “a righteous one’s reward”; which means that they are in the spiritual affection of truth and good, and this affection has reward in itself, because it has heaven in itself. (That the happiness of heaven is in the affection of loving and doing truth and good, without regard to reward as an end, thus for the sake of truth and good, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 6388, 6478, 9174, 9984.

Those who are in a life according to these go forward and do not fail; but those who are as yet in knowledges alone, go forward as far as they can, but do not yet have the light of life, from which is vigor. 104. Verse 4. But I have against thee that thou hast left thy first charity, signifies that they do not make such a life as those lived who were in the church at its beginning, the essential of knowledges. This is evident from the signification of “first charity,” as being a life according to the knowledges of good and truth, such as those lived who were in the church at its beginning (of which presently); and from the signification of “leaving that charity,” as being not to make it the essential of knowledges; for those who are eager for the knowledges of truth and good, and who believe that they are saved thereby, make knowledges essential, and not life, when yet a life according to knowledges is the essential. But as this essential of the church and of salvation is treated of in what follows, more will there be said about it. Charity is life, because all life in accordance with the precepts of the Lord in the Word is called “charity”; therefore to exercise charity is to live according to those precepts. (That this is so, see Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, in the chapter on love to the neighbor or charity, n. 84–106; and in Last Judgment, n. 33–39.) The life of the church at its beginning is here meant by “first charity”; for every church begins from charity, and successively turns away from it to faith alone or to meritorious works. (On which subject, and on charity, see what is shown in Arcana Coelestia, namely, that every church begins from charity, but in process of time turns away from it, n. 494, 501, 1327, 3773, 4689; thus to falsities from evil, and at length to evils, n. 1834, 1835, 2910, 4683, 4689; commonly to faith alone, n. 1834, 1835, 2231, 4683, 8094.

This is evident from the signification of “be mindful,” as being here the remembrance of former things; from the signification of “whence thou hast fallen,” as being deviation therefrom, thus deviation from the truth; from the signification of “repent,” as being that it may come into mind; and from the signification of “doing the first works,” as being the good of life of the church at its beginning.

That a life in accordance with knowledges is the essential of the church, and not knowledges apart from such a life, can be seen by everyone who thinks about it; for knowledges, so long as there is no life according to them, reside in the memory only; and so long as they reside there only they do not affect man’s interiors; for memory is given to man to be a receptacle, from which may be taken what will be serviceable to the life; and things are serviceable to the life when a man wills them and does them.

Whether you say will or love it is the same, for what a man loves he wills; so whether you say that the spirit of man cannot resist his will, or that it cannot resist his love, it is the same. The knowledges of good and truth, before they enter a man’s will or love, contribute nothing whatever to his salvation, because they are not within the man; but out of him. But still knowledges are necessary, for without them man can know nothing of spiritual life, and he who knows nothing of spiritual life cannot become spiritual; for that which a man knows he can think, can will, and can do, but not that which he does not know. But yet if knowledges enter no deeper than into the memory and into thought therefrom, they do not affect him, and consequently do not save him. [3] It is believed by many in the world at this day, especially by those who make faith alone the essential of the church, that to know doctrinals and from mere knowing to believe that they are true, saves man, however he may live; but I can affirm that no one is saved by these alone. I have seen many, even the most learned, cast into hell; but on the other hand, those who have lived according to the knowledges of truth and good from the Word I have seen raised up into heaven. From this it is clear that knowledges are of no avail, but a life according to them; and that knowledges merely teach how man ought to live. To live according to the knowledges of truth and good is to think that one must do thus and not otherwise because it ia commanded by the Lord in the Word. When man thus thinks and thus wills and does, he becomes spiritual. Yet it is necessary for those within the church to believe in the Lord, and when they think of him to think of his Divine in the human, since from his Divine human everything of charity and faith proceed. 106.

But [this] thou hast, that thou hatest the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate, signifies an aversion, derived from the Divine, towards those who separate good from truth or charity from faith, from which separation there is no life. This is evident from the signification of “thou hast that thou hatest,” as being aversion (it is aversion derived from the Divine, because it is said, “which I also hate”); also from the signification of “works,” as being the things of the mind, that works spring from (see above, n. 98); from the signification of the “Nicolaitans,” as being those who separate good from truth, or charity from faith, such as do this being without life. These have no life, because all spiritual life is from charity, and from faith separate from charity there is no life. For to know and think are of faith, but to will and to do are of charity. Those that separate charity from faith can know nothing whatever of what makes heaven and the church with man, thus of what makes spiritual life; for they do not think within themselves, but outside of themselves. To think outside of oneself is to think from memory only; for the memory is outside of the man, being as it were a court, through which is an entrance into the house and its chambers; and into the thought that is outside of man heaven cannot flow in, for heaven flows into the things that are within man, and through these into the things that are outside of him. Such, therefore, cannot be taught what makes heaven and the church, or life eternal; for everyone is taught from heaven, that is, through heaven from the Lord, about the things that pertain to life eternal; thus he is taught by way of his life, which is by way of his soul and heart. He is greatly deceived who supposes that those who separate charity from faith can be in the knowledges of truth.

Such as these, since they have regard only to these laws, conjoin themselves to this world alone, for which these laws are; but the former have regard to the Lord, and thereby conjoin themselves to him. Gentiles are saved solely by this, that in their life they have regard to religion, thinking and saying that they ought to do thus and not otherwise, because to do otherwise would be contrary to the laws of their religion, thus contrary to the Divine; and when they thus think, and act accordingly, they are endowed with spiritual life, which with them is of such quality that afterwards, in the spiritual world, they receive"

In Revelation it is added, “what the spirit saith unto the churches”; since by this is signified what Divine truth teaches and says to those who are of the church, or what is the same, what the Lord teaches and says, for all Divine truth proceeds from him (see Heaven and Hell, n. 13, 133, 137, 139); for this reason the Lord did not himself say, “what the spirit saith,” because he who spoke was the Divine truth. [2] That knowing and understanding Divine truths does not make the church and form heaven with man, but knowing, understanding, and doing, the Lord teaches plainly in many passages; as in Matthew: He that heareth these words of mine and doeth them, is likened unto a prudent man, but he that heareth and doeth them not, is likened unto a foolish man (Matt. 7:24, 26). He that was sown upon good land, this is he that heareth the Word, and taketh heed and thence beareth fruit (Matt. 13:23). In Luke: Everyone that cometh to me and heareth my words, and doeth them, I will show to whom he is like. He is like a man building a house, who laid the foundation on a rock. But he that heareth and doeth not is like a man that built a house upon the earth, without a foundation (Luke 6:47–49)."

In these passages, “hearing” signifies simply hearing, which is knowing and understanding. “Hearing,” in common discourse, has this meaning when one is said “to hear” a thing; but it means both understanding and doing when it is said “give ear to,” or “hearken to,” also “listen to.” Moreover, those who have separated life from faith are like those of whom the Lord speaks in Matthew: Seeing they see not, and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand (Matt. 13:13–15; Ezek. 12:2). 109. To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, signifies that he who receives in the heart shall be filled with the good of love and with heavenly joy therefrom. This is evident from the signification of “overcoming,” as being to receive in the heart (of which in what follows); also from the signification of “eating,” as being to be appropriated and to be conjoined (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 2187, 2343, 3168, 3813, 5643); and from the signification of “the tree of life,” as being the good of love and heavenly joy therefrom (of which also in what follows). “To overcome” is to receive in the heart, because everyone who is to receive spiritual life must fight against evils and falsities which belong to his natural life; and when he overcomes these he receives in the heart the goods and truths which belong to the spiritual life. To receive in the heart is to receive in the will and love, for “heart” in the Word signifies the will and love (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 2930, 3313, 7542, 8910, 9050, 9113, 10336). To receive in the heart, then, is to do these from the will or love; this is what is meant by “overcoming.” [2] “The tree of life” signifies the good of love and heavenly joy therefrom, because “trees” signify such things as are with man in his interiors, which are of his mind [mens] or disposition [animus]; “boughs” and “leaves” signifying those things that are of the knowledges of truth and good, and “fruits” the goods of life themselves.

To those, however, who are not in knowledges, and who are in evil of life, no trees appear, but stones and sands instead. These appearances in the spiritual world really flow from correspondence, for the interiors of the minds of those there are by such effigies presented actually before their eyes. (These things may be better seen from two chapters in Heaven and Hell; first, where the correspondence of heaven with all things of earth is treated of, n. 103–115; and the other, where representatives and appearances in heaven are treated of, n. 170–176, and in what follows there, n. 177–190.)

The establishment of the church is there treated of: The glory of Lebanon shall come unto thee, the fir tree, the pine, and the box tree together, to deck the place of my sanctuary (Isa. 60:13). All the trees of the field shall know that I, Jehovah, humble the high tree, exalt the low tree, dry up the green tree, and make the dry tree to bud (Ezek. 17:24). Behold, I will kindle a fire in thee, and it shall devour the green tree in thee, and every dry tree (Ezek. 20:47).

By the river flowing out from the house of God, upon the bank on this side and on that, ascendeth the tree of food, whose leaf falleth not off, nor is its fruit consumed; it is renewed in its months, because its waters issue out of the sanctuary, whence its fruit is for food, and its leaf for medicine (Ezek. 47:12). In the midst of the street and of the river (flowing out from the throne of God and of the lamb), on this side and on that, was the tree of life, bearing twelve fruits, yielding its fruit every month, and the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations (Rev. 22:1, 2). Blessed is the man whose delight is in the law; he shall be like a tree planted by the streams of waters, that bringeth forth its fruit in its time, whose leaf also doth not wither (Ps. 1:3).

For by “tabernacles” were signified the goods of heavenly love, and holy worship therefrom (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 414, 1102, 2145, 2152, 3312, 4391, 10545); and by the “feast of tabernacles” was signified the implantation of that good or love (n. 9296). Because “fruits” signified the goods of love which are goods of life: It was amongst the blessings that the tree of the field should give its fruit, and among the curses that it should not bear fruit (Lev. 26:4, 20). So also it was a command that when any city was besieged: They should not lay the axe to any tree of good fruit (Deut. 20:19, 20). From all this it can be seen that “fruits” signify the goods of love, or what is the same, the goods of life, which are also called “works,” as likewise in these passages in the Evangelists: The axe lieth unto the root of the tree; every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit shall be hewn down and cast into the fire (Matt. 3:10; 7:16–21). Either make the tree good and the fruit good, or else make the tree corrupt and the fruit corrupt; for the tree is known by its fruit (Matt. 12:33; Luke 6:43, 44).

Jesus saw a fig tree by the way; he came to it, and found nothing thereon but leaves only; and he said, Nevermore from thee shall there be fruit. And immediately the fig tree withered away (Matt. 21:19; Mark 11:13, 14, 20). The “fig tree” signifies the natural man and its interiors, and “fruits” signify his goods (Arcana Coelestia, n. 217, 4231, 5113); but “leaves” signify knowledges (n. 885). From this it is clear what is signified by the fig tree’s withering away because the Lord found on it leaves only and no fruit. All these passages are cited that it may be known what is signified by the “tree of life in the midst of the paradise of God,” namely, the good of love proceeding from the Lord, and heavenly joy therefrom. 110. Which is in the midst of the paradise of God, signifies that all the knowledges of good and truth in heaven and in the church look thereto and proceed therefrom. This is evident from the signification of “the midst,” as being the center to which all things that are round about look and from which they proceed (of which above, n. 97) and from the signification of “paradise,” as being the knowledges of good and truth and intelligence therefrom (Arcana Coelestia, n. 100, 108, 1588, 2702, 3220); and because these are signified by “paradise,” therefore by the “paradise of God” heaven is signified, and as heaven, so also the church is signified, for the church is the Lord’s heaven on the earth. Heaven and the church are called the “paradise of God,” because the Lord is in the midst of them, and from him is all intelligence and wisdom. Since it has not been known heretofore that all things in the Word are written by correspondences, consequently that there are spiritual things in every particular that is mentioned therein, it is believed that by the “paradise” treated of in the second chapter of Genesis, a paradisal garden is meant. But no earthly paradise is there meant, but the heavenly paradise which those possess who are in intelligence and wisdom from the knowledges of good and truth (see above, n. 109; and Heaven and Hell, n. 176, 185)."

In Ezekiel: Thou hast been in Eden, the garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering (Ezek. 28:13). These things are said of Tyre, because by “Tyre” in the Word a church that is in the knowledges of truth and good and in intelligence therefrom is signified (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 1201); its intelligence therefrom is “Eden, the garden of God,” likewise “the precious stone” from which is its “covering” (see n. 114, 9863, 9865, 9868, 9873). In the same: Behold Asshur a cedar in Lebanon. The cedars have not hid it in the garden of God; nor was any tree in the garden of God equal to it in beauty. I have made it beautiful by the multitude of its branches; and all the trees of Eden in the garden of God envied it (Ezek. 31:3, 8, 9).

From this it can be seen that all things taught by the church from the Word look to the Lord and to love to him, as the end to which [ad quem]. That all knowledges of good and truth, or all doctrinals from the Word, proceed from the Lord is also known in the church, for it is there taught that everything of love and everything of faith is from heaven, and that nothing is from man; and that no one can love God and believe in him from himself. To love God and to believe in him involve all things that the church teaches, called doctrinals and knowledges, since from these is God loved and believed in. There is no love and faith without previous knowledges; for without knowledges man would be empty.

From this, taken together, it follows that the natural man can by no means become spiritual without the knowledges of good and truth from the Word. [4] By “the angel of the church of the Smyrneans” are meant those within the church who wish to understand the Word, but do not yet understand, and therefore are as yet but little in the knowledges of truth and good, which nevertheless they desire because they are in the spiritual affection of truth; and those who are in the spiritual affection of truth are also in the life of charity, for from that they have spiritual affection. The spiritual comes to man from no other source than from charity. Those who are in spiritual affection are interested in the Word, and desire nothing more earnestly than to understand it. But as there are innumerable things therein that they do not understand, because the Word in its bosom is spiritual and the spiritual includes infinite arcana, therefore, so long as man lives in the world and then sees from the natural man, he can be but little in the knowledges of truth and good, and in generals only, in which, however, innumerable things may be implanted when he comes into the spiritual world or heaven.

That it is the Lord in respect to the Divine human who here and in what follows speaks to the angels of the churches, can be seen from the preceding chapter, where similar things are said of the son of man; and the son of man is the Lord in respect to the Divine human (see above, n. 63). This is clearly shown by bringing the passages together; for example, the son of man is described in the preceding chapter as seen: In the midst of the golden lamp stands, having in his right hand seven stars (Rev. 1:13, 16). These same things introduce what is written to the angel of the Ephesian church in these words, “These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, that walketh in the midst of the seven golden lamp stands” (verse 1 of this chapter).

In the preceding chapter the son of man is described, that there was seen: Out of his mouth a sharp two-edged sword going forth (Rev. 1:16). This introduces what is written to the angel of the church Pergamum, in these words: These things saith he that hath the sharp two-edged sword (Rev. 1:12). In the preceding chapter the son of man is described, that he was seen to have: Eyes as a flame of fire; and feet like unto burnished brass, as if glowing in a furnace (Rev. 1:14–15).

And as the Lord is the all in all things of heaven, he is also the all in all things of the church, for the church is the kingdom of the Lord on the earth.) This I can affirm, that no one who is within the church, and does not acknowledge the Divine of the Lord in his human, can enter heaven. To acknowledge the Divine of the Lord in his human is to think of his Divine when thinking of his human. That it must be so thought of is because the whole heaven is from his Divine human (as may be seen shown in Heaven and Hell, from beginning to end; and above in the explanation of Revelation, n. 10, 49, 52, 82). 114. Who was dead and is alive, signifies that he has been rejected, and yet eternal life is from him. This is evident from the signification of being “dead,” as being, in reference to the Lord, to have been rejected (of which see above, n. 83); also from the signification of “being alive,” as being that eternal life is from him (of which also above, n. 84). The Lord is said to have been rejected when he is not approached and worshiped; and also when he is approached and worshiped in respect to his human only, and not at the same time in respect to the Divine; therefore he is rejected at the present time within the church by those who do not approach and worship him, but pray to the Father to have compassion for the sake of the son, when yet neither man nor angel can ever approach the Father and worship him immediately; for the Divine is invisible, and with it no one can be conjoined by faith and love; since what is invisible does not come into the idea of thought, nor, consequently, into the affection of the will; and what does not fall into the idea of thought does not fall within the faith; for the things that are to be of faith must be thought of. So also what does not enter into the affection of the will does not enter into love, for what is to be of the love must affect man’s will, for all the love that man has resides in the will (see Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, n. 28–35). [2] But the Divine human of the Lord does come into the idea of the thought and thus into faith, and from that into the affection of the will, that is, into love.

Ye have neither heard the Father’s voice at any time, nor seen his shape (John 5:37). In Matthew: No one knoweth the Father save the son, and he to whom the son willeth to reveal him (Matt. 11:27).

When yet to think of the human only, and not at the same time of his Divine in the human, is to view the two as separated, which is not to view the Lord, nor the two as one person; and yet the doctrine received throughout Christendom is, that the Divine and the human of the Lord are not two persons but a single person. [4] It is true that men of the church at this day, when they speak from the doctrine of the church think of the Divine of the Lord in his human; but when they think and speak by themselves aside from doctrine, it is altogether otherwise. But be it known, that man is in one state when he is thinking and speaking from doctrine, and in another when he is thinking and speaking aside from doctrine. When man is thinking and speaking from doctrine, his thought and speech are from the memory of his natural man; but when he is thinking and speaking aside from doctrine, his thought and speech are from his spirit; for to think and speak from the spirit, is to think and speak from the interiors of one’s mind, from which is his real faith. Moreover, man’s state after death becomes such as were the thought and speech of his spirit by himself aside from doctrine, and not such as they were from doctrine, if the latter was not one with the former. [5] Man does not know that he has two states in respect to faith and love; one when in doctrine and another aside from doctrine; but that the state of his faith and love aside from doctrine is what saves him, and not the state of his speech respecting faith and love from doctrine, unless the latter state makes one with the former. Yet to think and speak from doctrine respecting faith and love is to speak from the natural man and its memory, as is evident merely from this, that the evil, when with others, can think and speak thus equally with the good. For the same reason also evil preachers equally with good, or preachers that have no faith equally with those that have faith, can preach the gospel, and, to appearance, with similar zeal and affection. This is because the man, as has been said, then thinks and speaks from his natural man and its memory. But to think from one’s spirit is not to think from the natural man and its memory, but from the spiritual man, and from its faith and"

Merely from this it is clear that man has two states, and that it is the latter state, not the former, that saves him; for man after death is a spirit; therefore such as he was in the world in respect to his spirit, such he remains after his departure out of the world. [6] Moreover, it has been given me to know from much experience that the man of the church has these two states. For after death, man can be let into either state, and is also actually let into both. Many of these, when they have been let into the former state, have spoken like Christians, and from such speech have been believed by others to be Christians; but as soon as they were remitted into the latter state, which was the real state of their spirit they spoke like devilish spirits, and altogether in opposition to what they had spoken before (see Heaven and Hell, n. 491–498, 499–511). [7] From this it can be seen how the statement is to be understood that the Lord has been at this day rejected by those within the church; namely, that although it is held from doctrine that the Divine of the Lord must be acknowledged and believed in the same degree as the Divine of the Father, for the doctrine of the church teaches that “As is the Father so also is the son, uncreate, infinite, eternal, omnipotent, God, Lord, and neither of them greater or less, before or after the other” (see the Creed of Athanasius); yet they do not approach and worship the Lord and his Divine, but the Divine of the Father; this they do when they pray to the Father to have mercy for the sake of the son; and when they say this they do not think at all of the Divine of the Lord, but they think of his human as separated from the Divine, thus of his human as similar to the human of any other man; and then they also think not of one God, but of two, or three. To think in this way of the Lord is to reject him; for by not thinking of his Divine at the same time that they think of his human, by the separation they thrust out the Divine. Yet these are not two, but one person, and make one as soul and body do."

They said that they thought about it whenever they saw from doctrine, and that they then acknowledged his Divine to be equal with the Divine of the Father, but that apart from doctrine, they thought of his human only, and not of his Divine. They were asked why they say that the power which his human had was given to it by the Father and not by himself, since they acknowledged his Divine to be equal with that of the Father. At this they turned away, making no answer. But it was said to them, that it was because they transferred to themselves all his Divine power, and that they could not have done this unless they had separated the Divine from the human. That with them the Lord has been rejected, everyone may conclude from this, that they worship the pope instead of the Lord, and that they no longer attribute any power to the Lord. [9] I will here also mention a great scandal heard from the pope called Benedict XIV. He openly declared that when he lived in the world he believed that the Lord had no power, because he had transferred it all to Peter, and after him to his successors; adding his belief that their saints have more power than the Lord, because they hold it from God the Father, while the Lord resigned it all and gave it to the popes; yet that he is still to be worshiped, because otherwise the pope is not worshiped with sanctity. But because this pope even after death claimed the Divine for himself, after a few days he was cast into hell. 115.

It is with such that the Lord is “dead,” that is, rejected. The spiritual affection of truth, which is loving truth because it is truth, exists only with those who are conjoined to the Lord by the acknowledgment of his Divine in the human, and by faith in it; since all the truth of heaven and all the truth of the church is from no other source than the Lord’s Divine human; for out of this proceeds Divine truth, which is called “the spirit of Truth,” or “the Holy Spirit.” From this the angels of heaven have all their affection of truth and all their wisdom (that this is so, see Heaven and Hell n. 126–140, 265–275, 346–356). It is with these that the Lord is alive. 116. Verse 9. I know thy works, signifies love. This is evident from the signification of “works,” as being the things that are of the will or love, since works proceed therefrom, and that from which anything proceeds constitutes the all in that which proceeds, as cause does in effect, for when the cause is taken away or ceases the effect ceases. So it is with man’s will and works therefrom; will is the cause and works are the effects, and it is well known that when will ceases work ceases. From this it is clear that “works” in relation to cause are the will. The will of man is spiritual, but works therefrom are natural; therefore here by “works,” in the spiritual sense, the will is meant. By “works” is meant also the love, because what a man loves that he wills, and what in heart he wills that he loves; and if you look more deeply you will see that all things of man’s interior will are of his love. Yet in common discourse we speak of man’s love, not of his will, because the loves are manifold, and there are many in one man, and all are together in the will, which is perceived by man as a one, because he distinguishes between will and understanding. The will, therefore, is man’s spiritual itself, because love is spiritual. “Works” are mentioned in the Word, and not the will or love (as here and in what follows, to the angels of the churches, “I know thy works,” and not “I know thy will,” or “thy love”), because all things that are in the sense of the letter of the Word are natural, and contain within them things spiritual; to bring out, therefore, the"

This is evident from the signification of “affliction,” as being anxiety of mind from a longing to know truths; for those who wish to understand the Word, but who do not as yet well understand it, are here treated of (see above, n. 112), and these are in anxiety as to the spirit when they do not understand. That these have such anxiety when they do not understand, none can know except those who are in the affection of truth for the sake of truth, that is, who are in spiritual affection; who these are may be seen above (n. 115). The reason of this is, that such are conjoined to the angels of heaven, and angels continually long for truths, because they long for intelligence and wisdom; they long for these as a hungry man longs for food. For this reason also intelligence and wisdom are called spiritual food. This longing also man has from infancy, for when he is an infant, and afterwards when a child, he is conjoined to heaven, and this longing is from heaven; but with those who turn themselves to the world it perishes. From this it may be known what is the anxiety of mind or spiritual anxiety that is here signified by “affliction.” [2] They have such anxiety when they read the Word and do not well understand it, because all the truths of heaven and the church are from the Word, and lie concealed therein in its spiritual sense, and are not opened to any except such as are conjoined to heaven, since that sense of the Word is in heaven. Yet the spiritual sense itself of the Word does not flow in with man out of heaven, but it flows into his affection, and through this into the knowledges that he has, and thus kindles his longing, and he then receives the genuine truths of the church so far as he can see them from the literal sense of the Word. Everyone who is in the spiritual affection of truth is conscious that the things that he knows are few, and the things that he does not know are infinite. He is aware, moreover, that knowing and acknowledging this is the first step towards wisdom; and that those who pride themselves on the things they know, and believe themselves on account of these to be most"

Such persons also commonly glory more from falsities than from truths, for they have regard to their own reputation, and are affected by that alone, and not by truth itself. Such are they who are in natural affection only and in longing from that (see above, n. 115). 118. And poverty, but thou art rich, signifies the acknowledgment that they know nothing from themselves. This is evident from the signification of “poverty,” as being the acknowledgment of heart that they know nothing from themselves (of which presently); and from the signification of “but thou art rich,” as being the affection of spiritual truth (of which also presently). That by “poverty” spiritual poverty is here meant, and that by “thou art rich” is meant to be spiritually rich, is clear, since these things are said to the church. To be spiritually poor, and yet to be rich, is to acknowledge in heart that one has no knowledge nor understanding nor wisdom from himself, but that he knows, understands, and is wise wholly from the Lord. In such acknowledgment are all the angels of heaven, wherefore they are also intelligent and wise, and this in the same degree in which they are in the acknowledgment and perception that this is the case. For they know and perceive that nothing of the truth that is called the truth of faith, and nothing of the good that is called the good of love, is from themselves, but that these are from the Lord; they also know and perceive that all things that they understand and in which they are wise have reference to the truth of faith and to the good of love; and from this again they know that all their intelligence and wisdom is from the Lord; and because they know and acknowledge this, and also wish and love it to be so, Divine truth from which are all intelligence and wisdom continually flows in from the Lord, and this they receive in the measure in which they are affected by it, that is, love it. But, on the other hand, the spirits of hell believe that all things which they think and will, and thence speak and do, are from themselves, and nothing from God; for they do not believe in a Divine; consequently, instead of intelligence and wisdom they have insanity and folly, for they think contrary to truth, and will contrary to good, and this is to be insane and foolish.

[2] From this it can be known what “poverty” in the spiritual sense means. He who is spiritually poor is nevertheless rich, because he is in the spiritual affection of truth; for into this affection intelligence and wisdom from the Lord flow; for everyone’s affection receives and imbibes things congenial to it, as a sponge does water; therefore the spiritual affection of truth receives and imbibes spiritual truths, which are the truths of the church, from the Word. The spiritual affection of truth has no other source than the Lord, because the Lord is Divine truth in heaven and in the church, for Divine truth proceeds from him. And as the Lord loves to lead everyone to himself, and to save him, and this he can do only by the knowledges of good and truth from the Word, so the Lord loves to impart these to man, and make them of his life, for in this way and no other can he lead man to himself and save him. From this it is manifest that all spiritual affection of truth is from the Lord, and that no one can be in that affection unless he acknowledges the Divine of the Lord in his human, for by such acknowledgment there is conjunction, and according to conjunction there is reception.

But by the “rich man” there the Jewish nation is meant, which had the Word, and might from it have been in the knowledges of truth and good; and by the “poor man” are there meant the Gentiles that had not the Word and yet longed for the knowledges of truth and good. The rich man is described as “clothed with purple and fine linen,” because “purple” signifies genuine good (Arcana Coelestia, n. 9467), and the “fine linen” genuine truth (Arcana Coelestia, n. 5319, 9469, 9596, 9744), both from the Word. The poor man is described as “laid at the rich man’s gate, and desiring to be fed with the crumbs that fell from the rich man’s table,” because by “to be laid at the gate” is meant to be rejected, and to be deprived of the opportunity to read and understand the Word; and “wishing to be fed with the crumbs that fell from the rich man’s table” means to long for some truths from the Word, for “food” signifies the things of knowledge, intelligence, and wisdom and in general, good and truth (Arcana Coelestia, n. 3114, 4459, 4792, 5147, 5293, 5340, 5342, 5410, 5426, 5576, 5582, 5588, 5655, 8562, 9003); and “table” signifies a receptacle for these (Arcana Coelestia, n. 9527).

That “riches” in the Word signify the knowledges of truth and good, and intelligence and wisdom therefrom, is from correspondence; for with the angels in heaven all things appear as if refulgent with gold, and silver, and precious stones; and this so far as they are in the intelligence of truth and in the wisdom of good. Also with the spirits who are below the heavens there are riches in appearance according to the reception of truth and good from the Lord with them. 119. And the blasphemy of them who say that they are Jews and they are not, signifies denunciation by those who think themselves to be in the knowledges of good and truth because they have the Word, and yet they are not. This is evident from the signification of “blasphemy,”as being reviling and denunciation; and from the signification of “Jews,” as being those who are in the knowledges of good and truth from the Word; for “Judah,” in the highest sense of the Word, signifies the Lord in respect to celestial love, in the internal sense the Lord’s celestial kingdom and the Word, and in the external sense doctrine from the Word, which is of the celestial church (see Arcana Coelestia, 3881, 6363). From this it can be seen that by the “blasphemy of them who say that they are Jews and they are not,” is signified reviling and denunciation by those who say that they acknowledge the Lord, and are in his kingdom and in true doctrine, because they have the Word, and yet they are not; in general, those who say that they are in the knowledges of good and truth from the Word, and yet are in falsities and evils. [2] Those who know nothing of the internal sense of the Word cannot know otherwise than that by “Judah” and “Jews,” in the prophetical parts of the word, are meant Judah and the Jews; these, however are not there meant by their names, but all who are in the true doctrine of the church, thus who are in the knowledges of good and truth from the Word; and in the contrary sense, those"

That Judah and the Jews are not meant can be seen merely from this, that there is an internal sense in every particular of the Word, and also in the names of persons and places; and that nothing is treated of in this sense except what pertains to heaven and the church; such things, therefore, must also be signified by the names “Judah” and “Israel.” And as with them a church was instituted in which all things were representative and significative of things heavenly, so by their names was signified that which essentially makes the church, namely, in the highest sense, the Lord himself; in the internal sense his Word; and in the external sense doctrine from the Word, as was said above. From this it is clear how greatly those are mistaken who believe, according to the letter, that the Jews are to be brought back into the land of Canaan, and that they have been chosen and destined for heaven in preference to others; when yet but few from that nation are saved, since none are saved except those who believe in the Lord; and he who believes in the Lord in the world, believes in him after death; but that nation has altogether rejected him from its faith. [3] That by “Judah” is meant the Lord in respect to his kingdom and the Word can be seen from the prophecy of Israel regarding his sons; when this is unfolded by the internal sense it is clear what each tribe represented in the church. It is clearly evident that the tribe of Judah represented the Lord’s kingdom, or the church where the Word is; for it is said of Judah: Judah is a lion’s whelp; from the prey, my son, thou art gone up. The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and upon him shall the clinging of the people be; who shall bind to the vine the foal of his ass, and to the noble vine the son of his she-ass; whilst he shall have washed his garment in wine, and his vesture in the blood of grapes (Gen. 49:9–11). That these particulars signify the Lord’s kingdom or the church may be seen in Arcana Coelestia, where they are explained."

The “house of Jacob” and “Israel” is the church; “to come forth out of the waters of Judah” signifies out of doctrine from the Word, for the church is from that. That “waters” denote the truths of doctrine out of the Word, see above (n. 71). The sons of Judah and the sons of Jerusalem have ye sold unto the sons of the Grecians, that ye may remove them far from their borders. It shall come to pass in that day that all the brooks of Judah shall flow with waters, and a fountain shall go forth out of the house of Jehovah, and Judah shall sit to eternity (Joel 3:6, 18, 20). “To sell the sons of Judah and the sons of Jerusalem to the sons of the Grecians” is to falsify the goods and truths of the church; “in that day” means when there is an end of that church and a new church has been established among the Gentiles; “all the brooks of Judah shall flow with waters” signifies the abundance of truth and good from the Word, for those who are in the new church; that these are from the Word is signified by the “fountain going forth out of the house of Jehovah.” From this it is evident that by “Judah,” who “shall sit to eternity,” is not meant Judah or the Jewish nation, but all those who are in good by means of truths from the Word. [5] Like things are meant by “Judah” in the following passages: I will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and will save them. And the sons of Judah and the sons of Israel shall be gathered together, and they shall put over themselves one head, and they shall go up from the land; for great is the day of Jehovah6 (Hos. 1:7, 11)."

I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains; that my chosen may possess it (Isa. 65:9); besides very many other places. That the Jewish nation is not meant in the Word in these and other places, where they are called “chosen” and “heirs,” may be seen from what is cited respecting that nation from Arcana Coelestia, in Doctrine of the New Jerusalem (n. 248). From this now can be seen what is signified by the “blasphemy of them who say that they are Jews, and they are not.” 120.

The hell in which those are who are in evils is called, in one word, devil, and that in which those are who are in the falsities of evil is called, in one word, satan. That the hells are thus named is totally unknown to those who know nothing about the hells, but have adopted the belief that the devil was created an angel of light, and because he rebelled was cast down with his crew, and thus hell was made. (That the hells are called devil and satan may be seen in Heaven and Hell, n. 311, 544, 553; and in Last Judgment, in the chapter where it is shown that heaven and hell are from the human race, n. 14–22.)"

He is greatly deceived who believes that goods and truths have any other source than out of the heavens from the Lord, or that evils and falsities have any other source than out of the hells. Man is simply a receptacle of these, and to whichever he turns himself of that he is a recipient. If he turns himself towards heaven, which is effected by the goods of love and the truths of faith, he receives goods and truths from the Lord; but if he turns himself towards hell, which is effected by the evils of love and falsities of faith, he receives evils and falsities from the hells. Now as all evils and falsities are from the hells, and as the hells are called, in one word, either devil or satan, it follows that by devil are also signified all evils, and by satan all falsities. From this it is that by a “synagogue of satan” the doctrine of all falsities is signified. [3] By “synagogue” doctrine is signified, because in the synagogues there was instruction, and differences in matters of doctrine were also adjusted. That there was instruction in the synagogues is evident from Matt. 4:23; 9:35; 13:54; Mark 1:21, 22, 29, 39; 6:2; Luke 4:15, 16, 44; 13:10, 14; John 18:20.

That with the Jewish nation there was the doctrine of all falsities can be seen from many things known as to that nation; namely, that they denied the Lord; that they wish for a messiah whose kingdom will be upon the earth, and who will exalt them above all other nations in the world; that they place all worship in externals, and reject the internals of worship, which are of faith in the Lord and of love to him; that they apply all things in the Word to themselves; and falsify it by traditions of their own invention (see Matt. 15:6–9; Mark 7:1–13). Again, what the quality of that nation in respect to their interiors has been from the beginning can be seen from the song of Moses (Deut. 32), and elsewhere in many passages (see also the quotations from Arcana Coelestia in Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, n. 248)."

This is evident from the signification of “fear not,” as being, in reference to those about to suffer persecutions, that they should not grieve in mind; for fear with these is also grief; and from the signification of “the things which thou art to suffer,” namely, from those who are in the doctrine of all falsities, as being that such are about to persecute. The persecution of those who are in the spiritual affection of truth, by those who are in falsities, is now treated of. This can best be seen from those who are of this character in the world of spirits (of which world see Heaven and Hell, n. 421–535), for there the quality of everyone in respect to his interiors, which are of thought and intention, is manifest; since everyone there is in himself, because he is a spirit, and the spirit is what thinks and intends. All spirits there are either conjoined with the hells or conjoined with the heavens. Those who are conjoined with the hells, as soon as they perceive anyone to be in the spiritual affection of truth begin to burn with hatred, and strive to destroy him; they cannot endure the sight of him. Very many of them, if they only perceive for a moment the delight of the spiritual affection of truth, which is the delight itself of heaven, become as if insane, and nothing is then more delightful to them than to destroy that delight. From this it is evident that all the hells are opposed to the spiritual affection of truth, and that all the heavens are in it. It would be similar among men on the earths if they were in the perception in which spirits are; but as they are not in such perception, and therefore do not know who are in spiritual affection, they remain quiet and act in a friendly manner towards each other, in accordance with the delights of the world. But this disposition displays itself in the churches, among those who are zealous in religious matters. It also becomes evident with those who are in that spiritual affection, in this way, that falsities break in upon their thoughts, endeavoring to extinguish their longing and the delight thence; these falsities that break in upon their thoughts are from hell; for everything that a man thinks is either from hell or from heaven (as was said above, n. 120)."

This is evident from the signification of “casting into prison,” as being, in reference to those who are in the spiritual affection of truth, to endeavor and to set about to deprive them of truths from the Word (of which presently); and from the signification of the “devil,” as being the hells which are in evil and in falsities therefrom (of which above, n. 120). “To cast into prison,” in reference to those who are in the spiritual affection of truth, is to endeavor and to set about to deprive them of truths from the Word, for the reason that truths are, as it were, in prison or in confinement when falsities break in; and so long as falsities are under view, truths cannot appear, still less can they be set at liberty. Those that are in the spiritual affection of truth, who are those that love truths because they are truths, are held in such confinement whenever they do not understand the Word and yet wish to understand it; the falsities that imprison rise up from hell into the natural man when the delights of the love of self and the world have rule therein, for these delights are the origins of all evils and of the falsities therefrom (see Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, n. 65–83). [2] This is meant, in the spiritual sense, by “being cast by the devil into prison”; for as the devil is hell, and out of hell every evil arises, and as the influx from hell is into the natural man, and not into the spiritual, so the devil affects all who are in the delights of these loves, and subjects them to himself and makes them his crew; for all who are in the hells are in evils and the falsities thence from the loves of self and of the world (see Heaven and Hell, n. 551–565; but that the delights of those loves are changed into correspondences, the character of which may be seen there, n. 485–490). This casting into prison by the devil is described in the Word, where it is said that the Jews and the evil will persecute the Lord’s disciples, and will revile and kill them; for by the “disciples of the Lord” are meant all who are in truths from good, thus who are in truths from the Lord; and as these are meant by the Lord’s"

Whosoever doth not bear his cross, and come after me, cannot be my disciple (Luke 14:27).

Since the Lord was Divine truth itself, which in John 1:1–3, 14, is called the “Word,” the Lord’s suffering himself to be scourged and crucified signifies that Divine truth which is in the Word was so treated by the Jews. (That all things related of the Lord’s passion in the Evangelists involve and signify that the Jews so treated Divine truth, see above, n. 83.) Wherefore the Lord says: Remember my word, if they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you (John 15:20).

Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and stood not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie he speaketh from his own, for he is a liar and the father thereof (John 8:43, 44). That “their father was a murderer from the beginning,” “and the truth was not in him, but a lie,” signifies that from the beginning they had been against truths and in falsities from evil.

It is similar with others who are in these loves, for the love that is dominant turns the mind of him who reads to those things only that favor the love; for love is like a fire, which lights up the things that favor it, while the rest are either passed by as if not seen, or drawn over to one’s side by perverse explanation and thus falsified. Both infest those who are in the spiritual affection of truth, and both are meant by the “devil” who “casts into prison” those who are of the Lord’s church; from them, indeed, all falsities from the spiritual world flow into those that long for truths, and hold them as if bound in confinement.

The number “ten,” without reference to other numbers, signifies what is full or much (Arcana Coelestia, n. 3107, 4638); but in reference to a greater number, it signifies as much as is needed for uses (n. 9757); so here it signifies duration for some time, thus as use demands.

Be thou faithful even till death, signifies steadfastness in truths to the end. This is evident without explanation. It is said “even till death,” because such as man is when he dies, such he remains to eternity; the life previously lived is only the life for the formation of his spirit (of which see many things in Heaven and Hell, n. 470–484). 126.

This is evident from the signification of “crown,” as being wisdom, in reference to those who are in the spiritual affection of the knowledges of truth and good (of which more in what follows); and from the signification of “life,” as being eternal happiness, which is also called life eternal. Those who are in the spiritual affection of truth and good, and who are here treated of, have eternal happiness, because heaven with man is implanted by means of the knowledges of truth and good from the Word.

Man has two minds, one exterior, the other interior. The exterior mind is called the natural mind, but the interior is called the spiritual mind. The former or natural mind is opened by means of the knowledges of the things that are in the world; but the latter or spiritual mind by means of the knowledges of the things that are in heaven, which the Word teaches, and the church from the Word; by means of these man becomes spiritual when he knows them and lives according to them.

Most people at this day believe that they are to come into heaven solely by virtue of holy worship in temples and by adorations and prayers; but such of them as do not care for the knowledges of truth and good from the Word, and who fail to imbue with these the life, as well as the memory, remain natural as before, and do not become spiritual; for their holy worship, adorations, and prayers, do not proceed from any spiritual origin; since their spiritual mind has not been opened by the knowledges of spiritual things and a life according to them, but is empty; and worship that proceeds from what is empty is merely natural gesture, with nothing spiritual in it. If such persons are insincere and unjust in respect to moral and civil life, their holy worship, adorations, and prayers have within them what repels heaven from them, instead of opening heaven to them as they believe; for their holy worship is like a vessel containing things putrid and filthy, which are oozing forth, or like a splendid garment investing a body covered with ulcers.

From this it can be seen that the knowledges of truth and good from the Word, and a life according to them, alone make man spiritual; and that in him who is thereby made spiritual, angelic wisdom from the Lord can be implanted together with eternal happiness. Angels derive happiness from no other source than from wisdom. [3] A “crown” signifies wisdom, because all things by which man is clothed or distinguished derive their signification from the part of man that they clothe or distinguish (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 9827), and “crown” signifies wisdom, because it is a sign upon the head, and “head” in the Word signifies wisdom, for there wisdom resides. So in Ezekiel: I decked thee with ornaments, I put bracelets upon thy hands; and a chain upon thy throat. And I put a jewel upon thy nose, and earrings in thine ears, and a crown of adorning upon thy head (Ezek. 16:11, 12). Jerusalem, which signifies the church, is here treated of, such as it was when it was established by the Lord; by these various insignia are meant, in the spiritual sense, such things as are of the church; and each one takes its signification from the part to which it is applied, and “the crown of adorning” here means wisdom. (But what is meant by “ornament,” may be seen in Arcana Coelestia, n. 10536, 10540; by “bracelets,” n. 3103, 3105; by “chain” n. 5320; by “jewel,” n. 4551; by “earrings,” n. 4551, 10402.) Wisdom, which is from the knowledges of truth and good from the Word and from a life according to them, is likewise signified by “crown” in many other passages in the Word (as in Isa. 28:5; Jer. 13:18; Lam. 5:15, 16; Ezek. 21:25, 26; 23:42; Zech. 6:11–14; Ps. 89:38, 39; Ps. 132:17, 18; Job 19:9; Rev. 3:11; 4:4).

Verse 11. He that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches, signifies that he that understands should hearken to what Divine truth proceeding from the Lord teaches and says to those who are of his church, as may be seen above (n. 108), where similar expressions occur. 128. He that overcometh shall not be hurt by the second death, signifies that he who is steadfast in the genuine affection of truth to the end of his life in the world, shall come into the new heaven. This is evident from the signification of “overcoming,” as being in reference to those who long for the knowledges of truth and good from the Word, to be steadfast in the genuine affection of truth, even to the end of life in the world. It is said “he that overcometh,” because those are meant who endure spiritual temptation, which is from evils and falsities, and who fight; and “to overcome” is to resist evils and falsities, and to tame and subdue them as one’s enemies. But no one overcomes unless he is steadfast in the spiritual affection of truth, even to the end of his life in the world; then the work is finished; for man remains to eternity such as he then is, namely, such as his life has been up to that point; death is what completes it. But no one is able to overcome except the Lord only. The man who supposes that he overcomes of himself, and not that it is the Lord with him that overcomes, does not overcome but succumbs; for it is spiritual faith that overcomes, and there is nothing of spiritual faith from man, but the whole of it is from the Lord.

(Something of what the “former heaven” is can be seen in Last Judgment, n. 65–72; and what the “new heaven” is, in Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, n. 1–7.) But what is meant by the “first death” and by the “second death,” also by the “first resurrection” and “second resurrection,” will be told in the explanation of chapters 20 and 21, where it is said: The rest of the dead shall not live again until the thousand years be finished. This is the first resurrection. Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the second8 resurrection; over these the second death hath no power; but they shall be priests of God and of Christ (Rev. 20:5–6). Their part shall be in the lake that burneth with fire and brimstone, which is the second death (Rev. 21:8). From this it is clear that the “second death” is damnation; to be hurt by it, therefore, is to be damned, and on the other hand, not to be hurt by it is to be saved; and as all that are saved come into the new heaven, to come into the new heaven is signified by “not being hurt by the second death” (of which heaven, and of whom it consists, see New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine, n. 2–6). 129.

But I have against thee a few things, that thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balak to cast a stumbling block before the sons of Israel, to eat idol sacrifices, and to commit whoredom.

And to the angel of the church in Pergamum write, signifies for remembrance to those within the church who are in temptations. This is evident from the signification of “writing,” as being for remembrance (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 8620); and from the signification of “angel,” as being a recipient of Divine truth, and in the highest sense Divine truth itself proceeding from the Lord (of which more in what follows); and from the signification of the “church in Pergamum,” as being those within the church who are in temptations. That these are meant by the “church in Pergamum” is clear from the things written to that church, which follow. From no other source can it be known what is signified by each of the seven churches. For as was shown before, what is meant is not any church in Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, or Laodicea, but all who are of the Lord’s church, and by each of these churches something that constitutes the church with man is meant. And as the first things of the church are the knowledges of truth and good, and the affections of spiritual truth, these are first treated of, namely, in what is written to the angel of the Ephesian church and of the Smyrnean church; of the knowledges of truth and good to the angel of the Ephesian church, and of the spiritual affection of truth to the angel of the Smyrnean church. And as no one can be imbued with the knowledges of truth and good in respect to life, and be steadfast in the spiritual affection of truth, unless he undergoes temptations, so temptations are now treated of in what is written to the angel of the church in Pergamum. From this it appears in what order the things follow that are taught under the names of the seven churches. [2] It is said “To the angel of the church, write,” and not, To the church, because by “angel” is signified Divine truth, which makes the church; for Divine truth teaches how man is to live that he may become a church.

On this account they desire that the term “angel” should be understood spiritually, that is, in a sense abstracted from persons, and as meaning Divine truths. By Divine truth is meant at the same time Divine good, because these proceed from the Lord united (see Heaven and Hell, n. 133–140). [3] And as Divine truth proceeding from the Lord constitutes the angel, by “angel” in the Word in the highest sense is meant the Lord himself, as in Isaiah: The angel of the faces of Jehovah delivered them, in his love and his pity he redeemed them, and took them up, and carried them all the days of eternity (Isa. 63:9). In Moses: The angel who hath redeemed me from all evil, bless them (Gen. 48:16). I send an angel before thee to keep thee in the way; take ye heed of his faces, for my name is in the midst of him (Exod. 23:20–23). [4] As the Lord in respect to Divine truth is called an “angel,” so also Divine truths are meant by “angels” in the spiritual sense, as in the following passages: The son of man shall send his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that cause stumbling. In the consummation of the age the angels shall come forth and sever the wicked out of the midst of the just (Matt. 13:41, 49)."

Jesus said, After this ye shall see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the son of man (John 1:51). In these passages, in the spiritual sense, by “angels” Divine truths and not angels are meant. So when it is here said that, in the consummation of the age, “the angels are to gather out all things that cause stumbling,” “are to sever the wicked from the midst of the just,” “are to gather together the elect from the four winds with a great sound of a trumpet,” and that “the son of man with the angels is to sit upon a throne of glory,” it is not meant that angels, together with the Lord, are to do these things, but that the Lord alone will do them by means of his Divine truths; for angels have no power of themselves, but all power is the Lord’s through his Divine truth (see Heaven and Hell, n. 230–233). That “ye shall see the angels of God ascending and descending upon the son of man,” means the like, namely, that Divine truths should be in him and from him. 130b.

That this is so will also be seen in what follows. [6] That by “angels” are meant Divine truths which are from the Lord is clearly manifest in David: Jehovah maketh his angels winds, and his ministers a flaming fire (Ps. 104:4); by which words are signified Divine truth and Divine good; for the “wind” of Jehovah in the Word signifies Divine truth, and his “fire” Divine good (as can be seen from what is shown in Arcana Coelestia, as that the “wind of the nostrils” of Jehovah is Divine truth, n. 8286; that the “four winds” are all things of truth and good, n. 3708, 9642, 9668; consequently “to breathe” in the Word signifies the state of the life of faith, n. 9281; from which it is evident what is signified by Jehovah’s “breathing” into the nostrils of Adam (Gen. 2:7); by the Lord’s “breathing” upon his disciples (John 20:22); and by these words, “The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the voice thereof, but knowest not whence it cometh” (John 3:8); concerning which see n. 96, 97, 9229, 9281; and also n. 1119, 3886, 3887, 3889, 3892, 3893; that “flaming fire” is Divine love, and therefore Divine good, see Heaven and Hell, n. 133–140, 566–568; and above, n. 68).

These things may also be found explained as to the spiritual sense, in New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine, n. 1.) [8] Because by “angels” in the Word Divine truths are signified, therefore the men through whom Divine truths are made known are sometimes called “angels” in the Word, as in Malachi: The priest’s lips ought to guard knowledge, and they shall seek the law at his mouth, because he is the angel of Jehovah (Mal. 2:7). he is said to be the “angel of Jehovah,” because he teaches Divine truth; not that he is the angel of Jehovah, but the Divine truth that he teaches is. Moreover, it is known in the church that no one has Divine truth from himself. “Lips” also here signify the doctrine of truth, and “law” Divine truth itself. (That “lips” signify the doctrine of truth, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 1286, 1288; and that “law” signifies Divine truth itself, see n. 3382, 7463.) [9] From this it is that John the Baptist also is called an angel: Jesus said, This is he of whom it is written, Behold, I send mine angel before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee (Luke 7:27). John is called an “angel,” because by him, in the spiritual sense, is signified the Word, which is Divine truth, in like manner as by Elias (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 7643, 9372, and what is signified; this is what is meant by the persons mentioned in the Word, see n. 665, 1097, 1361, 3147, 3670, 3881, 4208, 4281, 4288, 4292, 4307, 4500, 6304, 7048, 7439, 8588, 8788, 8806, 9229)."

The angels not only know that this is so, but they also perceive it. The man who believes that nothing of faith is from himself, but that all faith is from God, also knows this, indeed, but he does not perceive it. That nothing of faith is from man, but all faith is from God, is the same as saying that nothing of truth that has life is from man, but all truth is from God, for truth is of faith and faith is of truth. 131a. These things saith he that hath the sharp two-edged sword, signifies the Lord, who alone combats in temptation. This is evident from the signification of “long sword” or “sword [romphaeae seu gladii], ” as meaning truth combating against falsity, and in the opposite sense, falsity combating against truth. It is said to be “sharp two-edged,” because it pierces on both sides. Because this is signified by “the long sword,” dispersion of falsities is also signified by it, and also temptation. That it signifies dispersion of falsities, see above (n. 73). It signifies temptation, because in what is written to the angel of this church temptations are treated of. Moreover, “the long sword” also signifies temptation, because temptation is a combat of truth against falsity and of falsity against truth. (That spiritual temptation is such combat, see Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, n. 187–201.) By “these things saith he that hath the sharp long sword with two edges” is meant that the Lord alone combats in temptations, because in the preceding chapter (verse 16) it was said that: Out of the mouth of the son of man, walking in the midst of the seven lamp stands, a sharp two-edged long sword was seen going forth (Rev. 1:10). and by the “Son of man” is meant the Lord in respect to Divine truth (as may be seen above, n. 63).

Thus in Matthew: Jesus said that he came not to send peace on earth, but a sword (Matt. 10:34). Here by “sword” is meant the combat of temptation. It was so said, because men at that time were in falsities, and the Lord uncovered interior truths, and only by combats from such truths can falsities be cast out.

By “purse” and “wallet” spiritual knowledges, thus truths, are signified; “garments” signify what is their own; and by “sword” combat is signified.

The consummation of the age, which is here treated of, is the last time of the church, when falsities are to prevail. “To fall by the edge of the sword” denotes that truth will be destroyed by falsity; “nations” here are evils and “Jerusalem” is the church. [7] In Isaiah: I will make a man more rare than fine gold. Everyone that is found shall be thrust through; and everyone gathered in shall fall by the sword (Isa. 13:12, 15). “A man who is rare” for those that are in truths; “to be thrust through” and “to fall by the sword” means to be consumed by falsity.

Behold, the prophets say, Ye shall not see the sword, neither shall ye have famine. By sword and by famine shall the prophets be consumed. If I go forth into the field, behold the slain with the sword; and if I enter into the city, then behold the sickness of famine (Jer. 14:13–18). Both these passages treat of the vastation of the church in respect to truth; “prophets” are those who teach truths; and “the sword that consumes them” is falsity combating and destroying; “the field” is the church; “the city” is doctrine; “the slain with the sword in the field” are those in the church with whom truths are destroyed; “the famine” that is in the city is dearth of all truth in doctrine. [10] In the same: They have denied Jehovah when they have said, It is not he; neither shall evil come upon us; neither shall we see sword and famine (Jer. 5:12). The young men shall die by the sword; and their sons and their daughters shall die by famine (Jer. 11:22). “Young men” are those who are in truths, and in the abstract, truths themselves; “to die by the sword” is to be destroyed by falsities; “sons and daughters” are the knowledges of truth and good; “famine” is a dearth of these.

[12] In Ezekiel: The sword is without, and pestilence and famine within; he that is in the field shall die with the sword; and he that is in the city, famine and pestilence shall devour him (Ezek. 7:15). “The sword” is the destruction of truth; “pestilence” consequent extermination; and “famine” complete dearth. Similarly in other places (as in Jeremiah 21:7; 29:17, 18; 34:17). [13] In Zechariah: Woe to the shepherd of nought forsaking the flock; a sword upon his arm, and upon his right eye; his arm in drying up shall dry up, and his right eye in growing dim shall grow dim (Jer. 11:17). “A sword upon the arm” is the destruction of the voluntary in respect to good; “a sword upon the right eye” is the destruction of the intellectual in respect to truth; that all good and all truth are to perish is signified by “the arm in drying up shall dry up; and the right eye in growing dim shall grow dim.” [14] In Isaiah: Thus shall ye say to your lord, Fear not for the words that thou hast heard, wherewith the lads of the king of Asshur have blasphemed Jehovah. Behold, I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land. And Senacherib, king of Asshur, returned; and it came to pass, when he bowed himself in the house of Nisroch his god, his two sons smote him with the sword (Isa. 37:6, 7, 37, 38).

[17] That “sword” signifies falsity destroying truth is manifest in David: The sons of man are set on fire; their teeth are spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword (Ps. 57:4). Behold, they belch out with their mouth, swords are in their lips (Ps. 59:7). Workers of iniquity sharpen their tongues like a sword; they hurl their arrow with a bitter word (Ps. 64:3).

Such things are signified by “sword” by reason also of appearance in the spiritual world. When spiritual combats take place there, which are combats of truth against falsity and of falsity against truth, various weapons of war, as swords, spears, shields, and the like are seen; not that the combats are maintained by these, but they are mere appearances, representative of spiritual combats. When falsities are fiercely combating truths, there sometimes appears from heaven the brightness or flashing of a sword vibrating every way, and causing great terror, by which those who are combating from falsities are dispersed.

By the “tree of life” is signified celestial love, which is love to the Lord; by “cherubim” a guard; by the “flame of a sword turning every way” the terrific driving off and rejecting of all who are in falsities; the “east of Eden” is where the Lord’s presence is in celestial love; by these words, therefore, is signified that every approach to the acknowledgement of the Lord alone is closed to him who does not live a life of love. That “sword” signifies falsity is clearly evident in Ezekiel, where it is said of the prince of Tyre: They shall unsheathe the swords upon the beauty of thy wisdom (Ezek. 28:7). “The prince of Tyre” signifies intelligence from the knowledges of truth; because that is extinguished by falsities it is said that they should unsheathe their swords “upon wisdom,” which could not have been said unless by “swords” falsities were meant. 132. Verse 13. I know thy works, signifies love and faith, as is made evident from what was shown above (n. 98 and 116). 133. And where thou dwellest, signifies amongst whom he now lives.

This is evident from the signification of “where the throne is,” as being where reigns, for “throne” signifies sovereignty; also from the signification of “satan,” as being the hells where and whence are all falsities (of which above, n. 120). “Thrones” are mentioned in many passages of the Word, and in the spiritual sense they signify judgment from Divine truths, and in the highest sense the Lord’s spiritual kingdom, where his Divine truth is received more than his Divine good (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 2129, 5313, 5315, 6397, 8625). But as “throne” is here mentioned in a contrary sense, showing this by passages from the Word will here be omitted. It will be shown in what follows. 135. And thou holdest my name, signifies the acknowledgment of the Divine in the human of the Lord, as well as all things of love to him and faith in him. This is evident from what has been shown above about the signification of the “name” of Jehovah, Lord, and Jesus Christ (n. 102). By the Lord’s “name” in the Word is meant primarily the acknowledgment of the Divine in his human, because all things of love and faith are from that; for Divine goods which are of love, and Divine truths which are of faith, proceed from no other source than from the Lord alone; and these cannot flow in with man unless he thinks of the Lord’s Divine at the same time that he thinks of his human; nor is his Divine separate from the human, but it is in the human (as may be seen above, n. 10, 26, 49, 52, 77, 97, 113, 114). I can aver, from all experience of the spiritual world, that no one is in the truths of faith and in the goods of love except he who thinks of the Lord’s Divine at the same time that he thinks of his human; as also that no one is spiritual, or is an angel, unless he has been in that thought and consequent acknowledgment in the world.

This is evident from the signification of “not denying,” as being, in reference to faith, to be constant (for he who is constant does not deny); and from the signification of “faith,” as being truths, since truth is of faith and faith is of truth. There are two things that constitute man’s spiritual life, love and faith. Every good has reference to love, and every truth to faith; but truth with man is of faith only so far as it is derived from the good of love; since every truth is from good, for it is the form of good, and all good is the esse of truth. For good, when it is so formed as to appear to the mind, and through the mind in speech, is called truth; therefore it is said that good is the esse of truth. (But more may be seen on this subject in Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, n. 11–27, likewise 28–35, 54–64, 108–122.) 137. Even in the days wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr who was slain among you, signifies in that time and state in which all are hated who openly acknowledge the Divine human of the Lord.

This lies concealed in hatred; he, therefore, who hates the neighbor, when in the other life external bonds are removed from him, is continually breathing the murder of some one.

That the Lord loved a certain one named Lazarus, whom also he raised from the dead, is manifest in John (chap. 11:3, 5, 36) and that he reclined with the Lord at table, (chap. 12), on which account he was called “Lazarus,” by the Lord, who longed to be fed with the crumbs that fell from the rich man’s table, whereby is signified a longing for truths from spiritual affection (as shown above, n. 118).

When they hear these truths they turn away, for they cannot deny them; but they are offended, and breathe forth the murder of all who openly acknowledge the Lord, as was just said, because hatred is inrooted in them (see above, n. 114).

In John: Jesus said, If the world hateth you, know that it hated me before it hated you. If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you.

Here, therefore, by “Balaam” those are meant who have been illuminated in respect to the understanding, and who teach truths, and yet love to destroy by craft those who are of the church.

And in Joshua: Balaam also, the son of Beor, the diviner, did the sons of Israel slay with the sword upon their slain (Joshua 13:22). That he was called by Balak, king of Moab, to curse the people of Israel, see Num. 22:5, 6, 16, 17; Deut. 23:3, 4; but that Jehovah prevented this, and granted him to speak prophetically, Num. 22:9, 10, 12, 20; 23:5, 16; the prophecies which he uttered may be seen Num. 23:7–15, 18–24; 24:5–9, 16–19, 20–24; all which things are truths, because it is said that: Jehovah put a word into his mouth (Num. 23:5, 12, 16).

The angel with the drawn sword signifies Divine truth illustrating and combating against falsity (see above, n. 131a). Therefore that “the ass turned aside three times out of the way” signifies that the understanding when illustrated did not agree with the thought of the soothsayer; this also is meant by what the angel said to Balaam: Behold, I went forth to withstand thee, because thy way is evil before me (Num. 22:32). By “way,” in the spiritual sense of the Word, is signified that which a man thinks from intention (see Heaven and Hell, n. 479, 534, 590; and in Last Judgment, n. 48). That he was withheld from the thought and intention of using enchantments by the fear of death is manifest from what the angel said to him: Unless the ass had turned aside before me, surely now I had even slain thee (Num. 22:33). [5] It sounded to Balaam as if the ass spoke to him, yet she did not speak, but the speech was heard as if from her. That such was the case has often been shown me by living experience; it has been granted me to hear horses seemingly speaking, when yet the speech was not from them, but was seemingly from them. This actually occurred in Balaam’s case, that the story might be so related in the Word for the sake of the internal sense in every particular of it. That sense describes how the Lord protects those who are in truths and goods, that they may not be harmed by those who speak from seeming illumination, and yet have the disposition and intention to lead astray. He who believes that Balaam could harm the sons of Israel by enchantments is much deceived; for enchantments could have availed nothing against them; this Balaam himself confessed when he said:"

[6] It is to be noted, moreover, that a man can be in illustration in respect to the understanding, and yet in evil in respect to the will; for the intellectual faculty is separated from the voluntary with all who are not regenerated, and only with those who are regenerated do they act as one; for it is the office of the understanding to know, to think, and to speak truths, but of the will to will the things that are understood, and from the will, or from the love, to do them. The divorcement of the two is clearly manifest with evil spirits; when these turn themselves towards good spirits, they, too, understand truths, and also acknowledge them, almost as if they were illustrated; but as soon as they turn themselves away from good spirits, they return to the love of their will and see nothing of truth, and even deny the things they have heard (see Heaven and Hell, n. 153, 424, 455). [7] To be able to have the understanding illustrated is granted to man, for the sake of reformation; for in man’s will every evil resides, both that into which he is born and that into which he introduces himself; and the will cannot be corrected unless man knows, and by the understanding acknowledges, truths and goods, and also falsities and evils; in no other way can he turn away from the latter and love the former.

That Balaam counselled Balak to invite the sons of Israel to the sacrifices of his gods appears from what was shown in the preceding article, and from these words of Moses: Israel abode in Shittim, where the people began to commit whoredom with the daughters of Moab; for he called9 the people unto the sacrifices of their gods; and the people did eat, and bowed down to their gods. Especially did the people join themselves to Baal-peor; therefore the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Israel. And those that were slain were four and twenty thousand (Num. 25:1–3, 9). It was among the statutes where sacrifices were instituted that some part of the sacrifices, especially of the thank-offerings, should be burnt from the altar, and some part eaten in the holy place. The “sacrifices” themselves signified worship from love and faith, and the “eating” of them signified appropriation of the good thereof. (That “sacrifices” signified all things of worship from the good of love and faith, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 923, 6905, 8680, 8936, 10042; and “eating” the appropriation of goods, n. 10109.) As the eating of things sanctified to Jehovah signified the appropriation of good, so the eating of the sacrifices offered to the gods of the nations, and which were called “idol sacrifices,” signified the appropriation of evil. [2] That to “commit whoredom,” in the spiritual sense, signifies to become imbued with falsities, so also to falsify truths, can be seen from many passages in the Word. The same was signified by the whoredoms of the sons of Israel with the daughters of Moab; for all historical parts of the Word involve spiritual things and signify them (as can be seen from the explanations of Genesis and Exodus, called Arcana Coelestia). And as the eating of idol sacrifices by the sons of Israel and their whoredoms with the daughters of Moab involved such things (for what things signify they involve), therefore it was commanded that the heads of the people should be hung up to Jehovah before the sun; and for the same reason Phinehas the son of Eleazar thrust through a man of Israel and a"

Such punishments and such plagues merely because of the eating of idol sacrifices, and committing whoredom with the women of another nation, would never have been commanded to be done, unless they had involved heinous offenses against heaven and the church, which do not appear in the literal sense of the Word, but only in its spiritual sense. The heinous offenses involved were the profanation at once of the goods and of the truths of the church, and this, as has been said above, was the appropriation of evil and falsity. 141b. [3] That adulteries and whoredoms involve such things is evident from numerous passages in the Word, where they are recounted, which show clearly that they signify the adulterations of good and the falsifications of truth, as in the following. In Ezekiel: Jerusalem, thou hast trusted in thy beauty, and hast committed whoredom because of thy renown, so that thou hast poured out thy whoredoms on everyone that passed by. Thou has committed whoredom with the sons of Egypt thy neighbors, great of flesh, and hast multiplied thy whoredom. Thou hast committed whoredom with the sons of Asshur, when there was no satiety to thee, with whom thou committedst whoredom. Thou hast multiplied thy whoredom even to Chaldea, the land of traffic. An adulterous woman receiveth strangers instead of her husband. All give reward to their harlots,10 but thou hast given reward to all thy lovers, and hast rewarded them that they may come unto thee on every side in thy whoredoms. Wherefore, O harlot, hear the word of Jehovah (Ezek. 16:15, 26, 28–29, 32–33, 35 seq.). Who cannot see that by “whoredoms” here are not meant whoredoms in the usual natural sense? For the church in which all the truths of the Word have been falsified is treated of; this is what is meant by “whoredoms”; for “whoredoms” in the spiritual sense, or spiritual whoredoms, are no other than falsifications of truth. “Jerusalem” here is the church; the “sons of Egypt,” with whom she committed whoredom, are knowledges of every kind, perversely applied to confirm falsities; the “sons of Asshur” are reasonings from falsities; “Chaldea,” the land of traffic, is the profanation of"

One committed whoredom while subject to me, and chose for lovers the Assyrians her neighbors; she bestowed her whoredoms upon them yet she hath not left her whoredoms in Egypt. The other hath corrupted her love more than she, and her whoredoms above the whoredoms of her sister; she increased her whoredoms, she loved the Chaldeans; the sons of Babel came to her to the bed of loves, and they defiled her with their whoredom (Ezek. 23:2–3, 5–8, 11, 14, 16–17 seq.). here also by “whoredoms” are in like manner meant spiritual whoredoms, as is evident from every particular. “Two women, the daughters of one mother, are the two churches, the Israelitish and the Jewish; “whoredoms” with “the Egyptians,” “the Assyrians,” “the Chaldeans,” signify the like as above; “the bed of loves with the sons of Babel” is the profanation of good. [5] In Jeremiah: Thou hast committed whoredoms with many companions, thou hast profaned the land with thy whoredoms, and with thine evil. Hast thou seen that which backsliding Israel hath done? She hath gone away upon every high mountain, and under every green tree, and there committeth whoredom. Perfidious Judah also hath gone away and committed whoredom, so that by the voice of her whoredom she hath profaned the land; she hath committed adultery with stone and with wood (Jer. 3:1–2, 6, 8–9). “Israel” is the church that is in truth, “Judah” the church that is in good, for they represented these two churches. The falsifications of truth are signified by the “whoredoms of Israel,” and the adulterations of good by “the whoredoms of Judah.” “To go away upon every high mountain and under every green tree and to commit whoredom” is to seek after all the knowledges of good and"

When I fed them to the full they committed whoredom and came by troops to the house of the harlot (Jer. 5:1, 7). To “run to and fro through the streets, and to seek in the broad places of Jerusalem,” is to see and explore the doctrinals of that church; for “Jerusalem” is the church, and “streets” and “broad places” are doctrinals. “If ye have found a man, if there be any doing judgment, seeking truth,” means whether there be any truth in the church. “When I fed them to the full they committed whoredom,” means that when truths were revealed to them they falsified them. Such a church, in respect to doctrine, is the “house of the harlot,” into which they “came by troops.” [7] In the same: Thine adulteries, and thy neighings, the lewdness of thy whoredom, thine abominations on the hills in the field have I seen. Woe unto thee, O Jerusalem; thou wilt not be made clean (Jer. 13:27). “Neighings” are profanations of truth, because a “horse” signifies the intellectual where there is truth; “the hills in the field” are goods of truth in the church, which have been perverted.

[9] In Moses: Your sons shall be shepherds in the wilderness forty years, and shall bear your12 whoredoms even till their carcasses are consumed in the wilderness (Num. 14:33). The sons of Israel did not bear whoredoms and were not for that reason consumed in the wilderness, but because they spurned heavenly truths, as is evident from this, that it was so said to them because they wished not to enter into the land of Canaan, but to return to Egypt; “the land of Canaan” signifies heaven and the church, with the truths thereof; and “Egypt” signifies the same falsified and turned into magic.

Your daughters commit whoredom, and your daughters-in-law commit adultery (Hosea 4:7, 10–11, 13). “Whoredom, wine, and new wine,” are falsified truths; “whoredom” falsification itself; “wine” interior falsity; “new wine” exterior falsity; “daughters who commit whoredom” are the goods of truth perverted; “daughters-in-law who commit adultery” are evils conjoined with falsities therefrom.

Such spheres correspond to all the prohibited degrees (of which, see Lev. 20:11–21) with a difference according to the application of truths to falsities and the conjunction of falsities with evils, especially with evils that gush out of the love of self (of which more may be seen in Heaven and Hell, n. 384–386). 142.

This is evident from what was said and shown above (n. 107), where similar words occur. To which this is to be added: that those who separate truth from good, or faith from charity, turn away from themselves all influx of heaven into the goods they do, in consequence of which their goods are not good; for heaven flows in, that is, the Lord through heaven, into the good of man’s love; he, therefore, that rejects the good of charity from the doctrine of the church, and receives instead only those things that are called matters of faith, is shut out of heaven; truths with such have no life; and it is the life of truth, which is good, that conjoins, but not truth without life, or faith without charity.

This delight, which is meant by “manna,” was unknown to the sons of Israel, because they were in corporeal delight more than other nations, and those who are in that delight are altogether incapable of knowing anything of heavenly delight. (That the sons of Israel were such, see Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, n. 248.) The term “delight” is used, and the delight of love is meant, for every delight of life is of love.

But more about these matters may be seen in the explanation of chapter 16 of Exodus in Arcana Coelestia.)

This is evident from the signification of “name,” as being the quality of state (of which see Arcana Coelestia, n. 1754, 1896, 2009, 3237, 3421); here the quality of the state of the interior life, because it is said “a new name, which no one knoweth except he that receiveth,” for the quality of the state of the interior life is wholly unknown to those who are not in the interior life. Those are in the interior life who are in love to the Lord, and none are in love to the Lord except those who acknowledge the Divine in his human (that to love the Lord is to live according to his precepts, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 10143, 10153, 10578, 10645, 10829). Interior life is the spiritual life, in which the angels of heaven are; but the exterior life is the natural life, in which are all who are not in heaven. With those, moreover, who live according to the precepts of the Lord and acknowledge the Divine in his human, the interior mind is opened, and man then becomes spiritual; but those who do not so live, and do not acknowledge the Lord, remain natural. (That to all who are not in heavenly love the state of the interior or spiritual life is unknown, see Heaven and Hell, n. 395–414; and in Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, n. 105, 238.) [2] That “name” in the Word signifies quality of state is evident from many passages there, some of which I will here cite in confirmation. Thus in Isaiah: Lift up your eyes on high and see; who hath created these: he that leadeth out the host in number; that calleth them all by name (Isa. 40:26). “his calling them all by name” is knowing the quality of all, and giving to them according to the state of love and faith with them. In John the meaning is similar: He that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. To him the porter openeth, and the sheep hear his voice; and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out (John 10:2–3)."

For Jacob my servant’s sake, and Israel my chosen, I have called thee by thy name, when thou didst not know me (Isa. 45:3–4). “I have called thee by thy name” means that he knew the quality of the state of the church; for “Jacob” and “Israel” are the church, “Jacob” the external church, and “Israel” the internal. [3] In the same: Israel, if thou hadst hearkened to my commandments, his name should not have been cut off nor destroyed from before me (Isa. 48:18–19). “The name being cut off and destroyed from before Jehovah” denotes the quality of the state by which conjunction is effected, which state is the spiritual state of him who is of the church signified by “Israel.” Again in the same prophet: Jehovah hath called me from the womb, from the bowels of my mother doth he make mention of my name (Isa. 49:1). here “making mention of the name” is knowing the quality. In the same: For Zion’s sake I will not be still, and for Jerusalem’s sake I will not be quiet. And the nations shall see thy righteousness, and all kings thy glory; and thou shalt be called by a new name, which the mouth of Jehovah shall utter (Isa. 62:1, 2).

[4] In Moses: Moses said unto Jehovah, Thou hast said, I know thee by thy name. And Jehovah said unto Moses, This word also that thou hast spoken I will do, for I know thee by name (Exod. 33:12, 17). “His knowing Moses by name” is knowing his quality. In Revelation: Thou hast a few names in Sardis which have not defiled their garments. He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white garments, and I will confess his name before my Father. He that overcometh, I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, and my new name (Rev. 3:4, 5, 12). It can be seen that “name” here signifies the quality of state in respect to the good of love and the truth of faith. In another place: Whose names have not been written in the book of life (Rev. 13:8; 17:8). “Names written in the book of life” are the quality of all things of man’s love and faith, the all things of his spiritual life. In another place: They shall see the face of God and the lamb, and his name shall be in their forehead (Rev. 22:4). “His name in their forehead” is a state of love, for “forehead” corresponds to love, and therefore signifies love.

Verse 18. And to the angel of the church in Thyatira write, signifies those of the church with whom the internal and the external, or the spiritual and natural man, make one. This is evident from what is written to this angel understood in the internal sense, which treats of the conjunction of the internal or spiritual man with the external or natural man, or concerning those of the church in whom these are conjoined. In every man there is an internal and an external; his internal is what is called the spiritual man, the external what is called the natural man. When man is born, the external or natural man is first opened; and afterwards, as he grows up and is perfected in intelligence and wisdom, the internal or spiritual man is opened. The external or natural man is opened by such things as man derives from the world, while the internal or spiritual man is opened by such things as he derives from heaven; for the external or natural man is formed for receiving such things as are in the world, but the internal or spiritual man for receiving such things as are in heaven. The things in the world, for receiving which the external or natural man is formed, have reference, in general, to all things of civil and moral life; while the things in heaven, for receiving which the internal or spiritual man is formed, have reference, in general, to all things of love and faith."

But those with whom the internal is closed are not men of the church; for the church with man is formed through communication with heaven; and there is no communication with heaven unless man’s internal is opened by its proper means, all which have reference, as was said above, to love and faith. It is to be known, moreover, that with the man of the church, that is, the man who has been regenerated by the Lord by means of truths called truths of faith and by means of a life according to them, the internal and external or the spiritual and natural man are conjoined, and that this conjunction is effected by correspondences. (The nature of correspondences, and therefore the nature of the conjunction effected by them can be seen from what is shown about them in Arcana Coelestia, and cited from that work the Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, n. 261.) [3] Now since a man does not become a man of the church until his internal or spiritual man has been opened and until this has been conjoined with the external or natural man, those within the church in whom this conjunction is effected are now treated of; for (as was said above, n. 20) by “the seven churches” are not meant seven churches, but all in general who are of the Lord’s church; consequently what is written to the angel of each church treats of such things as constitute the church; here, therefore, that is, “to the angel of the church of Thyatira,” the internal and external are treated of, and the conjunction of the two in those of the church. (But as hitherto it has not been known that these two are actually in man, and that they must be opened and conjoined that man may be a man of the church; and as these things cannot be made clear in a few words, therefore they have been treated of in Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, n. 36–53, 179–182.) 151.

For everything of love and faith, which two constitute the church, proceeds from the Lord’s Divine human, and not immediately from the Divine itself; for what proceeds immediately from his Divine itself, does not fall into any thought and affection of man, nor consequently into faith and love, because it is far above them. This can be seen from the fact that man is not able to think of the Divine itself apart from the human form, except as he thinks of nature, as it were, in things least. Thought that is not determined to a certain figure is diffused in every direction, and what is diffused is dissipated. This has been given me to know most especially from those in the other life who are from the Christian world, who have thought only of the Father, and not of the Lord, that they make nature in its minutest parts their God, and finally fall away from all idea of God, consequently from the idea and faith in anything of heaven and the church. [2] It is otherwise with those who have thought of God under the human form; these have all their ideas determined to the Divine, nor do their thoughts, like the thoughts of those mentioned before, wander in every direction. And as the Divine under the human form, is the Lord’s Divine human, therefore the Lord bends and determines their thoughts and affections to himself. This, because it is the primary truth of the church, unceasingly flows in out of heaven with man; consequently it is, as it were, implanted in everyone to think of the Divine under the human form, and thus to see his Divine inwardly in himself, with the exception of such as have extinguished in themselves this implanted thought (see Heaven and Hell, n. 82). From this the reason can also be seen, why all men, whatsoever after death, when they become spirits, turn themselves to their own loves, and thus why those who have worshiped the Divine under the human form turn themselves to the Lord, who appears to them as a sun above the heavens. But those who have not worshiped the Divine under the human form, turn themselves to the loves of their natural man, all of which have reference to the loves of self and the world, thus turning backwards"

[3] All who lived in ancient times and worshiped the Divine saw the Divine in thought under the human form, and hardly anyone thought of an invisible Divine; and the Divine under the human form was even then the Divine human. But as this Divine human was the Divine of the Lord in the heavens and passing through the heavens, when at length heaven became enfeebled, because men, of whom heaven is made up, from internal successively became external and thus natural, therefore it pleased the Divine itself to put on a human, and to glorify it, or make it Divine, that thus from himself he might affect all, both those who are in the spiritual world and those who are in the natural world, and might save those who acknowledge and worship his Divine in the human. [4] This is clearly stated in many passages in the Old Testament prophets, as well as in the evangelists; of these I will cite only the following in John: In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and God was the Word. All things were made through him, and without him was not anything made that hath been made. In him was life; and the life was the light of men. And that light shineth in the darkness; and the darkness apprehended it not. It was the true light, which lighteth every man coming into the world. He was in the world, but the world acknowledged him not. And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us, and we beheld his glory (John 1:1–14). It is plainly evident that the Lord in respect to the human is here meant by “the Word,” for it is said, “the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us, and we beheld his glory.” It is also evident that the Lord made his human to be Divine, for it is said, “the Word was with God and God was the Word, and this became flesh,” that is, a man. And since all Divine truth proceeds from the Lord’s Divine human, and this is his Divine in the heavens, therefore by “the Word” is also signified Divine truth; and thence he is said to be “the light which lighteth every man coming into the world.”"

That “light” is Divine truth, and “darkness” the falsities in which those are who are not in the light, see Heaven and Hell, n. 126–140, 275.) [5] That they who acknowledge the Lord and worship him from love and faith, and are not in the love of self and the love of the world, are regenerated and saved, is also taught in these words in John: As many as received him, to them gave he power to be children of God, even to them that believe in his name; which were born, not of bloods, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God (John 1:12, 13). Here “of bloods” means such as destroy love and charity. “The will of the flesh” is every evil from the love of self and love of the world, also man’s self-will, which in itself is nothing but evil; “the will of man” is falsity thence that comes from that self-will. That those who are not in these loves receive the Lord and are regenerated and saved, is meant by its being said that those who “believe in his name become children of God,” and are “born of God.” (That to “believe in the Lord’s name” is to acknowledge his Divine human and to receive love and faith from him, see above. n. 102–135. That “bloods” are the things that destroy love and charity, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 4735, 5476, 9127; that “flesh” is man’s self- will, which in itself is nothing but evil, n. 210, 215, 731, 874–876, 987, 1047, 2307, 2308, 3518, 3701, 3812, 4328, 8480, 8550, 10283, 10284, 10286, 10732; and that man’s proprium is the love of self and the love of the world, n. 694, 731, 4317, 5660.

Moreover, that all in the universe, from influx out of heaven and from revelation, worship the Divine in the human form, see Earths in the Universe, n. 98, 121, 141, 154, 158, 159, 169; likewise all angels of the higher heavens, see Heaven and Hell, n. 78–86.) [6] From this it can now be seen that everything of the church, thus also everything of heaven with men, is from the Lord’s Divine human. For this reason “the son of man,” who is the Divine human, is described in the first chapter of Revelation, by various representatives; and from that description the introductory sentences to each of the churches are taken (as may be seen above, n. 113), and what is said to this church in particular treats of this chief essential of the church, namely, the conjunction of the internal and external, or the regeneration of the man of the church; for it is said to the angel of this church, “These things saith the son of God, that hath his eyes as a flame of fire.” 152. That hath his eyes as a flame of fire, signifies Divine providence from his Divine love, also Divine wisdom and intelligence communicated to those who are in love towards him and from that in faith in him. That “eyes as a flame of fire,” means in reference to the Lord, his Divine Providence from his Divine love, see above (n. 68). This means also Divine wisdom and intelligence communicated to those who are in love towards the Lord, and from that in faith in him, because “eyes” in the Word signify in reference to man the understanding of truth, and the understanding of truth is intelligence and wisdom; consequently “eyes” signify, in reference to the Lord, Divine wisdom and intelligence proceeding from him; and what proceeds from him is communicated to angels and to men who are in love towards him and from that in faith in him. All the wisdom and intelligence that angels and men have is the Lord’s with them and not their own; and this is also well known in the church; for it is known that all good, which is of love, and all truth, which is of faith, are from God, and nothing thereof from man; and truths interiorly seen and"

From this then it is that “having his eyes as a flame of fire” also signifies the Lord’s Divine wisdom and intelligence communicated to those who are in the goods of love, and from that in faith in him. [2] “Eyes” signify the understanding, because all the sight of the eyes with men and angels is from the understanding. That all the sight of the eyes is from the understanding must sound absurd to those who are ignorant of the interior causes of things, out of which effects are presented in the body; those ignorant of these causes believe no otherwise than that the eye sees of itself, that the ear hears of itself, that the tongue tastes of itself, and that the body feels of itself; when yet it is the interior life of man, the life of his spirit, which is the life of his understanding and will, or of his thought and affection that, through the organs of the body, has sensation of the things that are in the world, and thus perceives them naturally. The whole body, with all its sensories, is merely an instrument of its soul, or of its spirit; which is also the reason that when man’s spirit is separated from the body the body has no sensation whatever, but the spirit afterwards continues to have sensation as before. (That man’s spirit sees, hears, and feels, after it is released from the body equally as before while in the body, see Heaven and Hell, n. 461–469; and on the correspondence of the understanding with the sight of the eye, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 4403–4421, 4523–4534.) With beasts, moreover, their interior life, which is also called their soul, has sensation equally through the external organs of their body, but with a difference, in that the sensation of the beast is not rational like man’s, thus is not formed from an understanding and will such as man has (see Heaven and Hell, n. 108; and Last Judgment, n. 25). [3] From this, then, it is, that by “eye” in the Word is signified the understanding of truth, or intelligence and wisdom, as may be seen from the following passages. In Isaiah:"

[4] In the same: Jehovah hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep, and hath closed your eyes; the prophets and your heads, the seers hath he covered (Isa. 29:10); where “he hath closed the eyes; the prophets and the heads, and the seers hath he covered,” is the understanding of truth. “Prophets” are those that teach truths, who are also called “heads,” because the head signifies intelligence, and are also called “seers” from the revelation of Divine truth with them.

(That “horse” signifies the intellectual, see White Horse, n. 1–5.)

In Moses: Thou shalt not take a gift, for a gift doth blind the eyes of the wise (Deut. 16:19). “To blind the eyes of the wise” is that they may not see or understand the truth. [11] In Matthew: The lamp of the body is the eye: if the eye is good the whole body is light; if the eye is evil the whole body is darkened. If therefore the light is darkness, how great is the darkness (Matt. 6:22, 23; Luke 11:34). By “eye” here is not meant the eye, but the understanding; by “the eye good” the understanding of truth; by “the eye evil” the understanding of falsity; “darkness” is falsities; “the whole body” is the whole spirit, which is wholly such as the will is and the understanding therefrom; but if it has the understanding of truth from the will of good it is an angel of light; but if it has an understanding of falsity it is a spirit of darkness.

Here also, by “eye” is not meant the eye, but the understanding thinking; by “the right eye causing to stumble” the understanding thinking evil; “plucking it out and casting it away” is not admitting such evil, but rejecting it; “having one eye” is the understanding thinking not evil, but truth only, for the understanding can think the truth; if it thinks evil it is from the will of evil. It is said “the right eye,” because “the right eye” signifies the understanding of good, and the “left eye” the understanding of truth (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 4410, 6923).

These four “living creatures” also were cherubim, for the description of them is almost like that of the cherubim in Ezekiel. So many “eyes” are ascribed to them because the Lord’s Divine providence, which is signified by “cherubim,” is his government of all things in the heavens and on the earth by Divine wisdom; for the Lord by Divine providence sees all things, disposes all things, and looks out for all things.

As what is written to the angel of this church treats of the internal of the church, which is spiritual, and its external, which is natural, that they must make one (see above, n. 150), so it is prefaced by these things respecting the Lord, from whom is everything of the church, “These things saith the son of God, that hath his eyes as a flame of fire, and his feet like unto burnished brass”; for in respect to man, “eyes” signify the internal, which is spiritual, and “feet” the external, which is natural; but in respect to the Lord, “eyes” and “feet” signify the Divine things from which are the internal and external with man. 154. Verse 19. I know thy works and charity, signifies the internal of those who are of the church. This is evident from the signification of “works,” as being the things that are of the will, or of celestial love (of which see above, n. 98), and from the signification of “charity,” as being the things that are of spiritual love. “Works and charity” signifies the internal of the church, because its internal is made up of the things that are of the will or love, and its external of the things that are of the understanding and faith. There are two loves that constitute heaven or the church, love to the Lord and love towards the neighbor, or charity; love to the Lord is called celestial love, and love toward the neighbor, which is charity, is called spiritual love.

There are two things that constitute heaven or the church with man, namely, love and faith. Love resides in man’s will, for what man loves that he also wills; but faith resides in his understanding, for what a man believes that he also thinks, and thought is of the understanding. [2] The internal of the celestial church, therefore, is to do the Lord’s commandments from the affection of the will, consequently from the love of good; while the internal of the spiritual church is to do the Lord’s commandments from the affection of the understanding, consequently from the love of truth. That doing the Lord’s commandments is loving him, he himself teaches in John (14:21, 23). The internal of the celestial church is what is meant by “works,” and the internal of the spiritual church is meant by “charity.” (But as these things cannot be explained in a few words, so as to be clearly perceived, see what is said respecting them in Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, on the will and understanding, n. 28–36; on the internal and the external man, n. 36–53; on love in general, n. 54–64; on love towards the neighbor, or charity, n. 84–107; on faith, n. 108–122; and in Heaven and Hell, where celestial love and spiritual love are treated of, n. 13–19.) 155. And ministry and faith, signifies good and truth therein. This is evident from the signification of “ministry,” as being good (of which presently); and from the signification of “faith,” as being truth. Faith signifies truth, because truth is of faith, and faith is of truth. “Ministry” signifies good, because in the Word “ministry” is predicated of good. For this reason the function of Aaron, of his sons, and of the Levites, and the priestly function in general, was called a “ministry.” For the same reason, “ministering” to Jehovah, or to the Lord, means to worship him from the good of love.

[2] That “ministry” and “ministering” in the Word are predicated of the good of love can be seen from the following passages. In David: Jehovah makes his angels spirits, his ministers a flaming fire (Ps. 104:4). Jehovah’s “making his angels spirits” means that they are recipients of Divine truth (see above, n. 130a). “Making his ministers a flaming fire” means that they are recipients of Divine good for “flaming fire” signifies the good of love (see above, n. 68). From this it is clear that by “ministers” those who are in the good of love are meant. [3] In the same: Bless Jehovah, all ye his hosts; ye ministers of his that do his will (Ps. 103:21). Those are called “hosts of Jehovah” who are in truths (see n. 3448, 7236, 7988, 8019), and “ministers” those who are in goods; therefore it is said, “that do his will.” Doing the Lord’s will is acting from the good of love; for all good has reference to the will, as all truth has to the understanding. [4] In Isaiah: Ye shall be called the priests of Jehovah, the ministers of our God (Isa. 61:6). Priests are called “ministers” because they represented the Lord in respect to the good of love; those, therefore, who are in the good of love are called “priests” in the Word (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 2015,"

And in Jeremiah: Then shall my covenant become void with the Levites the priests, my ministers (Jer. 33:21). (That Aaron represented the Lord in respect to the good of love, see Arcana Coelestia, 9806, 9946, 10017; likewise priests in general, n. 2015, 6148; consequently by “priesthood” in the Word the Divine good of the Lord’s Divine love is signified, n. 9806, 9809.) [5] There are two kingdoms into which the whole heaven is divided, in one of which are the angels who are in the good of celestial love, in the other the angels who are in the good of spiritual love, or in charity. The Lord’s celestial kingdom is called his “priesthood,” the spiritual kingdom his “royalty” (see Heaven and Hell, n. 24, 226). “Ministry” is predicated of those in the celestial kingdom, and “service” of those in the spiritual kingdom. From this it is clear what is meant in the following passages by “ministering” and “minister,” and by “serving” and “servant”: Jesus said to the disciples, Whosoever would be great let him be your minister; and whosoever would be first, let him be your servant; as the son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister (Matt. 20:26–28; 23:11–12; Mark 9:35; Luke 22:24–27). Jesus said, If any man will minister to me let him follow me; then where I am, there shall also my minister be; yea, if any man will minister to me, him will my Father honor (John 12:26). Jesus said, Blessed are those servants whom the Lord when he cometh shall find watching; I say unto you, that he shall gird himself, and make them to recline to eat, and he will come forth and minister to them (Luke 12:37)."

Because “ministering” is predicated of the good of love, “the sons of the alien” are said “to minister to Jehovah,” and “to love him”; and of the Lord himself it is said that “he would minister.” From all this it can now be seen that by “ministry” is signified everything that is done from the good of love, thus the good of love. 156. And thine endurance, signifies conjunction with the external, and consequent combat. This is evident from the signification of “endurance,” as being in respect to those who are in the internal and the external of the church (who are here treated of), the conjunction of the internal with the external, and consequent combat. This is signified by “endurance,” because the conjunction of the internal with the external, or of the spiritual man with the natural, is effected by temptations; without these the two are not conjoined; therefore the combat by which that conjunction is effected, since man then suffers and endures, is signified by “endurance.” (That the internal man is conjoined with the external by temptations, which are spiritual combats, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 10685; and Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, n. 190, 194, 199.) 157. And thy works, and the last to be more than the first, signifies the externals that are therefrom. This is evident from the signification of “works,” as being externals in which are internals; for “works” are ultimate effects, in which internals are presented together, and are in a series therein; there they form their ultimate and fullness. The things that are of the thought and the will, and spiritually speaking, those that are of love and of faith, are called internal; these are in works, consequently “works” are ultimates. (That the interior things, which are of the mind, successively flow into external things, even into the extreme or ultimate, and that they have existence and subsistence therein, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 634, 6239, 6465, 9215–9216; that in the ultimate they also form what is simultaneous, in what series, see n. 5897, 6451, 8603, 10099; that the whole man is in his deeds or works, and that what"

[2] To this I will add an arcanum not yet known. After death, man’s spirit appears in a human form according to the life of his affection while in the world; in a beautiful form if he lived a life of heavenly love; in an unbeautiful form if he lived a life of worldly love. It is from this that angels are forms of love and charity; yet their form is not so beautiful from the affection of thought and will alone as from the affection of these expressed in deeds or works; for deeds or works from the affection of the will and thought, or of love and faith, are what constitute the outward aspect of the spirit, thus the beauty of his face, body, and speech. The reason for this is, that as the interiors terminate in deeds or works as into their extremes, so do they terminate in the outward form of the body. For it is well known that everything of man’s will terminates in the extremes of his body. Any part of the body in which the will does not terminate is not a part of the body; as is evident from the actions of the body, even the least of them; for these all flow from the impulse of the will and are manifested in the extremes of the body (see Heaven and Hell, n. 59–60; and Last Judgment, n. 30–31). [3] The same is manifest from this, that man’s spirit is altogether as his will is; not as his will is that does not go forth into act when it can (that will is nothing but thought in which there is an appearance of willing), but as the actual will is, which has no other desire than to act; this will is the same with man’s love; in accordance with this is the whole spirit and its human form. (That the will or love is the spirit itself, see above, n. 105; and Heaven and Hell, n. 479.) On this account it is so often said in the Word that man ought “to do the Lord’s commandments,” and that he will be recompensed according to his “doings,” that is, according to the love in deeds, but not according to the love without deeds, when doing is possible. [4] It is said, “I know thy works, and the last to be more than the first”; by “the last being more than the first” is meant that the"

In man the conatus is the will, and the motion therefrom is action. [5] From what has been explained in this verse it can be seen in what order the conjunction of the internal with the external in the man of the church is described, namely, the internal by “I know thy works and charity”; the good of the internal and its truth by “ministry and faith”; the conjunction of the internal with the external by “endurance”; and the externals therefrom by “I know thy works, and the last to be more than the first.” That such things are involved in these words no one can see from the sense of the letter, but only from the spiritual sense which is within the literal sense. 158. Verse 20. But I have against thee a few things, signifies that heed should be taken, as is evident from what follows, for it is there told of what things heed should be taken. 159. That thou sufferest the woman Jezebel, signifies the delight of the love of self and of the world. This is evident from the signification of “the woman Jezebel,” as being the church wholly perverted; for “woman” in the Word signifies the church (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 252, 253, 749, 770, 6014, 7337, 8994), here the church perverted. And as all perversion of the church springs from those two loves, namely, from the love of self and the love of the world, “Jezebel” signifies the delight of these loves. The church in which these loves reign is called “the woman Jezebel,” because Jezebel the wife of Ahab represented in the Word the delight of these loves, and the perversion of the church thereby.

[2] That Jezebel the wife of Ahab represented what has been said will be seen presently; but something shall first be said about the delights of loves. Every man is such as his love is, and every delight of his life is from his love; for whatever favors his love he perceives as delightful, and whatever is adverse to his love he perceives as undelightful; consequently it is the same whether it be said that man is such as his love is, or such as his life’s delight is. Those, therefore, who are loves of self and of the world, that is, they, with whom these loves reign, have no other life’s delight or no other life than infernal life. For these loves, or the life’s delights from them that are permanent, turn all their thoughts and intentions to self and the world; and so far as they turn them to self and to the world, they so far immerse them in man’s proprium [what is his own], which he has by inheritance, thus at the same time in evils of every kind; and so far as man’s thoughts and intentions are turned to his inherited proprium, which in itself is nothing but evil, so far are they turned away from heaven. For man’s interiors, which are of his mind, that is, of his thought and intention, or of his understanding and will, are actually turned to his own loves, that is, downward to self where the love of self and its delights reign, and outward, that is, away from heaven towards the world, where the love of the world and its delights reign. It is otherwise when man loves God above all things, and his neighbor as himself; then the Lord turns the interiors which are of man’s mind, or of his thought and intention, to himself, thus turning them away from man’s proprium, and elevating them; and this without man’s knowing anything about it. From this it is that man’s spirit, which is the man himself, after its release from the body is actually turned to its own love, because that constitutes his life’s delight, that is, his life.

[3] This may be illustrated somewhat by the fact that all the least parts of the body turn themselves to the common center of our earth, which is called the center of gravity; and from this it is that wheresoever men are, even those who are in directly opposite positions, and are called antipodes, all stand upon their feet. Yet this center of gravity is merely nature’s center of gravity; but there is another center of gravity in the spiritual world, and this, with man, is determined by the love in which he is, downwards if his love is infernal, but upwards if his love is heavenly; and whichever way man’s love is determined, in the same way his thoughts and intentions are determined; for these are in the spiritual world, and are impelled by the forces that are there. [4] From this it can now be seen that the perversion of the church with men, which is signified by “the woman Jezebel,” is solely from the loves of self and of the world, since these turn man’s interiors, which are of his mind, downward, thus turning them away from heaven. It is said “the perversion of the church with men,” because the church is in man, as heaven is in the angel; every church is constituted of those that are of the church, and not of any others, even though they may be born where the church is; as can be clearly seen from this, that love and faith constitute the church, and love and faith must be in man, consequently the church must be in him.

It is said of Jezebel that she “calleth herself a prophetess,” not that Jezebel the wife of Ahab called herself a prophetess, but this is said because “Jezebel” signifies the delight of the love of self and the world; and this delight teaches and seduces those who are in truths. For everyone, when he thinks by himself, thinks from his own love, and thus imbues himself with falsities, which is “to teach and to seduce.” Of Jezebel we read in the Word: That Ahab the king of Israel took to wife Jezebel the daughter of the king of the Zidonians, and that he went away and served Baal, and reared up to him an altar in Samaria, and made a grove (1 Kings 16:31–33); And that Jezebel slew the prophets of Jehovah (1 Kings 18:4, 13); And that she wished to slay Elijah also (1 Kings 19:1–2 seq.); And that through craft, by substituting false witnesses, she took away the vineyard from Naboth, and slew him (1 Kings 21:6–7 seq.); It was therefore predicted by Elijah that dogs should eat her (1 Kings 21:23; 2 Kings 9:10); And afterwards, by the command of Jehu, she was thrown out of the window, and some of her blood was sprinkled upon the wall and upon the horses that trod her under foot (2 Kings 9:32–34). [2] By all these things the perversion of the church by the delight of the love of self and the world, and by the evils and falsities flowing forth therefrom, was represented. For all the historical parts of the Word, as well as the prophetical, are representative of such things as are of the church. “Baal” whom Ahab served, and to whom he raised up an altar, signifies the worship from the evils of the love of self and the world; the “grove” which he made signifies"

That “Jezebel slew the prophets of Jehovah” signifies the destruction of the church in respect to its truths; that “she wished to slay Elijah also” signifies a desire to annihilate the Word, for Elijah represented the Word. “The vineyard which by means of false witnesses she took away from Naboth” signifies the falsification of truth and the adulteration of good; the prophecy of Elijah that “dogs should eat her” signifies uncleanness and profanation. That “she was thrown out of a window, and some of her blood was sprinkled upon the wall and upon the horses that trod her under foot,” signifies the lot of those who are of that character; what the lot of such will be can be seen from the internal sense of the particulars there. From this it can be seen that by “the woman Jezebel, who calleth herself a prophetess,” no other Jezebel is meant than Jezebel the wife of Ahab, spoken of in the Word; and that by her those are described who are in the doctrine of all falsities from the delights of the loves of self and of the world. 161. To commit whoredom, and to eat idol sacrifices, signifies falsifications of truth and adulterations of good. This is evident from the signification of “committing whoredom,” as being to falsify truths (of which see above, n. 141), and from the signification of “eating idol sacrifices,” as being to appropriate evil (of which see also above, n. 141a); to adulterate good is also signified, because appropriations of evil are, in things of the church, adulterations of good; for it is an application of its goods to evils, thus adulterating them. For example, the goods of the Israelitish church were signified by the altar, the sacrifices, and eating together of the things sacrificed; when these things were given over to Baal, goods were applied to evils (besides other like instances). It is the like in a church in which there are no representatives, when the Word is applied to confirm the evils of self, as is done by the papal body to gain dominion over the universal heaven. That “to commit whoredom and to eat idol sacrifices” signifies to falsify truths and adulterate goods, is also clear from this, that the deeds of Jezebel are in one expression called “whoredoms” and “witchcrafts,” in the second book of Kings:"

And I gave her time that she might repent of her whoredom, and she repented not, signifies that those who are in falsities therefrom do not turn themselves to truths nor by means of truths. This is evident from the signification of “repenting of whoredom,” as being to turn oneself from falsities to truths; for “whoredom” is the falsification of truth, and “to repent” is to turn oneself away from falsities; for repentance is an actual turning from falsities to truths, and dissociation and separation from falsities (see above, n. 143); also from the signification of “she repented not,” as being that they do not turn themselves from falsities to truths. These things are said of Jezebel, but those are meant who from the delight of the loves of self and the world have falsified truths and adulterated goods; for in the prophecies of the Word one person is named, and by that person are meant all of that character. [2] Something shall be here said briefly about this statement that those who have falsified truths with themselves by applying them to the delights of self-love do not afterwards turn themselves to truths. Man sees from the Word the truths of the church from the spiritual or internal man and from its intellectual, but he does not receive them therein except to the extent that he loves them so as to wish to do them. When man so wills, his internal or spiritual man calls forth and elevates to itself, out of the natural man and its memory, the truths that are there, and conjoins them to the love that is of his will; thus the internal spiritual man, where man’s interior and higher mind resides, is opened and is successively filled and perfected. But if man permits the natural delight, which is the delight of the love of self and the world, to have dominion, then he views all things from that delight; and if he then sees truths he applies them to his own love and falsifies them. When this is done the internal spiritual man is closed; for as this is suited only to the reception of such things as are in heaven, it cannot bear that truths should be falsified; consequently when truths are falsified it contracts itself and closes almost, as a fibril does when touched by a prickle. When the internal is once closed, the love of self reigns, or"

For this reason those who have falsified truths by applying them to the delights of the love of self and the world are unable afterwards to turn themselves to truths. This is what is here meant by these words, “I gave to the woman Jezebel time that she might repent of her whoredom, and she repented not.” 163. Verse 22. Behold, I cast her into a bed, signifies that they are left to their natural man, and to the doctrine of falsities therein. This is evident from the signification of a “bed,” as being the natural man, also the doctrine of falsities (of which presently). What now follows treats of those who suffer themselves to be seduced by those who are in the doctrine of falsities from the delight of the love of self and the world, who are meant by “Jezebel” (as was said above). Those who suffer themselves to be seduced are not like those who have falsified truths and adulterated goods from the delight of those loves; for such have seen truths and have applied them to favor their delights, and have thus perverted them, and afterwards these are unable to turn themselves to truths and acknowledge them. These are treated of in the preceding article (n. 162). But those who have not done this, but have suffered themselves to be led away by those who have, have not so closed the internal or spiritual man with themselves; for they have not themselves falsified truths, but have put faith in those who have, because these falsities sound like truths. For these think no more deeply than that their leaders must be believed because they are intelligent and wise; thus they hang upon the lips of a master. There are many such at this day in Christendom, especially among those born in countries where the papal religion prevails. These are meant by those that commit adultery with Jezebel in a bed. [2] “Bed” signifies the doctrine of falsities, and at the same time the natural man, because the doctrine of falsities has no other source than the natural man separated from the spiritual; and the natural man separated from the spiritual sees worldly things in light, but heavenly things in thick darkness; it sees falsity, therefore, in the place of truth, and evil in the place of good; moreover, if it"

And when the natural world with man is not governed by the spiritual world, the bond with heaven is broken; and when this is broken man makes the world his all, and heaven of little or no account; so also self as all, and God of little or no account. When the external or natural man is in such a state it is in falsities from the evils that spring forth out of the love of self and the world. As “bed,” therefore, signifies the natural man, it also signifies the doctrine of falsities. [3] “Bed” signifies the natural man, because the natural man underlies the spiritual, thus the spiritual lies on it and on the things that are in it as on its own bed. That “bed” signifies the natural man, also the doctrinals that are in it, can be seen from the passages in the word where “bed” is mentioned, as in the following. In Amos: As the shepherd hath rescued out of the mouth of the lion two legs and a bit of an ear, so shall the sons of Israel be rescued that dwell in Samaria on the corner of a bed, and on the end of a couch (Amos 3:12). “Lion” signifies the church, here those therein that destroy goods and truths; “legs and a bit of an ear” are the goods that are in the natural man, and something of perception of truth therefrom; “the sons of Israel that dwell in Samaria” are those of the church; “on the corner of the bed, and on the end of a couch,” are those in a little natural light from the spiritual, and in some truths therefrom. [4] In the same: Woe to them that are at ease in Zion, and trust in the mountains of Samaria; to them that lie upon the beds of ivory, and stretch themselves upon their couches, and eat the lambs out of the flock, and the calves out of the midst of the stall; that devise for themselves instruments of song; that drink out of bowls of wine, and anoint themselves with the firstlings of the oils: but they are not grieved over the breach of Joseph (Amos 6:4–6)."

(That “Joseph” in the highest sense signifies the Lord in respect to the Divine spiritual; in the internal sense the Lord’s spiritual kingdom, thus also the spiritual church; and in the external sense the fructification of good and multiplication of truth, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 3969, 3971, 4669, 6417, 6526.) [5] In Moses: May the blessings of thy father prevail above the blessings of my parents, may they be on the head of Joseph, and on the head of the bed14 of his brethren (Gen. 49:26). “Joseph,” as was said, is the Lord’s spiritual church; “the head of the bed of his brethren” is the spiritual that flows into all the truths and goods of that church (for the twelve sons or tribes of Israel signify all the truths and goods of the church in the complex, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 3858, 3926, 4060, 6335).

(That “those who grind” are those who collect and learn such things as are serviceable to faith, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 4335, 7780, 9995; that “field” means reception of truth and good, see n. 368, 3310, 9141, 9295.) [7] In John: Jesus said to the sick man at the pool of Bethsaida,15 Arise, take up thy bed, and walk. And straightway the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked. Afterward Jesus findeth him, and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole; sin no more, lest a worse thing befall thee (John 5:8–12, 14). And in Mark: They uncovered the roof where Jesus was, and they let down16 the bed whereon the sick of the palsy lay. Jesus said, Whether is easier to say, thy sins are forgiven thee, or to say, Arise, and take up thy bed and walk? Then he said, Arise, take up thy bed and walk, and go unto thine house. And immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went forth before them all (Mark 2:4, 9, 11–12). The Lord saying to these sick, “Arise, take up thy bed, and walk,” signifies doctrine, and a life according thereto; “bed” signifies doctrine, and “to walk” life (that “ walking” is living, see above, n. 97). “The sick man” signifies those that have transgressed and sinned; consequently the Lord said to the sick man at the pool of Bethsaida, “Behold, thou art made whole; sin no more, lest a worse thing befall thee”; and to the paralytic let down on a bed through the roof, “Whether it is easier to say, thy sins are forgiven thee, or to say, Arise, take up thy bed, and walk?” Those who know nothing of the internal sense of the Word may believe that the words that the Lord spoke involve nothing more than what is obvious in the sense of the letter, when yet every particular of what the Lord spoke has a spiritual meaning, for he spoke from the Divine, and thus in the presence both of heaven and of the world (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 2533, 4637, 4807, 9048, 9063, 9086, 10126, 10276)."

Nine cubits was the length thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man (Deut. 3:11). The bed of Og is here described, because he was of the remnants of the Rephaim, and because he was king of Bashan; for by the “Rephaim,” those were signified who were in the love of self above others, and therefore natural above all others, and from a persuasion of their eminence over others were in falsities of every kind (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 581, 1268, 1270, 1271, 1673, 7686). And by “Bashan” the external of the church, thus the natural, was signified, for Bashan was outside the land of Canaan where the church was. On this account the bed of Og is described, which would not have been described unless such things had been signified by “Og”; for whatsoever is mentioned in the Word, even in the historical Word, is significative as to every expression. From this it is that the Word is spiritual in each and every particular, and therefore Divine from inmosts to ultimates. On this account, also, it is said that the bed was “of iron,” that it was “in Rabbah of the sons of Ammon,” and that “nine cubits was the length thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man.” For “iron” signifies what is natural (see below, n. 176); “Rabbah of Ammon” signifies the falsifications of truth (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 2468); and “nine cubits the length thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it,” signifies the conjunction of evil and falsity. [9] From this it can be seen what the Word is in its bosom. Because “bed” signifies doctrine, it was among the statutes in the church with the sons of Israel: That every bed whereon he that hath the issue lieth should be unclean; and that the man who touched his bed should wash his clothes, and bathe himself in waters (Lev. 15:4–5)."

It is said “he gathered up his feet upon the bed,” because “feet” also signify the natural (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 2162, 3147, 3761, 3986, 4280, 4938–4952). 164.

This is evident from the signification of “repenting,” as being to separate oneself from falsities (of which see above, n. 143); also from the signification of “works,” which are here whoredoms with Jezebel, by which are signified the reception of falsities (of which see just above, n. 163). To separate oneself from these is to repent, and to repent is to refrain from evils and falsities, and afterwards to shun them and to have them in aversion (see Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, n. 161, 165, 169 seq.) 166. Verse 23. And her sons I will kill with death, signifies that thus falsities are extinguished. This is evident from the signification of “sons,” as being truths of the church from the Word, and, in the contrary sense, falsities (of which presently); also from the signification of “killing with death,” as being to extinguish; for falsities are separated, and as it were extinguished by temptations, and by man’s refraining from them, and shunning them, and holding them in aversion. “Sons” in the Word signify truths, and in the contrary sense falsities, because the spiritual sense of the Word treats only of such things as relate to the church and heaven; and all things of the church and of heaven have reference to the goods which are of love, and to the truths which are of faith. From this it is that the names of kinships and relationships, as husband, wife, son, daughter, brother, sister, daughter-in-law, son-in-law, and others, signify spiritual things that have reference to spiritual birth, which is regeneration, and to the heavenly marriage, which is the marriage of good and truth. The things that are born of this marriage are likewise goods and truths. From this it is that “daughters” in the Word signify goods, and “sons” truths, both derived from the good that is signified by “father,” and from the truth that is signified by “mother.” (That all the truths and goods that are with the regenerate man are conjoined according to spiritual relationships, and follow in order, see Arcana Coelestia, n."

And as all things in man’s body correspond to the things that are in his mind, there are two things also that rule there, namely the will and the understanding. These two kingdoms of the mind correspond to the two kingdoms of the body, namely the will to the heart and its pulse, and the understanding to the lungs and their respiration. Without this correspondence the body could not live, not even a particle of it. As the heart corresponds to the will, so it corresponds to the good of love; and as the lungs correspond to the understanding, so they also correspond to the truths of faith. It is from this correspondence that “heart” signifies love, and “soul” signifies faith. It is from this that the expression “from the heart and soul” is so often used in the Word, by which is meant from love and faith. (As this correspondence is much treated of in Arcana Coelestia, these things may be seen more fully explained there, namely, that “heart” in the Word signifies love; and because it signifies love, it also signifies the will, n. 2930, 3313, 7542, 8910,"

The like is signified by the organ that purifies; and all purification from falsities is effected by truths.

Here there is another word in the original for “reins,” that includes the separation both of falsities from truths and of evils from goods. This shows that the “reins” signify purification and separation. [5] In the same: I will bless Jehovah, who hath given me counsel; also my reins chastise me in the night (Ps. 16:7). “Night” signifies the state of man when falsities rise up; the consequent combat of truths with falsities is signified by “my reins chastise me.” In the same: Even the darkness doth not make darkness before thee, but the night is lucid as the day; as the darkness so is the light. For thou possessest my reins, my bone was not hidden from thee when I was made in secret (Ps. 139:12, 13, 15). “Darkness” means falsities, and “light” truths; to “possess the reins” is to know falsities and truths with man; therefore it is said, “my bone was not hidden from thee when I was made in secret,” which signifies that no falsity that was made was hidden. (That “darkness” means falsity and “light” truth, see Heaven and Hell, n. 126–140; and that “bone” means truth in the ultimate of order and in the"

[6] As “the reins” signified truths purified from falsities, so: In the sacrifices, the fats and reins alone were offered up (as may be seen in Exod. 29:13; Lev. 3:4, 10, 15; 4:9; and elsewhere). Fats and reins alone were offered upon the altar because “fats” signified the goods of love, and “reins” the truths of faith. (That “fats” or “fatnesses” signify the goods of love, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 353, 5943, 6409, 10033. That the “reins” signify the truths of faith, examining, purifying, and rejecting from themselves falsities, is from correspondence; for each and every thing of the body corresponds, as can be seen in Heaven and Hell, where this is shown in its chapter entitled, There is a correspondence of all things of heaven with all things of man, n. 87–102; and on the reins, n. 96–97.) Unless it be known that there is such a correspondence, who could ever know why it is so often said of Jehovah or the Lord in the Word, that “he searcheth and proveth the reins and the heart?” (On the correspondence of the reins, of the ureters, and of the bladder, see further in Arcana Coelestia, n. 5380–5386.) To “search the reins and the heart” signifies also to explore the exteriors and the interiors of man, because truth is without and good is within; and spiritual good, which in its essence is truth, and in particular is signified by the “reins,” is exterior good; while celestial good which in particular is signified by the “heart,” is interior good. (This can be seen more fully from what is shown respecting the spiritual kingdom and the celestial kingdom, in Heaven and Hell, n. 20–26.) 168. And I will give to each one of you according to your works, signifies eternal blessedness according to one’s internal in the external.

Here “giving to each one according to his works” signifies eternal blessedness according to the internal in the external, because those are here treated of, who at the same time are in the internal and the external, and of the conjunction of the two (see above, n. 150). It is said, eternal blessedness according to the internal in the external, because all heavenly blessedness with man, spirit, and angel flows in through the internal into their external; for their internal is formed for the reception of all things of heaven, and their external for the reception of all things of the world; therefore there is heavenly blessedness with those only with whom the internal has been opened and formed after the image of heaven; and not with those in whom the internal has been shut; the blessedness of these is the delight of honor, glory, and gain, which delight a man may have so long as he lives in the world. (But after death, when man becomes a spirit, this is changed into the corresponding delight which is filthy and direful, see Heaven and Hell, n. 485–490; and that the blessedness of heaven, which is called heavenly joy, those only have who are in the internal and from that in the external, see the same, n. 395–414; and what the internal and the external are, see Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, n. 36–53.) 169.

From this it is clear that by the “doctrine of Jezebel” is meant the life of the love of self and the world. 171. And who have not known the depths of satan, as they say, signifies entanglement with these, as is evident from this, that the loves that rule in the hells are the loves of self and of the world, and those loves are altogether contrary to the love to the Lord and the love to the neighbor, which rule in heaven. “Satan,” by whom is meant hell (see above, n. 120), unceasingly inspires the loves of self and of the world; and these man also receives with delight, because they are in him hereditarily, and are therefore his proprium; thus hell insinuates itself with man and entangles him. This is what is signified by “the depths of satan.” There are few, however, who are aware of this, because these loves, as they are man’s proprium by inheritance, draw his mind to themselves by allurements from delight, and thus draw him away from the delights of heavenly loves, even until he does not know what the delights of heaven are. These delights of the love of self and the love of the world are what close up the internal man and open the external; and to the extent that the external is opened the internal is closed, so that the man is finally in total thick darkness in respect to the things of heaven and the church, though in light [lumen] in respect to the things of self and the world. (These things may be seen more fully described in Heaven and Hell, in the chapter where it is shown that the divine of the lord in heaven is love to him, and charity towards the neighbor, n. 13–19; and in the chapter where it is shown that all who are in the hells are in evils and in falsities therefrom, out of the loves of self and of the world, and that these loves are the infernal fires, n. 551–565, 566–575; also Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, n. 65–83, where these two loves are treated of. 172.

When that is closed there is no conjunction of the internal with the external, which looks to the world, nor any influx from heaven. It is said “burden,” because man’s proprium, which is to love self above God and the world above heaven, offers resistance. 173. Verse 25. Nevertheless that which ye have, hold fast till I come, signifies steadfastness in a state of the good of love and faith, even until visitation. This is evident from the signification of “that which ye have hold fast,” as being to be steadfast in a state of love and faith, thus in a state of conjunction of the internal with the external, in which they are capable of being so far as they resist the delights of the loves of self and of the world. For so far as man removes these delights from him is the internal conjoined with the external, thus more in one man and less in another. This is evident also from the signification of “till I come,” as meaning visitation (of which see above, n. 144). 174. Verse 26. And he that overcometh and keepeth my works unto the end, signifies perseverance in love and faith after combat against these loves and their removal as far as possible. This is evident from the signification of “overcoming” as being to fight against the delights of the loves of self and of the world, and to remove them. That this is the spiritual sense of these words follows from the connection. It is evident also from the signification of “keeping unto the end,” as being perseverance even unto death; for he who perseveres even unto death in love and faith is saved; for such as he then is in respect to his life, he thenceforth remains to eternity (see above, n. 125). It is evident also from the signification of “works” as being the things of love and faith in cause and in effect, that is in internals and in externals. These things are here signified by “works,” because these are the things treated of in what is written to the angel of this church (see above, n. 150). It is said, “keepeth my works,” because everything of love and faith, and every opening of the internal and its conjunction with the external is from the Lord alone; therefore the “works,” by which these are signified, are not man’s, but the Lord’s with man; and consequently it is said, “my works.”"

This is evident from the signification of “nations,” as being evils (of which presently); and from the signification of “giving power over them,” as being that these (the evils) will then be dispersed by the Lord. “To have power,” in reference to “over the nations,” means to scatter in reference to evils; thus there is an adaptation of words to their subjects. It is said that evils will be scattered by the Lord, for the Lord scatters evils by means of truths. He first discovers them to man by means of truths, and when man acknowledges the evils, the Lord scatters them. (That the Lord alone does this, see Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, n. 200.) “Nations and peoples” are often mentioned in the Word, and those who know nothing of the spiritual or internal sense of the Word, believe that peoples and nations are to be understood. But “peoples” mean those who are in truths, or in the contrary sense those who are in falsities, and “nations” those who are in goods, or in the contrary sense, those who are in evils. And as such are meant by “peoples” and by “nations,” so abstractly from persons “peoples” mean truths or falsities, and “nations” goods and evils; for the true spiritual sense is abstracted from persons, spaces, times, and like things, that are proper to nature. [2] With these the natural sense of the Word, which is the sense of its letter, is at one; and the sense that is at one with these serves as a basis to the sense that is apart from them. For all things that are in nature are ultimates of Divine order, and the Divine does not rest in the middle, but flows down even to its ultimates, and there subsists. From this it is that the Word in the letter is such as it is, and unless it were such it would not serve as a basis for the wisdom of angels who are spiritual. It can be seen from this how mistaken those are who despise the Word on account of its style. “Nations” signify those who are in good, and in the abstract, goods, because men who lived in ancient times were divided into nations, families, and houses; and they then loved each other mutually; and the father of a nation loved the whole nation which was from him; thus the good of love reigned among them. For this reason “nations” signified goods. But when men came into the opposite state, which took place in the following ages when empires were established,"

[3] That “nations” in the Word signify either goods or evils, and “people” either truths or falsities, can be seen from the following passages. In Isaiah: Nations shall walk to thy light, and kings to the brightness of thy rising. Then shalt thou see and flow together, and thine heart shall be enlarged, because the multitude of the sea is converted unto thee, the army of the nations come unto thee; thy gates shall be opened continually, they shall not be shut by day and by night, that men may bring unto thee the army of the nations, and their kings shall be brought; for the nation or kingdom that will not serve thee shall perish; and the nations by wasting shall be wasted. Thou shalt suck the milk of nations, even the breasts of kings shalt thou suck. The little one shall become a thousand, and the few a numerous nation (Isa. 60:3, 5, 11–12, 16, 22). here the Lord is treated of; and by “nations” all who are in the good of love to him are meant, and by “kings” all who are in the truths of faith in him. From this it is manifest who are meant by the “nations” that “shall walk to thy light”; and by “the army of the nations that shall be brought”; also, who are meant by “the kings” that “shall walk to the brightness of thy rising”; and by “the kings of the nations” that “shall be brought”; also, what is meant by “Thou shalt suck the milk of nations and the breasts of kings” (“milk” is the delight of the good of love, likewise “breasts,” for milk is from them). The multiplication of truth and the fructification of good are described by the “little one shall become a thousand, and the few a numerous nation.” But by “the nations that shall be wasted” are meant all that are in evils, and also the evils themselves. [4] In the same: Behold I will lift up my hand toward the nations, and set up mine ensign toward the peoples, that they may bring thy sons in the bosom, and carry thy daughters upon the shoulder; and kings shall be thy nourishers and the chief women thy sucklers; with the face to the earth shall they bow down to thee (Isa. 49:22, 23)."

And of these it is said that their “kings shall be thy nourishers, and the chief women thy sucklers.” “Kings” are truths themselves, “chief women” are the goods thereof; and as man is regenerated by both of these, and also nourished, it is said that they shall be “nourishers” and “sucklers.” (That man is regenerated by means of truths and a life according to them, see Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, n. 23, 24, 27, 186.) This is the internal sense of these words; without that sense who could understand them?

By “nations and tongues” all who are in the goods of love and in truths therefrom are meant. It is said that “they shall bring out of all nations a gift to Jehovah, upon horses and upon the chariot”; “a gift to Jehovah” is worship from the good of love; “horses and chariots” are intellectuals and doctrinals, for these are the source and foundation of worship. (That this is what “horses and chariots” signify, see White Horse, n. 1–5.)

It is said, “a people from the land of the north, and a nation from the sides of the earth,” for the “north” signifies falsity from evil, and “the sides of the earth” signify what is outside of the church, thus evils remote from the goods of the church. “To roar like the sea, and to ride upon horses,” is to persuade by fallacies of the senses, and by reasonings therefrom.

From this it is manifest that “nations” signify goods, and in the contrary sense evils; by “the nations that dwelt in his shade,” goods; and by “the nations that cut him off, and cast him down,” evils. (See, moreover, what is said and shown about nations and their signification in Arcana Coelestia, namely, that by “nations” in the Word are meant those who are in good, and consequently goods themselves, n. 1059, 1159, 1258, 1260, 1416, 1849, 6005; “the assembly of the nations,” truths and goods, n. 4574, 7830; “the holy nation,” the spiritual kingdom, n. 9255, 9256; when it is said “nation and people,” by “nation” those who are in celestial good are meant, and by “people” those who are in spiritual good, n. 10288. That by “nations,” especially the nations of the land of Canaan, evils and falsities of every kind are meant, n. 1059, 1205, 1868, 6306, 8054, 8317, 9320, 9327). 176. Verse 27.

This is evident from the signification of “ruling,” as being to chastise, for it is added that “he would shiver them as pottery vessels,” and the evils which are signified are chastised by means of truths. It is evident also from the signification of “an iron rod,” as being truths that are in the natural man; a “rod” or “staff” signifies the power by which chastisement is effected; and “iron” truths in the natural man which chastise. (That a “rod” or “staff” is power, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 4013, 4015, 4876, 4936, 6947, 7011, 7026, 7568, 7572; that it is for this reason that kings have a scepter, which is a short staff, n. 4581, 4876.) “Iron” signifies truths in the natural man, because metals, as well as the other things of the earth, by correspondence signify things spiritual and celestial, all of which have reference to truths and goods. “Gold” signifies the good of the internal man; “silver” its truth; “copper” or “brass” the good of the external or natural man; “iron” its truth. For this reason the ages were called by the ancients after the names of the metals, namely, golden, silver, copper, and iron; the Golden Age from the most ancient men, who lived in the good of love; the Silver Age from the ancients after them who lived in truths from that good; the Copper Age from their posterity who were in external or natural good; the Iron Age from the posterity of these who were in natural truth alone without good. Natural truth is truth in the memory, not in the life; truth of life is good. (But more about this correspondence in Heaven and Hell, n. 104, 115.) [2] The successive states of the church, even until the coming of the Lord, are meant by the “gold,” the “silver,” the “brass,” and the “iron,” of which the statue seen by Nebuchadnezzar in a dream was composed, which is thus described in Daniel: His head was good gold, his breast and his arms silver, his belly and his thighs brass, his legs iron, his feet part iron and part clay. A stone was cut out of the rock, and it smote the image upon his feet that were iron and clay, and brake them to pieces. Whereas thou sawest the feet partly of potter’s clay and partly of iron, it signifies that the kingdom shall be divided; the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken. Whereas thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves by the seed of man; but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron doth not mingle with clay (Dan. 2:32–34, 41–43)."

(That this is signified by “seed,” see Arcana Coelestia, n. 3038, 3373, 10248, 10249; that “man” signifies the Lord, from whom is the Word, and also signifies the church, see n. 768, 4287, 7424, 7523, 8547, 9276.) That “potter’s clay” signifies the falsities that are in the natural man, will be seen in the following article (n. 177). By “the stone cut of the rock,” which “smote the image upon his feet,” the Lord by means of Divine truth is meant, and the destruction of falsities not cohering with truths from the Word. (That a “stone” is truth, and that “the stone of Israel” is the Lord in respect to Divine truth, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 643, 1298, 3720, 6426, 8609, 10376; that “rock” likewise signifies the Lord, n. 8581, 10580, and Last Judgment, n. 57.) Because “iron” signifies truths in the natural man, “the feet of the statue” were seen to be “of iron,” for “feet” signify the natural (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 2162, 3147, 3761, 3986, 4280, 4938–4952).

Here the state of the celestial church is treated of. (That “iron” signifies truth in the natural man, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 425, 426.) [4] These passages are cited that it may be known what is meant by the “iron rod,” namely, the power whereby the Lord chastises the evils and disperses the falsities that are in the natural man; for a “rod” or “staff” signifies power (as was said above), and “iron” signifies truths in the natural man. The Lord chastises evils and disperses falsities by means of truths in the natural man, because all evils and the falsities therefrom have their seat in the natural man, and none in the spiritual or internal man. The internal man does not receive evils and falsities, but is closed against them. And as all evils and falsities have their seat in the natural man, they must needs be chastised and dispersed by means of such things as are there, which are truths in the natural man. Truths in the natural man are knowledges and cognitions, from which man can think, reason, and conclude naturally respecting the truths and goods of the church, and the falsities and evils which are opposed to these, and can consequently be in some natural illustration when he reads the Word. For the Word in the letter is not understood without illustration; and illustration is either spiritual or natural. Spiritual illustration is only with those who are spiritual; and the spiritual are those that are of the good of love and charity and in truths therefrom; while mere natural illustration is with those who are natural (see Heaven and Hell, n. 153, 425, 455; and above, n. 140). Moreover, those who are spiritual have, whilst they live in the world, illustration in the natural; but this springs from illustration in the spiritual; for with them the Lord flows in through the spiritual or internal man into the natural or external, and thus illustrates it, from which enlightenment man can see what is true and good, and what is false and evil, and when he sees that, the Lord scatters the evils and the falsities that are in the natural man,"

[5] From this it can now be seen what is signified by “the iron rod,” with which the Lord is to rule the nations, that is, chastise the evils that are in the natural man. These things are said to the angel of this church, because in what is written to this angel the internal and external man and their conjunction are treated of; for when the internal and the external or the spiritual and the natural are conjoined, the Lord chastises the evils and falsities that are in the natural man, and this by means of the knowledges of truth and good. But with those with whom the internal and external man are not conjoined, evils and falsities cannot be chastised and scattered, since they receive nothing from heaven through the spiritual man, but all things they receive are from the world; and these their rational favors, and supplies confirmations. Things similar to those here signified by “the iron rod” are also signified in the following passages. In David: Thou shalt bruise [the nations] with an iron scepter; as a potter’s vessel thou shalt dash them in pieces (Ps. 2:9). In Isaiah: He shall smite the land with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked (Isa. 11:4). In Revelation: The woman brought forth a male, a son, who is to rule all nations with an iron rod (Rev. 12:5).

The “daughter of Zion” is the celestial church; “horn” is power in the natural man; “hoofs” are the ultimates there, called sensual knowledges; hence it is evident what is signified by “making the horn iron, and the hoofs brass.” (That the “daughter of Zion” is the celestial church, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 2362, 9055; that “horn” is the power of truth from good in the natural man, n. 2832, 9081, 9719, 9720, 9721, 10182, 10186; and that “hoofs” are the knowledges of the sensual man, which are truths in the ultimate of order, n. 7729.) 177. As earthen vessels shall they be shivered, signifies the total dispersion of falsities. This is evident from the signification of “earthen vessels,” as being such things in the natural man as are from self-intelligence; and all things in the natural man that have respect to the things of heaven and the church and which are from self-intelligence are falsities (of which presently). It is evident also from the signification of being “shivered,” as being to be dispersed; “to disperse” is said of falsities, as “to shiver” is said of earthen vessels. That “earthen vessels” signify the things in the natural man that are from self-intelligence in matters of heaven and the church, and that these things are falsities, will be shown in what follows; something must first be said to show that the things that have respect to heaven and the church that gain entrance by self- intelligence are falsities. Those who think from self-intelligence think from the world; for man, from his proprium loves only the things of the world and of self, and what he loves he also sees and perceives; the things he loves he calls goods, and the things he sees and perceives therefrom he calls truths; but these goods, which from love he so calls, are evils, and the truths which he sees from that love are falsities, since they spring forth from the loves of self and of the world, which loves are contrary to the loves of heaven, which are love to the Lord and love to the neighbor; and the things that pour forth from contraries are contraries."

The reason is, that to read the Word solely for the repute of erudition or for fame, that they may be exalted to honors and gain wealth, is to read it for the sake of self and the world as ends, thus from the loves of self and the world. And as these loves are of man’s proprium so the things that man sees and perceives from them are from self-intelligence. [3] But those who read the Word from the spiritual affection of truth, which affection is a love of knowing truth because it is truth, see truths in the Word, and rejoice in heart when they see them; and this because they are in illumination from the Lord. Illumination descends from the Lord through heaven from the light there, which light is Divine truth. It is therefore given to them to see truths from the light of truth, and this in the Word, because the Word is Divine truth, and in it are stored up all the truths of heaven. But those only are in this illumination who are in the two loves of heaven, which are love to the Lord and love towards the neighbor; for these loves open the inner or higher mind, which is formed to receive the light of heaven, and through that mind in them the light of heaven flows in and illuminates. But so long as they live in the world they do not perceive truths in that mind, but they see them in the lower mind, the mind of the external or natural man. Such as these do not think from self-intelligence when they read the Word. The especial reason why these do not think from their self-intelligence when they read the Word is, that their interior or spiritual mind looks to the Lord, and the Lord then elevates it up to himself, and with it the lower or natural mind, thus withdrawing it from man’s proprium, which cannot be done with those who have regard first and foremost to themselves and the world.

When the internal or spiritual man, in which is the inner or higher mind of which we have just spoken, is opened, then the Lord subdues the evils and disperses the falsities which are in the external or natural man. These things, then, are what are meant in the spiritual sense by this, that the son of man is to “give them power over the nations, and he shall rule them with an iron rod, and as earthen vessels they shall be shivered.” [5] That “earthen vessels” signify such things as are from self- intelligence, thus the falsities that are in the natural man, is evident from various passages in the Word, of which I will cite the following as confirmation. In David: Thou shalt bruise the nations with an iron scepter; as a potter’s vessel thou shall dash them in pieces (Ps. 2:9). In this passage also “to bruise the nations with an iron scepter” is to chastise and subdue the evils that are in the natural man. “Scepter” here has the same signification as “staff” or “rod.” It is added “as a potter’s vessel,” because that signifies falsity from self-intelligence. In the sense of the letter this is a comparison, for it is said “as a potter’s vessel,” and “as earthen vessels”; but in the internal sense comparisons are not perceived as comparisons, since comparisons are equally from things significative (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 3579, 8989.) “A potter’s vessel,” or “earthen vessel,” signifies what is false, because a potter is one who forms, and a vessel is what is formed; and when man forms the vessel it is a falsity, but when the Lord forms it with man it is a truth; consequently in the Word “a potter’s vessel” signifies either what is false or what is true, and “a potter” signifies one who forms. [6] The Lord himself is called in the Word a “potter,” from his forming man by means of truths; as in Isaiah: Jehovah our Father; we are the clay, and thou art our potter, and we all are the work of thy hands (Isa. 64:8)."

[7] As the Jews and Israelites falsified all the truths of the Word by applying them to themselves and to their own exaltation above all nations and peoples in the universal world, so their falsities are called “marred vessels” of a potter, as in Isaiah: Who have said to the seers, See not; and to those that have vision, See not for us right things, speak unto us smooth things, see illusions; depart from the way; therefore iniquity shall break them as the breaking of the potter’s bottle; in beating it shall not spare, so that there shall not be found in the fragment thereof a sherd to take fire from the hearth or to draw waters from the cistern (Isa. 30:10–11, 13–14). That they wholly deprived themselves of truths, and immersed themselves in falsities, is described by this, “They said to the seers, See not; and to those that have vision, See not for us right things, speak unto us smooth things, see illusions; depart from the way.” That they had so immersed themselves in falsities that no more truth remained, is described by “the breaking of the potter’s bottle, so that there should not be found in the fragment a sherd to take fire from the hearth or to draw waters out of the cistern.” By this is signified that not enough of truth should be left to enable them to perceive any good and truth from the Word; for “fire” signifies good, and “water” truth; “hearth” the Word in respect to good; “cistern” and “fountain” the Word in respect to truth. [8] In Jeremiah: The word came to Jeremiah, Arise, and go down to the potter’s house. Then I went down to the potter’s house, and behold he wrought a work on the table.

That the truth of the church should be taken away from them and given to others, is meant by this, that “the potter turned back and made it another vessel, as was right in his eyes.” [9] In the same: Jehovah said, Go buy a potter’s earthen bottle of the elders of the people and of the elders of the priests; and go forth into the valley of the son of Hinnom. Then shalt thou break the bottle before the eyes of the men that go with thee; and shalt say, I will break this people, and this city as one breaketh a potter’s vessel, that cannot be made whole again; and they shall bury in Tophet, because there is no more a place to bury in (Jer. 19:1–2, 10–11). “The potter’s earthen bottle, or vessel, from the elders of the people and of the priests” is here also the falsity in which all of that nation were. That this falsity was such that it could not be dispersed by means of truths is described by this, that “he should break the vessel before the eyes of the men that went with him, that it could not be made whole again”; that they should “bury in Tophet, because there was no more a place,” signifies where all truths and goods have been destroyed. [10] In Nahum: Draw thee waters for the siege; strengthen thy fortresses; go into the mire and tread the clay, repair the brick kiln. There shall the fire devour thee; the sword shall cut thee off (Nahum 3:14–15). “To draw waters for the siege and to strengthen the fortresses” is to fortify falsities by various means against truths; “to go into the mire and tread the clay” is to confirm falsities by fictions and fallacies; doctrine thence derived is called “a brick kiln,” because infernal love is strengthened by falsifications; it is therefore said that “the fire shall devour, and the sword cut off”; “fire” is infernal love, and a “sword” is falsity combating and destroying truth. “A potter’s vessel” or “earthen vessel” signifies falsity, because it corresponds to"

By “the Father” here the Divine in himself, or that which he had from conception, is meant, for this Divine was one with the Father, as he declares. It is said comparatively, for as the Lord glorified his human, so he regenerates man; that is, as he united his Divine to the human and the human to the Divine, so he conjoins the internal to the external and the external to the internal with man. (But as this arcanum cannot be explained in a few words so as to be understood, consult what has been shown respecting it in Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, n. 280–297, and in the passages cited from Arcana Coelestia in that work, n. 185, 298–307, in which it is fully explained.) 179.

It is evident also from the signification of “morning” as being the Lord in respect to his Divine human, therefore “the morning star” means intelligence and wisdom from him. “Morning” is often mentioned in the Word, and its signification varies according to the connection in the internal sense; in the highest sense it signifies the Lord, and also his coming; in the internal sense it signifies his kingdom and church, and their state of peace. Moreover, it signifies the first state of a new church, and also a state of love, and a state of illumination, consequently a state of intelligence and wisdom, and also a state of the conjunction of good and truth, the state in which the internal man is conjoined to the external. “Morning” has such various significations, because in the highest sense it signifies the Lord’s"

And since all the intelligence and wisdom that the angels have comes from the Lord as their sun, their state of love, and state of wisdom and intelligence, and in general their state of illumination is signified by “morning”; for these proceed from the Lord as a sun, and what proceeds from him is himself, for from the Divine nothing but what is Divine goes forth, and everything Divine is himself.

In the second book of Samuel: The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spoke to me. He is as the light of the morning; the sun riseth, a morning without clouds (1 Sam. 23:3–4). “The God of Israel” and “the Rock” is the Lord in respect to the Divine human and Divine truth proceeding therefrom; “the God of Israel” because Israel is his spiritual church, and “the Rock” because his Divine in the spiritual church is Divine truth (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 3720, 6426, 8581, 10580).

(That “glory” is Divine truth as it is in heaven, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 4809, 5922, 8267, 8427, 9429; that “the house of God” is heaven and the church in respect to good, and “temple” is the same in respect to truth, n. 3720; and that the “east,” in the highest sense, is the Lord, because he is the sun of heaven, which is always in its rising and morning, consequently the “east” is the good of love from him, see n. 3708, 5097, 9668.)

Here also, the influx of the Lord from his Divine human with those who are of his kingdom and church is described by pure correspondences. By “waters issuing out from under the threshold of the house towards the east,” Divine truth proceeding from the Lord and flowing in with those that are in the east, that is, that are in the good of love to him, is described. “The waters shall descend into the plain” and “into the sea,” and “thereby the waters of the sea are healed,” signifies influx into the natural man and into the knowledges which are therein; the “fishes therefrom” signifies many truths in the natural man; that “everything shall live whither the river shall come” signifies that they should have life from Divine truth.

This is evident from what is written to the angel of this church, from which, when viewed in the internal or spiritual sense, it can be seen that those who live a moral but not a spiritual life, because they have little regard for the knowledges of the spiritual things and for intelligence and wisdom therefrom, are here treated of. But before unfolding the things that follow as to their spiritual sense, it is necessary to explain and open what moral life is and what spiritual life is, also what moral life from spiritual life is, and what moral life apart from spiritual life. Moral life is acting well, sincerely, and justly with one’s companions in all the affairs and occupations of life; in a word, it is the life that is apparent before men, because it is the life lived with them. But this life has a two-fold origin; it is either from the love of self and the world, or it is from love to God and love towards the neighbor. [2] Moral life from the love of self and the world is not in itself moral life, although it seems to be moral; for the man acting thus acts well, sincerely, and justly for the sake of self and the world only, and what is good, sincere, and just serves him as means to an"

From this it can be seen that there lies within the moral life of such a man nothing else than to acquire all things in preference to others, thus that he wishes to have all others to serve him, or to gain possession of their goods; from which it is evident that his moral life is not in itself a moral life; for if he should gain what he aims at, or what he has as an end, he would subject others to himself as slaves, and would deprive them of their goods. And as all means savor of the end, and in their essence are of the same quality as their ends, for which reason they are also called intermediate ends, therefore such a life, regarded in itself, is merely craftiness and fraud. And this also becomes clearly evident in the case of those with whom these external bonds are released, as takes place, when engaged in lawsuits against their fellows, when they desire nothing so much as to subvert justice, and secure the good will of the judge or the favor of the king, and this secretly, that they may deprive others of their goods; and when they obtain this, they rejoice in spirit and in heart. This is still more evident in the case of kings who place honor in wars and victories, that they find the highest joy of their hearts in subjugating provinces and kingdoms, and where resistance is made, in depriving the vanquished of all their goods, and even of life. Such also is the delight of many who engage at such times in military service. This becomes still more evident with all of this character when they become spirits, which is immediately after the death of the body. As they then think and act from their spirit, they rush into every wickedness according to their love, however morally they may have lived in appearance while in the world. [3] But spiritual life is wholly different, because it has a different origin; for it is from love to God and love towards the neighbor. Consequently, the moral life also of those who are spiritual is different, and is a truly moral life; for these, when they think in their spirit, which takes place when they are thinking secretly by themselves, do not think from self and the world, but from the"

The moral life of such persons is, in appearance, like the moral life of those described above, and yet their moral life is spiritual, because it is from a spiritual origin. Their moral life is simply an effect of spiritual life, which is the efficient cause, thus the origin. For they act well, sincerely, and justly with their fellows from fear of God and from love of the neighbor; in these loves the Lord keeps their mind and disposition (mentem et animum); consequently when they become spirits, which takes place when the body dies, they think and act intelligently and wisely, and are elevated into heaven. Of these it may be said, that with them every good of love and every truth of faith flows in out of heaven, that is, through heaven from the Lord. But this is not true of those described above; for their good is not the good of heaven, nor is their truth the truth of heaven; but what they call good is the delight of the lust of the flesh, and it is falsity therefrom that they call truth; these flow into them from self and from the world. From this it can also be known what moral life from spiritual life is, and what moral life apart from spiritual life is; namely, that moral life from spiritual life is truly moral life, which may be called spiritual, since it has its cause and origin in the spiritual; but that moral life apart from spiritual life not moral life, and may be called infernal, for so far as the love of self and of the world reign in it, so far it is fraudulent and hypocritical. [4] From what has now been said, the quality of external sanctity may also be inferred (by which is meant worship in churches, prayers, and gestures then), with such as are in the love of self and of the world, and yet live an apparently moral life, namely, that nothing of these is elevated to heaven and is heard there, but that they flow out from some thought of the external or natural man, and thus from their mouth into the world.

But worship with those who live a moral life from a spiritual origin is altogether different, for it is truly a worship of God, for their prayers are elevated to heaven and are heard, for the Lord leads their prayers through heaven to Himself. (But more;may be seen on these subjects in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 468, 484, 529, 530–534; and above, in the explanation of Revelation, n. 107.) These things are premised, because what is written to the angel of this church treats of those who live a moral but not a spiritual life, for the reason that they have little regard for the knowledges of spiritual things. 183a. These things saith He that hath the seven spirits of God, signifies the Lord from whom are all the truths of heaven and of the church. This may appear from the fact that it is the Lord who is meant, because it is the Son of man who said these things, as well as those said to the angels of the other churches; and the Son of man is the Lord in respect to the Divine Human (see n. 63, 151). By “the seven spirits of God” all the truths of heaven and of the church are meant, because “the Spirit of God” in the Word signifies Divine truth proceeding from the Lord. “Spirit” is mentioned in many passages in the Word, and “spirit,” when used in reference to man, signifies Divine truth received in the life, thus it signifies man’s spiritual life; but in reference to the Lord, by “spirit” is meant the Divine that proceeds from Him, which is called by the general term Divine truth. But since few at this day know what is meant by “spirit” in the Word, I will first show by passages from the Word that “spirit,” in reference to man, signifies Divine truth received in the life, thus man’s spiritual life. But because there are two things that constitute man’s spiritual life, namely, the good of love and the truth of faith, in many passages in the Word mention is made of “heart and spirit,” and also of “heart and soul;” and by “heart” the good of love is signified, and by “spirit” the truth of faith; the letter is also signified by “soul,” for this means in the Word man’s spirit."

And in David: Create for me a clean heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit in the midst of me. The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and contrite heart God doth not despise (Ps. 51:10, 17). In these passages “heart” signifies the good of love, and “spirit” the truth of faith, from which man has spiritual life; for there are two things that make all of man’s life, namely, good and truth; these two when united in man make his spiritual life. [3] As “heart” signifies good, and “spirit” truth, both received in the life, so “heart,” in the contrary sense, signifies evil, and “spirit” falsity; for most expressions in the Word have also a contrary sense. In this sense “heart” and “spirit” are mentioned, in David: A generation that doth not set his heart aright, neither is his spirit steadfast with God (Ps. 78:8).

In Ezekiel: Woe unto the foolish prophets that go away after their own spirit (13:3). That which ascendeth upon your spirit shall never come to pass (20:32). [4] From this it is clear that the whole of man’s life is meant by “heart and spirit;” and as his whole life refers itself to these two, namely, to good and truth, and in a spiritual sense to love and faith, so these two lives of man are meant by “heart and spirit.” From this also it is that “heart and spirit” signify the will and the understanding of man; since these two faculties in man make all his life; nowhere else than in these has man life; and for the reason that the will is the receptacle of good and its love, or of evil and its love; and the understanding is the receptacle of truth and its faith, or of falsity and its faith; and as has been said, all things with man refer themselves to good and truth, or to evil and falsity, and in a spiritual sense to love and faith (see the Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, n. 28–35). In reference to man, “spirit” signifies truth or falsity, and man’s life from one or the other; because by “spirit” is meant especially the spirit that is in man and that thinks, and it thinks’ either from truths or from falsities. But as was said just above, there are two things that make the life of man, understanding and will; the life of the understanding is to think either from truths or from falsities, and the life of the will is to affect or inflame with love those things that the understanding thinks. These two lives of man correspond to the two lives of his body, which are the life of the respiration of the lungs, and the life of the pulse of the heart; it is by this correspondence that spirit and body with man are united (see above, n. 167; and in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 446, 447).

The spirit of the Lord Jehovih is upon me, therefore Jehovah hath anointed me to preach good tidings to the poor (61:1). In John: He whom the Father hath sent speaketh the words of God, for not by measure hath God given the spirit (3:34). These things are said of the Lord. [9] That the Holy Spirit is Divine truth proceeding from the Lord can be seen in John: I tell you the truth; it is expedient for you that I go away; for if I go not away the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I go away I will send Him unto you. When He, the Spirit of truth, is come, He shall guide you into all truth; He shall not speak from Himself, but He shall take of Mine, and shall declare it unto you (16:7, 13, 14).

It is clear from this that the Holy Spirit is Divine truth, proceeding from the Lord, which flows in with man, both immediately from the Lord Himself and mediately through angels and spirits; for the Lord says first, that “he who believes on Him, out of His belly shall flow rivers of living water,” and then that “He spoke this of the spirit which they were to receive;” for “water” in the spiritual sense, signifies truth, and “rivers of living water,” Divine truth from the Lord in abundance; the like is therefore meant by “the spirit which they were to receive.” (That “water” signifies truth,” and “living water” Divine truth,” see above, n. 71.) And as Divine truth proceeds from the glorified Human of the Lord and not immediately from the Divine Itself, for this was glorified in Itself from eternity, so it is here said, “the Holy Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified.” That to “glorify” is to make Divine, and that the Lord fully glorified His Human, that is, made"

[11] It is greatly wondered at in heaven that the man of the church does not know that the Holy Spirit, which is Divine truth, proceeds from the Lord’s Human, and not immediately from His Divine, when yet the doctrine received in the whole Christian world teaches that: As is the Father so also is the Son, uncreate, infinite, eternal, omnipotent, God, Lord; neither of them first or last, nor greatest or least. Christ is God and man: God from the nature of the Father, and man from the nature of the mother; but although He is God and man, yet they are not two, but one Christ; He is one, but not by changing the Divine into the Human but the Divine took the Human to Itself. He is altogether one, not by a mingling of two natures, but He is a single person, because as body and soul are one man, so God and man is one Christ. (This from the Creed of Athanasius). Now as the Divine and the Human of the Lord are not two, but a single person, and are united as soul and body, it may be known that the Divine which is called the Holy Spirit goes out and proceeds from His Divine through the Human, thus from the Divine Human; for nothing whatever can go forth from the body except from the soul through the body, since all the life of the body is from its soul. And since “As is the Father so is the Son, uncreate, infinite, eternal, omnipotent, God and Lord, and neither of them is first or last, nor greatest nor least,” it follows that the proceeding Divine, which is called the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Divine Itself of the Lord through His Human, and not from another Divine that is called the Father; for the Lord teaches that the Father and He are one, and that the Father is in Him and He in the Father (see below, n. 200). But the reason why most of those in the Christian world think otherwise in their hearts, and thence believe otherwise, is, the angels said, because they think of the Lord’s Human as separate from His Divine, although this is contrary to the doctrine which teaches that the Divine and the Human of the Lord are not two persons, but a single person, united as soul and body. That this should be the doctrine of the whole Christian world was provided by the Lord, because it is the essential of the"

In Matthew: John said, I baptize you with water with repentance; but He that cometh after me, He shall baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire (3:11). In the spiritual sense, “to baptize” signifies to regenerate; the “Holy Spirit” is Divine truth, and “fire” Divine good. (That to “baptize” signifies to regenerate, see above, n. 71; and that “fire” signifies the good of love, n. 68.) [13] From this it can now be seen what is meant by the words of the Lord to His disciples: Go ye, baptize into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit (Matt. 28:19). Here “the Father” is the Divine Itself, “the Son” is the Divine Human, and “the Holy Spirit” is the proceeding Divine which is Divine truth; thus there is one Divine, and yet there is a trine.

These passages have been cited that it may be known that “the seven spirits” signify all the truths of heaven and of the church from the Lord. It is made still more manifest that “the seven spirits” are all the truths of heaven and of the church, from these passages in Revelation: The seven lamps of fire burning before the throne are the seven spirits of God (4:5).

I know thy works, signifies the things that are of their life. This is evident from the signification of “works,” as being the things that are of man’s life, both the good and the evil. “Works” signify the things that are of life because they are the effects of life, for they proceed from the life of everyone. If the life is good the works are good, but if the life is evil the works are evil. The life that is in works is the intention, which is of the will, and of the thought therefrom; and this life is the life of man’s spirit; for it is the spirit in man that intends and thinks. Without this life in works they would be only nations like those of automatons. For this reason the wise do not look at the works, but at the life that is in the works, namely, at the intention. This is especially true of the angels who are with man; they do not see his works, but only the intentions of his mind, and conclude therefrom what the man’s state is. From this it can be seen that “works” in the spiritual sense mean the life; and as the life of man is diverse, depending mainly upon his love, it is his love that is especially signified by “works” see above (n. 98, 116). This is why it is said to the angel of each church in the beginning, “1 know thy works;” which therefore means that the Lord knows the whole life of man, and its quality in respect to love. 186a. That thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead, signifies the quality of their thought, in that they think themselves to be alive, because they are living a moral life, when yet they are dead. This is evident from the signification of “name,” as being quality of state (see above, n. 148); also from the signification of “living,” as being to have spiritual life (of which presently); also from the signification of “being dead,” as being not to have spiritual life, but only moral life without it. This is “being dead,” because in the Word “life” signifies the life of heaven with man, which is there also called “life eternal;” while “death” signifies the life of hell, which life in the Word is called “death,” because it is the privation of the life of heaven. Here, therefore, “thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead,” signifies thinking that they have spiritual life, and thus are saved, because they are living a moral life, when yet"

But how this is to be understood can be seen from what was said above (n. 182) of each life, spiritual and moral, namely, that moral life apart from spiritual life is the life of the love of self and the love of the world, while moral life that is from spiritual life is a life of love to the Lord and love towards the neighbor; this life is the life of heaven, but the other life is what is called spiritual death. When this is understood (see above, n. 182,) it can be known what is meant here by “being alive and yet being dead.” [2] That “to live,” or “being alive,” signifies spiritual life in man, and “being dead” deprivation of that life, and damnation, can be seen from many passages in the Word, of which I will cite the following. Thus in Ezekiel: When I shall say unto the wicked, In dying he shall die, and thou shalt not give him warning, nor speak to warn the wicked one from his evil way, that he may be made alive, the wicked shall die in his iniquity. But if thou shalt give warning to the wicked, and he shall not turn back from his wickedness nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; yet hast thou delivered thy soul. So if thou shalt give warning to a righteous man that he sin no more, and he sin not, living he shall live, because he took warning (3:18–21). Here “dying he shall die” is to perish in eternal death, which is damnation, for it is said of the wicked; and “living he shall live” is to enjoy eternal life, which is salvation, for it is said of those who repent, and of the righteous. [3] In the same: Ye have profaned Me with My people, to kill the souls that should not die, and to keep alive the souls that should not live, whilst ye lie to My people, to them that hear a lie (13:19). This treats of the falsification of truth, which is meant by “Ye have profaned Me with My people,” and by “ye lie to the people, to them that hear a lie.” Here “a lie” signifies what is false, and what is falsified. “To kill the souls that should not die” is to deprive them of the life that comes from truths; and “to keep alive the souls that"

[4] In David: Behold the eye of Jehovah is upon them that fear Him, to deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in famine (Ps. 33:18, 19). Thou hast delivered my soul from death, and my feet from stumbling, that I may walk before God in the light of the living (Ps. 56:13). In Jeremiah: Behold, I set before you the way of life and the way of death (21:8). In John: Jesus said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that heareth My Word hath eternal life, and shall not come into condemnation, but shall pass from death into life (5:24). [5] It is clear that in these passages “death” means damnation and “life” salvation. Because “death” is damnation it is also hell, for which reason hell is commonly called “death” in the Word, as in these passages. In Isaiah: Hell will not confess Thee, nor will death praise Thee; they that go down into the pit will not hope on Thy truth. The living, the living, he shall confess Thee (38:18, 19).

These are meant also in the following passages. In David: They joined themselves also unto Baal-peor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead (Ps. 106:28).

In Matthew: Narrow is the gate and straitened is the way which leadeth unto life (7:14). It is good to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into the hell of fire (18:9). In the same: If thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments (19:17).

In David: Jehovah, with Thee is the founta in of life, in Thy light shall we see light (Ps. 36:9). The light which is life from the Lord in heaven is there called Divine truth, because it shines in the minds of those who are there, and thence shines before their eyes. From this it is that in the Word “light” signifies Divine truth, and intelligence and wisdom therefrom, and that the Lord Himself is called “the Light.” (But this is shown more fully in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 126–140, 275, which see.)

This life is meant by “wakefulness” and “being awake,” because spiritual life is to moral life, apart from spiritual life, as wakefulness is to sleep, or as noonday light is to the evening, yea, to darkness. But that this is so is not known or perceived by those who are in natural life alone, neither by those who are in moral life apart from spiritual life, for this life also is natural life. They do not know or perceive this, because they are in natural lumen only, and this lumen in comparison with spiritual light is as the darkness of evening to the light of noonday. Moreover, to such the darkness of evening seems like light; for their interior sight, which is that of the thought, is adapted to that darkness, just as the sight of owls, bats, and other birds that fly by night, is adapted to the shade. Consequently they believe themselves to be in light because they are able to reason, when yet they are in darkness. That this is so is manifest from the state of such after death, when they become spirits. They then believe, when with their companions, that they are in light, because they not only see all things that are about them, but also are able to think and speak about any matter whatever; and yet their light, when the light of heaven flows in with them, is changed into darkness, and they become so blind in respect to the understanding as not to be able to think at all. Moreover, when angels who are in the heavens look down on those who are in such lumen, they see nothing there but mere darkness. That spiritual life compared with moral life apart from spiritual life is as wakefulness compared with sleep, can be further seen from this, that those who are in spiritual light are in angelic wisdom and intelligence, which is such as to be incomprehensible and ineffable to those who are in natural lumen alone, and this not only with men while living in the world, but also with the same when after death they become spirits; and when intelligence and wisdom constitute wakefulness. From this it can now be seen that “Be wakeful” here signifies that they should procure for themselves spiritual life. 187b. [2] To “be awake” has a similar signification in the following passages. In Matthew: Be awake, therefore, for ye know not in what hour your Lord cometh (24:42)."

What I say unto you I say unto all, Be awake (13:35–37). He that is ignorant of the internal sense of the Word may believe that these words refer to the last judgment, and that everyone should he prepared for that; but man’s state it respect to love and faith when he dies is what they refer to, for then is his judgment. “Evening,” “night,” and “cock-crowing” signify such states; “evening” signifying a state of waning faith and charity, which is man’s state when he comes into the exercise of his own judgment, and is extinguishing in himself the things that he imbibed in childhood; “night” signifying a state of no faith and charity; “cock- crowing” or “daybreak” the state when faith and charity are beginning, which is, when man loves truths and wishes to be reformed by them. In whatever state a man dies he remains, and according to that he is judged. From this it is evident what is meant by “Be ye awake, lest the Lord coming suddenly find you sleeping. What I say unto you I say unto all, Be awake,” namely, that “to be awake” means to receive life from the Lord, which life is spiritual life, and that “sleeping” means living a natural life apart from a spiritual life. (That “evening” signifies a state of waning faith and charity, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 3056, 3197, 3833, 8431, 10134, 10135; “night” a state of no faith or charity, n. 221, 709, 2353, 6000, 7870, 7947; and “daybreak” before morning, or “cock- crowing,” the state when faith and charity are beginning, n. 10134.) [3] In Luke: Blessed are those servants whom the Lord when He cometh shall find awake; verily I say unto you, He shall gird himself, and make them recline to eat, and drawing near will minister unto them. Be ye ready; for in an hour that ye think not the Son of man will come (12:37, 40)."

His “girding himself, making them recline to eat, and drawing near to minister unto them,” signifies to communicate to them the goods of heaven, which are all from the Lord. [4] In Matthew: The kingdom of the heavens is like unto ten virgins, five of them were prudent, and five were foolish. While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept; but the bridegroom coming, they all arose and trimmed their lamps. And when the foolish came, who had no oil in their lamps, and said, Lord, Lord, open to us, the Lord answered, I say unto you, I know you not. Be awake, therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh (25:1–13). By “the ten virgins” all who are of the church are meant; by “five” some of them are meant; this is what these numbers signify; by “lamps” the things of faith are signified; by “oil” the things of love. By “the five prudent virgins,” therefore, those who are in love and in faith therefrom are meant; but by “the five foolish virgins” those who are in no love, but in faith alone. As such are in no spiritual life (for only those who are in love and charity have spiritual life, because they only are in faith), so because such as these are shut out of heaven, it is said unto them, “I say unto you, I know you not.” From this it is most evident what is signified by “Be awake, therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh,” namely, that they should receive spiritual life, which those have who are in love and in faith therefrom. (But these things may be seen more fully explained in Arcana Coelestia, n. 4635–4638.) [5] In Luke:"

Blessed is he that is awake, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked (16:15). Here “to be awake” signifies to receive spiritual life from the Lord, as is evident from its being said, “Blessed is he that is awake and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked;” “garments” signifying the knowledges of truth and good by means of which man has spiritual life; and “to walk naked” signifying life without such knowledges as means, thus life not spiritual but merely natural. (That “garments” signify the knowledges of truth and good, see below, n. 195, and that by “naked” is signified the deprivation of these, sec Arcana Coelestia, n. 1073, 5433, 5954, 9960.) [7] In Lamentations: Arise, cry aloud in the night, at the beginning of the watches; lift up thy hands to the Lord respecting the soul of thy babes, who have fainted through hunger at the head of every street (2:19); here, as above, “night” signifies a state of no faith; “the beginning of the watches” signifies the state when faith begins, thus a state of illustration, which is when man becomes spiritual. By “babes” are meant those who love truths, and long for them; “to faint through hunger at the head of every street” is to be deprived of spiritual life through a lack of the knowledges of truth and good. (That “hunger” means a lack of knowledges and a longing for them, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 1460, 3364, 5277, 5279, 5281, 5300, 5360, 5376, 5893; and that “streets” are the truths of doctrine, n. 2336.)"

This is what “sleeping” signifies in Matthew: The kingdom of the heavens is like unto a man that sowed good seed in his field; but while men slept the enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat (13:24, 25). In Jeremiah: When they have grown warm, I will set their feasts, and I will make them drunken, that they may sleep the sleep of an age, and not awake (51:39, 57). In David: Look! answer me, Jehovah my God! lighten Thine eyes lest I sleep death (Ps. 13:3). The strong in heart have become a spoil, they have slumbered their sleep; at Thy rebuke both the chariot and the horse have fallen into a deep sleep (Ps. 76:5, 6). “Chariot and horse” signify the doctrine of the church and the understanding of doctrine; these are said “to fall into a deep sleep” when they are without truths, and when consequently the man of the church is without spiritual life by means of truths. (That “chariots and horses” in the Word signify doctrine and the intellectual, see in the small work on The White Horse, n. 1–5.) 188. And confirm the things remaining that are about to die, signifies in order that the things that belong to the moral life may be vivified. This is evident from the signification of “confirming,” as being to vivify the moral life by means of truths; for truths from the Word are what vivify it; and when it is vivified it is also confirmed, for it then acts as one with the spiritual life; for spiritual life and moral life act as one with those who are spiritual, as will"

It is said, “confirm the things remaining that are about to die,” which signifies lest the moral life be destroyed by evils and falsities; for moral life apart from spiritual life is nothing else than natural life; since all the good things that man does from a moral life, apart from the spiritual, are from no other origin than from the love of self and the world, that is, from the proprium [one’s own], and from the proprium nothing flows out except evil and falsity; man, indeed, wishes to be esteemed moral, because by feigning goodness, sincerity, and righteousness in outward form, he may gain ends that have respect to self and the world. From this it is that all things that are with him are in themselves dead, that is, are “about to die,” unless they are made alive by truths and goods, which may bring about an opening of the internal spiritual man; for it is by this means that the Lord takes away the evils and falsities that are in the natural. 189. For I have not found thy works full before God, signifies that otherwise the Divine is not in the moral life. This is evident from the signification of “works,” as being the things of life (of which see above, n. 185); here of moral life, because that is here treated of; also from the signification of “not full before God,” as being that the Divine is not in that life. The things of moral life, which are here signified by “works,” are said to be “full before God,” when they are from a spiritual origin, but “not full” when they are not from that origin; for moral life, which is the external life of man, must be either from a spiritual origin or from an origin not spiritual; it is not permitted to be from both, that is, something of it from one origin and something from the other, or something from heaven and something from hell, since this would be to “serve two masters, God and Mammon;” and then the man is “lukewarm, neither cold nor hot.” “Works,” therefore, must be either “full before God,” or they are nothing before God. This is why “I have not found thy works full before God” signifies that the Divine is not in the moral life. The meaning is the same whether it is said a moral life from a spiritual origin or from the Divine, since all spiritual life is from the Divine, for the spiritual means the same as the proceeding Divine, and is the Divine truth in heaven; and all angels of heaven, because they are recipients of this, are spiritual;"

Remember, therefore, how thou hast received and heard, and take heed, signifies recalling to mind what the Lord teaches in the Word and attention. This is evident from this, that what is written to the angel of this church treats of those who are in a moral, and not in a spiritual life; and these are here told to acquire for themselves spiritual life, that their moral life may be made alive, which is signified by the words just preceding, “Be wakeful, and confirm the things remaining that are about to die;” from which it can be seen that “Remember, therefore, how thou hast received and heard, and take heed,” signifies recalling to mind what the Lord teaches in the Word, and attention. “To take heed” signifies attention, as it is with those who are in the spiritual affection of truth; for when these read the Word they do not look at it from the doctrine of the church in which they are born, but they look at it as if they were separated from that doctrine; for their wish is to be illustrated, and to see truths inwardly in themselves, and not from others. Those who are in such a state are illustrated by the Lord, and it is granted to them to make doctrine for themselves out of the truths that they see; and this doctrine is implanted in them, and abides in their spirit to eternity. [2] But those who read the Word from the doctrine received from others are not able to see truths in the light of their own spirit, thus not inwardly in themselves, but only outside of themselves; for they think that a thing is true because others have seen it, and therefore they attend only to what corroborates it; other things they pass by as if not seen, or they bring them over to the support of what their doctrine declares. Such as these cannot be illustrated, as anyone can see; for they only store up confirmations in the memory, which belongs to their natural man, and from this memory they henceforth speak; consequently they stay natural as before, and do not become spiritual; for to become spiritual is to imbue one’s spirit with truths from the Word; and the spirit is not imbued with truths except as it desires to know truth wherever it is"

These words signify also the unexpected time of death, because death comes unexpectedly, and after death man remains to eternity in the state of that life which he acquired for himself in the world; for this reason man must be wakeful. As it is known to few that all the knowledges gained from the Word that have not acquired spiritual life are taken away, it is necessary to explain how this is done.

There are two states of man, one when he thinks from his spirit, and the other when he thinks from the memory of his body; when these two states do not make one, man can think in one way by himself, and can think and speak in another way with others. [2] Take a preacher, for instance, who loves himself and the world above all things, and cares nothing for the Divine, even so that he denies it in heart, and therefore schemes evils of every kind, in consort with the crafty and malignant of the world; and yet when he is speaking with others, especially when he is preaching, he may be able to speak as from zeal for the Divine, and for Divine truths, and even at such times may be able to think in like manner; but this state is a state of his thought from the memory of the body, and is evidently separated from the state of his thought from the spirit, since when left to himself he thinks contrary to these things. This is the state that remains with man after death, but the other state does not remain, because it belongs to his body and not to his spirit; consequently when he becomes a spirit, which takes place when he dies, all knowledges that he acquired for himself from the Word that do not agree with the life of his spirit’s love, he casts away from him. But it is otherwise with those who, when left to themselves alone, think justly about the Divine, about the Word and the truths of the church therefrom, and who love truths even to the life, that is, so that they wish to live according to them. The thoughts of these in their spirit make one with their thoughts from the memory of the body, thus they make one with the knowledges of truth and good which they have from the Word; and so far as these make one, these knowledges receive spiritual life, for they are elevated by the Lord from the external or natural man into the internal or spiritual man, and constitute the life, that is, the understanding and will, of the spiritual man. Truths, in the spiritual man, are living truths, because they are Divine, and from these man has life there.

The same is meant by the following in Revelation: Behold I come as a thief; blessed is he that is wakeful, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked (16:15); it is said “as a thief” because evils and falsities therefrom in the natural man take away and cast out the knowledges of truth and good that are there from the Word; for the things that are not loved are cast out. With man there is either the love of evil and of falsity therefrom, or the love of good and of truth therefrom. These two loves are opposite to one another; consequently he who is in one of them cannot be in the other, for “no one can serve two masters,” without loving the one and hating the other (Matt. 6:24). [4] Because evils and falsities therefrom penetrate from within, and break through as it were the wall that is between the state of man’s thought from the spirit and the state of his thought from the body, and cast out the knowledges of truth and good that have their abode with man in his outward part, therefore such evils and falsities are what are meant by “thieves,” also in the following passages. In Matthew: Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon the earth, but in heaven, where thieves do not dig through nor steal (6:19, 20). “Treasures” are the knowledges of truth and good; “laying them up in heaven” is in the spiritual man, for the spiritual man is in heaven. (That “treasures” are the knowledges of truth and good, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 1694, 4508, 10227; and that the internal spiritual man is in heaven, see The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem. n. 36-50.)"

This means that if man knew the hour of his death he would get himself ready, not from a love of what is true and good, but from a fear of hell; and whatever a man does from fear does not remain with him, but what he does from love remains; therefore he should be getting ready all the time (see the Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, n. 143, 168). [6] In Obadiah: If thieves come to thee, if robbers by night, how wilt thou be cut off! will they not steal till they have enough? (verse 5). Here also falsities and evils are called “thieves,” and are said to “steal;” falsities are “thieves,” and evils are “robbers by night;” it is said “by night,” because “night” signifies a state of no love and faith.

The “iniquity of Ephraim” signifies the falsities of the understanding; and the “evils of Samaria” the evils of the will; “to make a lie” is thinking and willing falsity from evil; “the thief” is falsity taking away and dissipating truth; and “the troop spreading itself” is evil casting out good. (That “Ephraim” is the intellectual of such things as are of the church, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 3969, 5354, 6222, 6234, 6238, 6267, 6296; that “a lie” is falsity from evil, n. 8908, 9248; that “a troop” is good casting out evil, and in a contrary sense, evil casting out good, n. 3934, 3935, 6404, 6405.) 193b. [9] These things are adduced that it may be known what “a thief” in the word signifies, namely, falsity vastating, that is, taking away and destroying truth. It was shown above, that after death all knowledges of truth and good from the Word that have not acquired spiritual life are taken away; consequently they are taken away from those who have not been made spiritual by knowledges from the Word. The same is signified by many other things in the historical parts of the word; but this no one can see unless he knows the spiritual sense of the Word. This was signified by the sons of Israel’s borrowing from the Egyptians gold, and silver, and garments, and thus taking them away as it were by theft, which is thus described in Moses: It was commanded that they should borrow of the Egyptians vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and raiment.

[10] That the knowledges of truth and good from the Word will be taken away from those who have not acquired spiritual life for themselves, is also meant in the Lord’s parables respecting the talents and pounds given to the servants that they might trade and make gain, and respecting the servant who traded not and gained nothing, of whom it is written in the parables: Unto him who hid his talent in the earth his lord said, Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou oughtest to have put my silver to the bankers, in order that at my coming I might have received mine own with interest. Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him that hath the ten talents. For unto everyone that hath shall be given, that he may have abundance; but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath. And cast ye out the unprofitable servant into outer darkness (Matt. 25:14–30). He came who had received the one pound, saying, Lord, behold, here is thy pound, which I kept laid up in a napkin. The lord said, Wherefore gavest not thou my money into the bank, that coming I might have regained mine own with interest. And He said, Take from him the pound, and give to him that hath ten pounds. I say unto you, To everyone that hath shall be given; but from him that hath not, even than which he hath shall be taken away from him (Luke 19:13–26).

He who his knowledges from the Word in the memory only, even if they were thousands, if he has not committed them to the life, remains natural as before. Committing knowledges from the Word to the life is thinking from them, when one, left to himself, thinks from his spirit, and also willing them and doing them; for this is loving truths because they are truths; and those who do this are those who become spiritual by means of knowledges from the Word. 194. And thou shalt not know in what hour I will come upon thee, signifies ignorance of that time and of the state then. This is evident from the signification of “hour,” as being the time when man is to die, and also his state then; and from the signification of “not knowing” it, as being ignorance. It is said “In what hour I will come upon thee,” namely, “as a thief,” and this means, in the sense of the letter, that the Lord will so come; but in the spiritual sense, it means that evils and falsities will steal away the knowledges that they have from the Word. For in the sense of the letter of the Word doing evil is attributed to Jehovah, or to the Lord, but in the spiritual sense the meaning is that He does evil to no one, but that man does evil to himself (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 2447, 5798, 6071, 6991, 6997, 7533, 7632, 7643, 7679, 7710, 7877, 7926, 8227, 8228, 8284, 8483, 8632, 9010, 9128, 9306, 10431).

These “hours” mean, in the world, times, but in heaven, states of life, since in heaven there are no hours, because times there are not measurable and divided into days and these into hours, as in the world; consequently instead of these times the angels perceive the states of life of those who die, as old men, men, youths, or children, and who have equally acquired for themselves spiritual life; “laboring in the vineyard” is acquiring for oneself spiritual life by the knowledges of truth and good from the Word applied to the uses of life; the “third,” the “sixth,” and the “ninth hours” signify a like state of life, for all numbers in the Word are significative, and these numbers have a similar signification. (That “vineyard” in the Word signifies the spiritual church, and with man spiritual life, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 9139, 3220. That “three” signifies a full state, or what is complete even to the end, n. 2788, 4495, 7715, 8347, 9825; likewise “six” and “nine.” But “eleven” signifies a state not yet full, and yet a receptive state such as there is with well- disposed children and infants.

That all numbers in the Word are significative, n. 4495, 4670, 5265, 6175, 9488, 9659, 10217, 10253; and that composite numbers have a signification like that of the simple numbers from which they arise by multiplication, thus “three,” “six,” and “nine,” have a similar signification, n. 5291, 5335, 5708, 7973.) [3] Since “twelve” signifies truths and goods in their fullness, thus man’s state of light or intelligence from these, the Lord says: Are there not twelve hours of the day?

The times here mentioned mean the states of evil with man, as will be seen in the explanation of these words hereafter. From this it is now evident that “Thou shalt not know in what hour I will come upon thee,” means not only that one is ignorant of the time of death but also of the state of life at that time which will continue to eternity; for such as the state of man’s past life is, even to the end, such he remains to eternity. [4] Like things are said by the Lord here and there in the Evangelists. In Matthew: Ye know not in what hour your Lord will come; be ye ready; for in an hour that ye think not, the Son of man cometh (24:42, 44). The lord of the servant shall come in the day when he expecteth not, and in an hour that he knoweth not (24:50). Be wakeful, therefore, for ye know not the day, neither the hour, wherein the Son of man shall come (25:13). It should be known that man remains to eternity such as his whole life is, even to the end, and by no means such as he is at the hour of death; repentance at that time with the evil is of no avail, but with the good it strengthens. 195a. Verse 4. Thou hast a few name even in Sardis that have not defiled their garments, signifies those who live a moral life from a spiritual origin, by applying the knowledges of truth and good from the word to the uses of their life. This is evident from the signification of “name,” as being the quality of the state of man’s life (see above, n. 148); here, therefore, “names” signify men who are such. It is evident also from the signification of “the church in Sardis,” as being those who live a moral life but not a spiritual life, because they have little regard for the knowledges of truth and good from the Word (see also above, n. 148, 182); but here those are"

From this it is clear that “Thou hast a few names even in Sardis that have not defiled their garments,” signifies such as live a moral life from a spiritual origin, by applying the knowledges of truth and good from the Word to their life. [2] But as few know what it is to live a moral life from a spiritual origin, and what it is to apply the knowledges of truth and good from the Word to the uses of their life, it shall be told. Man lives a moral life from a spiritual origin when he lives it from religion; that is, when he thinks, when anything evil, insincere, or unjust presents itself; that this must not be done because it is contrary to the Divine laws. When one abstains from doing such things in deference to Divine laws he acquires for himself spiritual life, and his moral life is then from the spiritual; for by such thoughts and faith man communicates with the angels of heaven, and by communication with heaven his internal spiritual man is opened, the mind of which is a higher mind, such as the angels of heaven have, and he is thereby imbued with heavenly intelligence and wisdom. From this it can he seen that to live a moral life from a spiritual origin is to live from religion, and within the church, to live from the Word; for those who live a moral life from religion and from the Word are elevated above their natural man, thus above what is their own (proprium), and are led by the Lord through heaven; consequently they have faith, the fear of God, and conscience, and also the spiritual affection of truth, which is the affection of the knowledges of truth and good from the Word, for to such men these are Divine laws, according to which they live. Many of the heathen live such a moral life, for they think that evil must not be done because it is contrary to their religion; this is why so many of them are saved."

And as they think insincerely and unjustly regarding the neighbor, although they speak and act otherwise, their internal spiritual man is closed, and the internal natural man only is opened; and when this is open they are in the light of the world, but not in the light of heaven. For this reason such persons have in them little regard for Divine and heavenly things, and some deny them, believing nature and the world to be everything. (From this it can now be seen what it is to live a moral life from a spiritual origin, and what it is to live it from a natural origin; but these things may be seen set forth in clearer light in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 528–535.) Of those who live a moral life from a natural origin only, it may be said that they “defile their garments,” for “garments”’mean that which is outside the man himself and which clothes him, thus his natural man with the things that are in it, which are knowledges (scientifica) and cognitions; and when these are from the Word they are defiled by the fact that he learns and holds them only for the sake of reputation, that he may be thought learned or yell informed, or that he may thereby acquire honors and gain wealth; and except for such ends he has no regard for them. Thus it is that the knowledges from the Word are polluted and defiled by the loves of self and the world, for these knowledges dwell in the same place with the evils and falsities that gush out from those loves as from their fountains. [4] It was said above, that man becomes spiritual by means of the knowledges of truth and good from the Word applied to the uses of life. Why men become spiritual by means of knowledges from the Word, and not by means of other knowledges, shall now be told. All things that are in the Word are Divine, and they are Divine for the reason that they have in them a spiritual sense, and by that sense communicate with heaven and with the angels there. When, therefore, man has knowledges from the Word and applies them to life, then through these he has communication with heaven and by that communication becomes spiritual; for man becomes spiritual by his being in like or in corresponding truths with the angels of"

It is said in corresponding truths, because each and all things in the sense of the letter of the Word are correspondences, for they correspond to the truths that angels have. But the knowledges derived from other books, which set forth and by various means establish the doctrines of the church, do not effect communication with heaven except by the knowledges from the Word they contain; such knowledges do give communication if they are rightly understood and are applied to life, and not to faith alone. Everyone can see that this is so from this, that the Word in itself is Divine, and what is Divine in itself can become Divine with man by his applying it to life. Becoming Divine with man means that the Lord can have His abode with man (John 14:23), thus dwelling with him in what is His own (that the Lord dwells in His own with man and angel, and not in what is their own (proprio illorum), see in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 12). The Lord dwells in His own when He dwells in those things with man that are from the Word, for the Lord is the Word (John 1:1, 2, 14); and the words that He spoke, that is, that are in the Word: Are spirit and life (John 6:63, 68; 12:50). 195b. [5] That “garments” signify the things that are in the natural man, which are knowledges (scientifica), true or false, or cognitions, is from the spiritual world; for in the spiritual world all, however many, appear clothed according to their moral life; consequently those who have lived a moral life from a spiritual origin appear clothed in shining white garments, like fine linen; but those who have lived a moral life from a natural origin only, appear according to the nature of that life, those who have polluted their life by evils and falsities appearing in dark garments, mean, torn, and hideous to behold (see the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 177–182). From this now it is that “garments” in the Word signify truths from good, and in the contrary sense falsities from evil, both of them in the natural man; truths and falsities in the natural man are called knowledges (scientifica) and cognitions. [6] That “garments” in the Word signify truths or falsities can be clearly seen from the following passages. In Isaiah:"

The “garments of splendor that Jerusalem must put on” are Divine truths; the “uncircumcised and the unclean that shall not come to them” are those who are in evils and falsities. [7] In Ezekiel: Jerusalem, I clothed thee with broidered work, I shod thee with badger’s skin, I girded thee about with fine linen. I adorned thee with ornament, and I put bracelets upon thy hands, and a chain on thy throat, and a jewel upon thy nose, and earrings upon thine ears, yea, a crown of ornament upon thy head. Thus wast thou decked with gold and silver, and thy garments were fine linen, silk, and broidered work, whence thou becamest exceeding beautiful, and didst prosper even unto the kingdom. But thou didst take of thy garments, and didst make to thee high places with divers colors, that thou mightest commit whoredom upon them; thou also didst take garments of thy broidered work, and didst cover the images of a male, with which thou didst commit whoredom (16:10–13, 16–18). Here what the church was when it was first established by the Lord is described; the “garments” that are mentioned are truths from good; “broidered work” is true knowledges (scientificum); “fine linen and silk” are truth from a celestial source;the “bracelets,” “chain,” “jewel,” “earrings,” and “crown,” are decorations signifying things spiritual of various kinds; the “gold and silver” with which she was decked are the good of love and its truth. Then the same church when perverted is described, by this, that “she took of the garments, and did make to herself high places with divers colors,” signifying truths falsified; and that “she took the garments of broidered work, and covered the images of a male,” signifies that they applied the truths of the sense of the letter of the Word to so confirm falsities even so as to make them appear like truths; “committing whoredom with them” and “under them” signifies making doctrine and worship out of falsities (that this is to"

Dedan was thy merchant with garments of liberty for the chariot; Asshur and Chilmad with bales of blue and of broidered work, and with treasures of precious garments (27:7, 16, 20, 23, 24). Here Tyre and her wares are treated of, and “Tyre” signifies the knowledges of truth and good, and “trading” and “trafficking,” signify acquiring for oneself and communicating such knowledges; “purple and blue” signify the celestial love of good belonging to the natural man; by “broidered work from Egypt” the like; “Syria” the church in respect to the knowledges of truth and good; “Asshur” the rational of that church; “Dedan” those who are in the knowledges of celestial things. From this it can be seen that the “wares of Tyre,” treated of in the whole of that chapter, do not mean wares, but each and all these things mean spiritual things, which man ought to acquire, be imbued with, and communicate.

The “king’s daughter” signifies the spiritual affection of truth, and therefore the church consisting of those who are in that affection; “king” signifies the Lord in respect to Divine truth; “clothing inwrought with gold,” intelligence and wisdom from that truth; the “broidered work” in which she should “be brought to the king” signifies the knowledges of truth.

A “wedding garment” signifies the intelligence of the spiritual man, which is from the knowledges of truth and good; but “he that had not on a wedding garment” signifies a hypocrite, who by a moral life counterfeits the spiritual life when yet he is merely natural; “to bind him hand and foot” signifies the deprivation of the knowledges from the Word, by which he has put on the likeness of a spiritual man; “to be cast out into outer darkness” signifies among those who are in falsities from evil (for “outer darkness” signifies falsities from evil). [12] In Zephaniah : I will visit upon the princes, and upon the king’s sons, and upon all that are clothed with the garments of the alien (1:8). “Princes” and “king’s sons” signify those who are in truths, and in a contrary sense, as here, those who are in falsities; these are said to be “clothed with the garment of the alien,” because “garment” signifies falsity, and “alien” those who are out of the church and do not acknowledge the truths of the church.

[14] In John: Jesus said to Peter, When thou wast younger thou girdedst thyself and walkedst whither thou wouldest; but when thou shalt be old thou shalt stretch forth thy hands and another shall gird thee, and lead thee whither thou wouldest not (21:18). What these words signify in the spiritual sense may be seen above (n. 9); namely, that by “Peter” is meant the faith of the church; when he “was younger and girded himself and walked whither he would” means the faith of the church at the beginning, when men are in the good of charity, that they then think about the truths of the church from the spiritual man, which is to think from their spirit, thus from the spiritual affection of truth, that is, from freedom. But by “Peter when old, that he should stretch forth his hands and another should gird him,” is meant the faith of the church at its end, when faith would be without charity, that they then would think nothing about the truths of the church from themselves, but from others, thus from doctrine only and not from the Word, which is relatively a servile state. For to believe what another says is servile, but to believe what one himself thinks from the Word is freedom; according to the Lord’s words in John: If ye abide in My Word, ye are truly My disciples; and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free (8:31, 32).

The armies of the One sitting upon the white horse followed Him, clothed in fine linen, white and clean (19:14). They who stood before the throne in sight of the Lamb, were clothed in white robes (7:9). The seven angels from the temple were clothed in linen, clean and shining (15:6).

[18] That “garments” signify truths has its origin in this, that the light of heaven is Divine truth proceeding from the Lord us a sun there, and all things that have existence in the heavens have existence from the light there, and this is true in like manner of the garments in which the angels appear clothed.

In Moses: He will wash His vesture in wine, and His covering in the blood of grapes (Gen. 49:11). This is also said of the Lord. “Wine” and “the blood of grapes” signify Divine truth.

Here it is plainly declared that He who sat on the white horse was called “the Word of God;” and it is clear that this is the Lord, for it is immediately said of Him: He hath on His garment and on His thigh a name written, King of kings and Lord of lords (verse 16). It is therefore the Word in the letter that is signified by the “garment dipped in blood,” since violence was done to it, but not to the Word in the spiritual sense; violence could not be done to this, because they knew nothing about it. [21] That violence was done to the Word in the sense of the letter, but not to the Word in the spiritual sense, is signified also by the soldiers dividing the Lord’s garments, but not His tunic, of which it is said in John: The soldiers took His garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part, also the tunic. Now the tunic was without seam, woven from the top throughout. They said therefore one to another, Let us not divide it, but let us cast lots for it, whose it shall be. These things therefore the soldiers did (19:23, 24). And in David: They parted My garments, and cast the lot upon My vesture (Ps. 22:18). “The garments of the Lord which they parted” signify the Word in the letter; His “tunic” the Word in the spiritual sense; “soldiers”"

It should be known that each particular related in the Evangelists respecting the Lord’s passion, involves and signifies how the church at that time, which was among the Jews, had treated Divine truth, thus the Word, for this was Divine truth with them; the Lord also was the Word, because He was Divine truth (John 1:1, 2, 14). But what each particular involves and signifies cannot be known except from the internal sense. Here it will be told only what “the Lord’s garments” signified, because the meaning of “garments” is here treated of, namely, that they signify truths, and in reference to the Lord, Divine truths. [22] “The garments of Aaron and of his sons” have a like signification, because Aaron with his sons represented the Lord in respect to Divine good, and their garments the Lord in respect to Divine truth. (But these things may be seen explained and shown in the Arcana Coelestia; as that Aaron represented the Lord in respect to Divine good, n. 9806, 9946, 10017; also what each of their garments signified, the breastplate, the ephod, the cloak, the tunic wrought with checker work, the miter, and the belt, n. 9814, 9823–9828, seq.) 196. And they shall walk with Me in white, for they are worthy, signifies their spiritual life, which they have by means of the knowledges of truth and good from the Word. This is evident from the signification of “to walk,” as being to live (see above, n. 97); from the signification of “in white,” as being in truths, for “whiteness” and “brightness” in the Word are predicated of truths (of which presently); therefore by these words, “they shall walk with me in white,” is signified spiritual life, since spiritual life is the life of truth, that is, a life according to truths, or according to the precepts of the Lord in the Word.

So far as anyone receives from the Lord he is worthy; but so far as he receives from self, that is, from what is his, or from what is his own (proprium) he is not worthy. Nothing else constitutes spiritual life with man but the knowledges of truth and good from the Word applied to life; and they are applied to life when man holds them as the laws of his life, for he then looks to the Lord in everything, and with such the Lord is present, and gives intelligence and wisdom and an affection for them and delight in them. For the Lord is in His truths with man, since every truth proceeds from the Lord, and what proceeds from the Lord that is His, even so that it is He; therefore the Lord says: I am the truth and the life (John 14:6). He that doeth the truth cometh to the light, [that his works may be made manifest] that they have been wrought in God (John 3:21). The Word was with God, and God was the Word. In Him was life; and the life was the light of men. That was the true light, that lighteth every man. And the Word was made flesh (John 1:1, 4, 9, 14). The Lord is called “the Word” because the Word signifies Divine truth; He is also called “the Light” because Divine truth is the light in the heavens; He is also called “the Life,” because everything that lives, lives from that life; from that also angels have intelligence and wisdom, in which their life consists. He who would derive life from any other source than from the Divine that proceeds from the Lord, which in heaven is called Divine truth and is there seen as light, is greatly mistaken. From this it can be seen how it is to be understood that “God was the Word,” and that “in Him was life, and that the life was the light of men.” [2] “White” in the Word is predicated of truths, because Divine truth is the light of heaven, as was just said, and whiteness and brightness are from the light of heaven. From this it was: That when the Lord was transfigured before Peter, James, and John, His face appeared as the sun, and His garments as the light (Matt. 17:2);"

That Divine truth in ultimates has strength and power, n. 9836; that therefore the strength of Samson was in his hair, n. 3301.) [4] From this it is clear what is signified by “the Nazirites were whiter than snow and brighter than milk,” and “sapphire was the polishing of their bones; but their form was darkened, that they were not known in the streets;” for “whiteness” and “brightness” signify Divine truth in its light (as was said above); and “bones,” as they are man’s ultimates, being the supports of his whole body, correspond to ultimates in heaven. (For all things of man correspond, see in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 87–102; consequently “bones” signify the ultimates in the spiritual world, which are also the ultimates of Divine truth or the Word, Arcana Coelestia, n. 5560–5564, 8005; that “sapphire” signifies what is translucent from truths, n. 9407; and “not to be known in the streets” signifies that Divine truth is no more seen, since “streets” signify where there are truths of doctrine, n. 2336.) 197.

To see truths, and to see what they are, is of perception; and to live according to them is of reception; and according to perception and reception there is intelligence and wisdom. Intelligence and wisdom which are not from Divine truths, but from worldly things only, are not intelligence and wisdom but merely knowledge (scientia) and thence a faculty to reason; for intelligence is seeing inwardly in oneself whether a thing be true or not; but they who are wise from worldly things only do not see truths inwardly in themselves, but from others; and to see from others is merely to know (scire); and such things come no farther under the mind’s vision than that they may he confirmed. In such a state are most persons at this day within the church who make faith alone, separate from life, to be saving; consequently truths do not enter into their spirit, but merely into the memory of the natural man; and yet the light of heaven, which is Divine truth, can enter by no other way with man than by the way of his spirit which is also the way of his soul; and man’s spirit is such as his life is, but not such as his memory apart from his life is; and the light of heaven enters into man’s spirit when he is in the good of love and of charity from the Lord, and when he is in that good he is also in faith. (That man has no faith where there is no love or charity, see in the small work on the Last Judgment, n. 33–40. Moreover, what true intelligence is, what spurious, and what false, see in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 346–356.) 199.

From this it is that “the book of life” is that with man that corresponds to the heaven with him. Because this remains with man to eternity, if he has become spiritual by means of the knowledges of truth and good applied to life in the world, it is said, “I will not blot his name out of the book of life.” In the world indeed it may be blotted out if man does not remain spiritual to the end of life; but if he does so remain it cannot be blotted out, because he is conjoined to the Lord by love and faith, and such conjunction with the Lord as there has been in the world remains with man after death. [2] From this it can be seen that “the book of life” means that from the Lord which has been written on man’s spirit, that is, on his heart and soul, or what is the same, on his love and faith; and what is written by the Lord in man is heaven. From this it is clear what is meant by “the book of life” in the following passages. In Daniel: The Ancient of Days sat, and the books were opened (7:9, 10). The people shall be delivered, everyone that shall be found written in the book (12:1). In David: Let them be blotted out of the book of lives, and not be written with the righteous (Ps. 69:28).

And if any was not found written in the book of life he was cast into the lake of fire (20:12, 13, 15). There shall enter into the New Jerusalem only they that are written in the Lamb’s book of life (21:27). In David: My bone was not hidden from Thee when I was made in secret. Upon Thy book all the days were written in which they were formed, and not one of them is wanting (Ps. 139:15, 16). “All the days were written” means all states of life. (That each and all things that man has thought, willed, spoken, and done, even all that he has seen and heard, are with him in his spirit as if written therein, so that nothing whatever is wanting, see in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 462, 463; and Arcana Coelestia, n.2469–2494, 7398; and that this is man’s “book of life,”—see n. 2474, 9386, 9841, 10505; and likewise, n. 5212, 8067, 9334, 9723, 9841. 200. And I will confess his name before My father and before His angels, signifies that they will be in Divine good and in Divine truth therefrom. This is evident from the signification of “I will confess his name,” as being that things are to be in agreement with the quality of their state of life; for “I will confess,” when said by the Lord, means to grant that things may be; for what the Lord says or confesses respecting a man or angel who is in the good of love and faith, He grants and provides, since all the good of love and of faith is from Him. Therefore in the Word, “to speak,” when predicated of the Lord, signifies to instruct, to illustrate, and to provide (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 5361, 6946, 6951, 7019, 8095, 10234, 10290).

The “Father” therefore is mentioned, that the Lord’s Divine good may be perceived by the angels who are in the spiritual sense of the Word; and “Son of God” and “Son of man” are mentioned, that the Divine truth may be perceived (as can be seen from what has been shown in the Arcana Coelestia, namely, that “Father” in the Word signifies good, n. 3703, 5902, 6050, 7833, 7834; that “father” signifies the church in respect to good, thus the good of the church, and “mother” the church in respect to truth, thus the truth of the church, n. 2691, 2717, 3703, 5581, 8897.

Here the Lord calls His glory “the glory of the Father and of the angels,” for He says, “in His glory and that of the Father and of the holy angels;” but in another place, “in the glory of the Father with the angels;” and elsewhere, “in His glory with the angels.” As in Mark: When He shall come in the glory of His Father with the holy angels (8:38).

But on the other hand, if it is assumed and acknowledged as a doctrine that the Divine of the Father is another Divine than the Lord’s, nothing will be seen in light in the Word; since the man who is in that doctrine turns himself from one Divine to the other, and away from the Divine of the Lord which he can see (which is done by thought and faith), to a Divine that he cannot see; for the Lord says: Ye have neither heard the Father’s voice at any time, nor seen His form (John 5:37; also 1:18); and to believe in a Divine and love a Divine that cannot he thought of under any form is impossible."

The “new temple” and “new earth,” here mean a new church, and each measurement or each number signifies something pertaining to the church.

This is evident from the signification of “He that is Holy, He that is True,” as being, in reference to the Lord, He from whom are charity and faith. He is called “holy” because charity is from Him, and “true” because faith is from Him. That the Lord is called “holy” because charity is from Him, and consequently that “holy” in the Word is predicated of charity and of faith therefrom will be seen presently. But the Lord is called “true” because faith is from Him, and consequently “true” in the Word is predicated of faith, for the reason that all truth is of faith; for that is called “true” which is believed; other things are not of faith because they are not believed. But because the faith of charity is here treated of, something shall first be said about faith and what it is. [2] There is spiritual faith, and there is faith merely natural. Spiritual faith is wholly from charity, and in its essence is charity. Charity, or love towards the neighbor, is to love truth, sincerity, and what is just, and to do them from willing them. For the neighbor in the spiritual sense is not every man, but it is that which is with man; if this be truth, sincerity, and what is just, and the man is loved on account of these, then the neighbor is loved.

Everyone loves another, not for the sake of his person, but for the sake of what is with him; this is the ground of all friendship, all favor, and all honor. From this it follows, that to love men for the sake of what is true, sincere, and just in them is spiritual love; for what is true, sincere, and just are spiritual things, because they are out of heaven from the Lord. For no man thinks, wills, and does any good thing that is good in itself,-but it is all from the Lord; and what is true, sincere, and just are good things that are good in themselves when they are from the Lord. These things, then, are the neighbor in the spiritual sense; from which it is clear what is meant in that sense by loving the neighbor, or by charity. From that is spiritual faith; for whatever is loved is called truth when it is thought. Everyone can see that this is so if he will reflect upon it, for everyone confirms that which he loves by many things in the thought, and all things by which he confirms himself he calls truths; no one has truth from any other source. From this it follows, that the truths a man has are such as is the love with him; consequently, if the love with him is spiritual, the truths will also be spiritual, since the truths act as one with his love. All truths, because they are believed, are called in one complex, faith. From this it is clear that spiritual faith in its essence is charity. So far concerning spiritual faith. [3] But faith merely natural is not a faith of the church, although it is called faith, but is merely knowing (scientia). It is not a faith of the church, because it does not proceed from love to the neighbor, or charity, which is the spiritual itself from which faith comes, but proceeds from some natural love that has reference either to love of self or to love of the world, and whatever proceeds from these loves is natural. Love forms the spirit of man; for man in respect to his spirit is wholly as his love is; from that he thinks, from that he wills, and from that acts; therefore he makes no other truth to be of his faith than that which is of his love; and truth that is of the love of self or the world is merely natural, because it comes from man and from the world, and not from the Lord and from heaven; for such a man loves truth, not from a love of truth but from a love of honor, of gain and of fame, which he serves; and as his truth is such, his faith also is such.

And again because nothing of this is in man’s spirit but only in his memory, together with other things of this world, therefore also after death it is dissipated. For only that which is of man’s love remains with him after death, for (as has been said) it is love that forms man’s spirit, and man in respect to his spirit is wholly such as his love is. (Other things respecting charity and faith therefrom may be seen in the Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, where charity and Faith are treated of, n. 84–106, 108–122; also in the small work on the Last Judgment, where it is shown that there is no faith where there is not charity, n. 33–39.) [4] That “holy” in the Word is predicated of Divine truth, and therefore of charity and its faith, is evident from the passages where it is spoken of. There are two things that proceed from the Lord and are received by angels, Divine good and Divine truth. These two proceed united from the Lord, but they are received by angels variously; some receive Divine good more that Divine truth, and some receive Divine truth more than Divine good. Those who receive Divine good more than Divine truth constitute the Lord’s celestial kingdom and are called celestial angels, and in the Word are called “the righteous” [or “just”]; but those who receive Divine truth more than Divine good constitute the Lord’s spiritual kingdom, and are called spiritual angels, and in the Word “holy” [or “saints”]. (Of these two kingdoms and their angels, see in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 20–28.) From this it is that “the righteous” or “just”] and “righteousness” [or “justice”] in the Word mean the Divine good and what proceeds therefrom, and that “the holy” and “holiness” mean Divine truth and what proceeds therefrom. From this can be seen what is meant in the Word by “being justified” [or “made righteous”], and “being made holy.” As in Revelation: He that is righteous let him be made righteous still, and he that is holy let him be made holy still (22:11).

[5] Since Divine truth proceeding from the Lord is meant by “holy,” therefore the Lord is called in the Word “the Holy One,” “ the Holy One of God,” “the Holy One of Israel,” “the Holy One of Jacob;” and it is also from this that angels are called “holy,” and also the prophets and apostles; and it is from this that Jerusalem is called “holy.” That the Lord is called “the Holy One,” “the Holy One of God,” “the Holy One of Israel,” and “the Holy One of Jacob,” may be seen in Isa. 29:23; 31:1; 40:25; 41:14, 16; 43:3; 49:7; Dan. 4:13; 9:24; Mark 1:24; Luke 4:34. He is also called “King of the holy ones” [of saints] in Revelation: Righteous [or just] and true are Thy ways, Thou King of saints (15:3). The Lord is called “the Holy One,” “the Holy One of God,” “the Holy One of Israel,” and “the Holy One of Jacob” because He alone, and no one else, is holy, which is also declared in Revelation: Who shall not fear Thee, O Lord and glorify Thy name? for Thou only art holy (15:4). [6] Angels, prophets, and apostles are called “holy” because by them, in the spiritual sense, is meant Divine truth; and Jerusalem is called “the holy city,” because by that city, in the spiritual sense, is meant the church in respect to the doctrine of truth. That angels in the Word are called “holy,” see Matt. 25:31; Mark 8:38; Luke 9:26; the prophets, Mark 6:20; Luke 1:70; Rev. 18:20; the apostles, Rev. 18:20 that Jerusalem is called “the holy city,” Isa. 48:2; 66:20, 22; Dan. 9:24; Matt. 27:53; Rev. 21:2, 10. (That by “angels” in the Word Divine truth proceeding from the Lord is meant, see above, n. 130, 200; the like by “prophets,” see Arcana Coelestia, n. 2534, 7269; likewise by “apostles,” see above, n. 100; that by “Jerusalem” in the Word the church in respect to the doctrine of truth is meant, see the Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, n. 6.) From this it can be seen why it is that Divine truth proceeding from the Lord is called “the Spirit of truth,” and “the Holy “ spirit (see above, n. 183b), so also why heaven is called the habitation of holiness” (Isa. 63:15;"

[7] That “holiness” is predicated of Divine truth is evident from the following passages. In John: Jesus when praying said, Father, sanctify them [make them Holy] in Thy truth, Thy Word is truth, and for their sakes I sanctify Myself, that they also may be sanctified in the truth (17:17, 19). Here “being made holy” is plainly said in respect to truth, and “those made holy” in respect to those who receive Divine truth from the Lord. In Moses: Jehovah came from Sinai, out of the myriads of holiness; from His right hand the fire of the law unto them; even He who loveth the peoples; in Thy hand are all His saints, and they are prostrated at Thy foot; he shall receive of Thy words (Deut. 33:2, 3). “Sinai” signifies heaven there the Lord is, from whom is Divine truth, or from whom is the “law,” both in a strict and in a broad sense; “myriads of holiness” signifies Divine truths; “the law” signifies, in a strict sense, the ten commandments of the Decalogue, and in a broad sense, the whole Word, which is Divine truth; those are called “peoples” in the Word who are in truths, and those of them that are in truths are called “saints” “Being prostrated at Thy foot,” and “receiving of Thy words,” is the holy reception of Divine truth in ultimates, which is the Word in the sense of the letter, and being instructed therefrom. From this it can be known what the particulars in that prophecy signify in the spiritual sense. (That “Sinai” in the Word signifies heaven where the Lord is, from whom is Divine truth, or from whom is the law, both in a strict and a broad sense, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 8399, 8753, 8793, 8805, 9420.

From this it is clear that “myriads of holiness” are Divine truths, and that those here called “holy [saints]” are those who are in Divine truths. [8] In Moses: Speak unto all the congregation of the sons of Israel, and say unto them, Ye shall be holy, for I Jehovah of Israel am holy (Lev. 19:2). This chapter treats of the statutes, judgments, and precepts which they were to keep; and as these signify Divine truths, it is said that those who keep them “shall be holy.” Moreover, “Israel” signifies the spiritual church, which is the church that is in Divine truths, therefore it is said, “I Jehovah of Israel am holy.” In the same: Ye shall sanctify yourselves, and ye shall be holy. And ye shall keep My statutes that ye may do them (Lev. 20:7, 8). Here also the statutes, judgments, and precepts which are to be kept are treated of. If they have kept thy statutes and judgments, they shall be a holy people unto Jehovah (Deut. 26:16–19). In David : We shall be satisfied with the goodness of Thy house, with the holiness of Thy temple (Ps. 65:4). It is said “to be satisfied with the goodness of Jehovah’s house and with the holiness of His temple,” because the “house of God” in the highest sense signifies the Lord in respect to Divine good, and “temple” in respect to Divine truth (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 3720). In Zechariah: In that day there shall be upon the bells of the horses, Holiness unto Jehovah (14:20). The establishment of a new church is here treated of, and “bells” signify knowledges (scientifica) which are from the intellectual. (That “bells” signify such truths, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 9921,"

[10] That the word “holy” is predicated of charity can be seen from what was said above respecting the angels of heaven, namely, that there are some who receive Divine good more than Divine truth, and some who receive Divine truth more than Divine good; the former constitute the Lord’s celestial kingdom, and are those who are in love to the Lord, and because they are in love to the Lord are called “righteous” [or “just”]; but the latter constitute the Lord’s spiritual kingdom, and are those who are in charity towards the neighbor, and because these are in charity towards the neighbor, they are called “holy [or saints].” (That there are two loves that make heaven, namely, love to the Lord, and love towards the neighbor or charity, and that the heavens are thereby distinguished into two kingdoms, namely, a celestial kingdom and a spiritual kingdom, see in the work on Heaven and Hell. n 13–19; 20–28.)"

This is evident from the signification of “key,” as being the power of opening and shutting, here heaven and hell, for it follows, “He that openeth and no one shutteth, and shutteth and no one openeth;” therefore “key” means here the power of saving (as above, n. 86), since to open heaven and to shut hell is to save. It is evident also from the representation of “David,” as being the Lord in respect to Divine truth. By “David” in the Word the Lord is meant, because by “kings” in the Word the Lord in respect to Divine truth is represented, and by “priests” there the Lord in respect to Divine good. The Lord is represented especially by king David, because David had much care of the matters of the church, and also wrote the Psalms. (That “kings” in the Word signify Divine truth, and “priests” Divine good, see above, n. 31; moreover, that all names of persons and places in the Word signify spiritual things, which are the things pertaining to the church and to heaven, see above, n. 19, 50, 102a.) It is said, “He that hath the key of David,” because David (as was just said) represented the Lord in respect to Divine truth, and the Lord has all power in the heavens and on earth from Divine good through Divine truth; for in general good without truth has no power, neither has truth without good any power, for good acts through truth. From this it is that Divine good and Divine truth proceed united from the Lord, and so far as they are conjointly received by the angels, so far the angels are powers. This then, is why it is said “the key of David.” (That all power is in truths from good, see in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 228–233, where the Power of the Angels of Heaven is treated of; also n. 539.) [2] That by “David” in the Word the Lord is meant is clearly evident from certain passages where he is mentioned in the prophets. As in Ezekiel: They shall be to Me for a people,and I will be to them for a God, and My servant David king over them, that they may all have one shepherd. They shall dwell upon the land, they and their sons and their son’s sons even to eternity; and David My servant shall be prince to them to eternity (37:23–25)."

(That “Jehovah” in the Word means the Lord in respect to Divine good, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 732, 2586, 2807, 2822, 3921, 4253, 4402, 7010, 9167, 9315.) [3] In Zechariah: Jehovah shall save the tents of Judah first, that the glory of the house of David, and the glory of the inhabitant of Jerusalem, may not exalt itself above Judah. In that day shall Jehovah defend the inhabitant of Jerusalem, and the house of David shall be as God, and as the angel of Jehovah before them. And I will pour upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitant of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace. In that day there shall be a fountain open to the house of David, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem (12:7, 8, 10; 13:1). Here the Lord’s coming is treated of, and the salvation at that time of those who are of His spiritual kingdom. “Tents of Judah” mean the celestial kingdom; and the “house of David and the inhabitant of Jerusalem,” the spiritual kingdom. The spiritual kingdom is constituted of those in heaven and on earth who are in Divine truth, and the celestial kingdom of those who are in Divine good (see just above, n. 204b). From this it can be seen what these words mean, namely, that these two kingdoms shall act as one, and that one shall not exalt itself above the other. (Of these two kingdoms, see in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 20–28). That “Judah” signifies the Lord in respect to celestial love and the Lord’s celestial kingdom may be seen above (n. 119). And that “Jerusalem” signifies the Lord’s spiritual kingdom, see in the Arcana Coelestia (n. 402,3654, 9166).

[4] “David” and his “house” have a like signification also in the following passages. In Isaiah: Incline your ear, and come unto Me; bear, and your soul shall live; and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David. Behold I have given Him as a witness to the peoples, a prince and a lawgiver to the nations (55:3, 4). These things are said of the Lord, who is here “David.” In David: In the heavens Thou shalt establish Thy truth; I have made a covenant with My chosen; I have sworn to David My servant, even to eternity will I establish thy seed, and will build up thy throne to generation and generation; and the heavens shall confess Thy wonder, O Jehovah; Thy truth also in the congregation of the saints (Ps. 89:2–5). These things also were said of the Lord, and not of David; for it is said, “I have sworn to David My servant, even to eternity will I establish thy seed, and will build up thy throne to generation and generation;” this is not applicable to David, whose seed and throne were not established to eternity, and yet Jehovah swore, and an oath from Jehovah is irrevocable confirmation from the Divine (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 2842). The “seed of David” in the spiritual sense, means those who are in the truths from good from the Lord, and in an abstract sense, truths themselves that are from good (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 3373,3380, 10249, 10445); and “throne” means the Lord’s spiritual kingdom (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 5313, 5922, 6397, 8625). David is called “My servant” (as also above in Ezekiel 37:23–25), because “servant” in the Word is used of every person and every thing that serves and ministers (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 3441, 7143, 8241), and Divine truth proceeding serves and ministers to Divine good from which it proceeds.

His seed shall be to eternity, and his throne as the sun before Me. It shall be established as the moon to eternity, a faithful witness in the clouds (Ps. 89:34-37). That these things are said of the Lord is evident in the whole Psalm, for it treats of His coming, and afterwards of the repudiation of Him by the Jewish nation. That the Lord is here treated of, and that He is here meant by “David” is plain from these words in the same Psalm: I have found David, My servant; with the oil of My holiness have I anointed him. I will set his hand also in the sea, and his right hand in the rivers. He shall call Me, Thou art my Father, my God, and the rock of my salvation. I also will make him the firstborn, high above the kings of the earth. I will set his throne as the days of the heavens (verses 20, 25–27, 29). The Lord is meant also by “David,” by “the anointed,” and by “king,” in other passages in the Psalms, as can be clearly seen by those who understand the Word spiritually, but obscurely by those who understand it only naturally. As in these words in David: Thy priests shall be clothed with righteousness, and Thy saints shall shout for joy for Thy servant David’s sake turn not away the face of Thine anointed. There will I make the horn of David to bud: I will set in order a lamp for Mine anointed; upon himself shall his crown flourish (Ps. 132:9, 10, 17, 18). Here also the Lord is meant by “David” and by “the anointed;” for the Lord is treated of in this Psalm, as is clear from what goes before, where it is said:"

[6] That David might represent the Lord in respect to Divine truth, the Lord was willing to be born of the house of David, and also to be called “the Son of David,” “his Root and Offspring,” also “the Root of Jesse.” But when the Lord put off the human from the mother, and put on the Human from the Father, which is the Divine Human, He was no longer David’s son. This is meant by the Lord’s words to the Pharisees: Jesus said to the Pharisees, How does it seem to you respecting Christ? whose Son is He? They said unto Him, David’s. He said unto them, How then doth David in spirit call Him Lord, saying, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou at My right hand, until I place thine enemies as a stool of thy feet? If David then calleth Him Lord, how is He his Son (Matt. 22:42–45; Luke 20:41–44). That the Lord glorified His Human, that is, put off the human from the mother, and put on a Human from the Father, which is the Divine Human, see in the Doctrine of the New Jerusalem (n. 293-295, 298–310). For this reason He was not David’s son, as He was not the son of Mary, whom therefore He did not call His mother, but “woman” (Matt. 12:46–49; Mark. 3:31 to the end; Luke 8:19–21; John 2:4; 19:25, 26). The like is meant by “the key of Peter,” as by “the key of David,” namely, that the Lord has all power, and that He has this power through His Divine truth, as will be seen in the article that now follows. 206. He that openeth and no one shutteth, and shutteth and no one openeth, signifies power to admit into heaven all who are in the faith of charity, and to remove from heaven all who are not. This is evident front the signification of “that openeth and no one shutteth,” as being, in reference to the Lord, to admit into heaven (of which presently); and from the signification of “and shutteth and no one openeth,” as being to remove from heaven. The former means to admit into heaven, and the latter to remove from heaven, because the Lord alone opens heaven to those who are admitted."

      "text": "APOCALYPSE EXPLAINED 388 This no man, spirit, or angel can do from himself. How this is shall be explained in a few words. When a man after death is in such a state that he can be admitted into heaven there appears to him a way that leads to the heavenly society in which he is to be; until he is in this state the way thither does not appear to him; this way is opened to him by the Lord only. Such is each one’s introduction and admission into heaven. The same is true of the evil man after death. When he is in the state for passing into hell, a way appears to him that leads to the infernal society in which he is to be; until he is in this state the way thither does not appear to him. The reason of this is that ways in the spiritual world appear to each one according to the intention of his thought, thus according to the affection of his love. When, therefore, a spirit has been brought into his reigning love (for everyone after death is brought into that love), then ways to the society where his love reigns appear From this it is clear that it is love itself that opens; and as all the love of good and truth is from the Lord, it follows that the Lord alone opens the ways for those who are admitted into heaven. On the other hand, as all the love of evil and of falsity is from the man or spirit only, it follows that the spirit himself opens for himself the way to hell. (These things may be seen more clearly in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 545–550, where it is shown that the Lord casts no one into hell, but that it is the spirit who casts himself thither. That ways in the spiritual world appear to everyone according to the intention of his thought, thus according to the affection of his love, see in the same work, n. 479,590.) [2] As regards the hells, they are all shut, and can in no wise be opened except by the Lord’s permission; they are shut because of the evils and falsities that are continually striving to break out from them and do harm to those who are in goods and truths from the Lord (about which see also in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 584–592). From this then it is clear how it is and thence how it is to be understood that, “He that hath the key of David openeth and no one shutteth, and shutteth and no one openeth.” Heaven is opened to those who are in the faith of charity, and is shut to those who are not, for those who are in the faith of charity are here treated of (see above, n. 203), and those who are in the faith of charity are in Divine truth from the Lord, and Divine truth from"

And unto thee will I give the keys of the kingdom of the heavens, and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in the heavens; and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in the heavens (16:18, 19). “Peter” here, in like manner as “David,” signifies in the highest sense, Divine truth proceeding from the Lord’s Divine good, and in the internal sense, every truth from good that is from the Lord. The “rock” (petra) that is spoken of in the Word where Peter is mentioned, and from which Peter’s name is derived, has a like signification. The Lord’s twelve disciples represented all the truths and goods of the church in the complex; Peter represented truth or faith, James charity, and John the works of charity. But here Peter represented faith from charity, or truth from good which is from the Lord, because Peter here acknowledged the Lord in heart, saying: Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God. And Jesus answering, said, Blessed art thou, Simon Bar Jonah; for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but My Father, who is in the heavens. I say unto thee, Thou art Peter, etc. (verses 16–18, and the following). (This may be seen illustrated in the small work on the Last Judgment, n. 57.) [4] There is a like meaning in the Lord’s words to the rest of the disciples, in Matthew: Jesus said to His disciples, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven (18:18)."

It is indeed plain from the common use of language, that “to give an opened door” signifies to admit into heaven; and still this is from correspondence; for a house and all things pertaining to a house correspond to the interiors of man which are of his mind, and from that correspondence they also signify in the Word the things of the mind. That this is so can be seen from representatives and appearances in heaven, where there are palaces, houses, rooms, bed-chambers, hallways, courts, and within them a variety of things for uses; these things the angels have from correspondence; and for this reason the wiser angels have palaces more magnificent than the less wise have (but respecting these, see in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 183–190, where The Habitations of the angels of Heaven are treated of); and as palaces, houses, and all things pertaining to a house have a correspondence, so evidently do doorways, doors, and gates, which correspond to entrance and admission; and when the doorway appears open, it is a sign that there is opportunity to enter, and when it is closed, that there is no opportunity. [2] Moreover, when newly arrived spirits are introduced into a heavenly society, the way that leads to it is opened to them by the Lord; and when they come thither there appears a gate with a door at the side, where there are guards who admit them, and afterwards there are others who receive and introduce them. From this it can now be seen what “doorways,” “doors,” and “gates,” signify in the Word, namely, admission into heaven; and as the church is the Lord’s heaven on earth, they also signify admission into the church; and as heaven or the church is within man, “doorways,” “doors,” and “gates” signify approach and entrance, with man (of which presently). And because all things that signify heaven and the church signify also the things of heaven and the church, and here the things that introduce, which are truths out of good from the Lord, and because these truths are from the Lord, and are therefore His, yea, are Himself in them, therefore “doorway,” “door,” and “gate” to heaven and the church, mean in the highest sense the Lord.

But he that entereth in through the door is the shepherd of the sheep; to him the porter openeth. I am the door of the sheep, through Me if anyone enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and go out, and find pasture (10:1–3, 7, 9). Here “to enter in through the door” is evidently to enter in through the Lord, for it is said, “I am the door of the sheep.” To enter in through the Lord is to approach Him, acknowledge Him, believe in Him, and love Him, as He teaches in many passages; thus is man admitted into heaven, and in no other way; consequently the Lord says, “Through Me if anyone enter in, he shall be saved;” also “he that climbeth up another way, the same is a thief and a robber.” [3] Therefore he that approaches the Lord, acknowledges Him, and believes in Him, is said to open the door to the Lord, that he may enter in. In Revelation: Behold I stand at the door and knock; if any man hear My voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with Me (3:20). What this means will be told in what follows where this part of the chapter will be explained. Here something shall merely be said about doors or gates, in respect to man, since it is said, “I stand at the door and knock.” To man’s rational two ways lead, one from heaven, the other from the world. By the way from heaven good is introduced, by the way from the world truth is introduced. So far as the way from heaven is opened with man. So far he is affected by truth and becomes rational, that is, sees truth from the light of truth. But if the way from heaven is shut, man does not become rational; for he does not see truth, and yet it is truth from the light of truth that makes the rational; he can, indeed, reason about truth, and from reasoning or from memory can talk about it; but he is not able to see whether truth is truth. To think well about the Lord and about the neighbor opens the way from heaven; while to think not well about the Lord and to think evil about the neighbor shuts that way. As there are two ways that lead into man, so there are two doorways or gates through which entrance is effected. Through the"

This means, in the sense of the letter, that they will admit those who are righteous and faithful into the cities; but in the internal sense, that they will admit them into the church; for “gates” signify admission; “a righteous nation” signifies those who are in good; “keeping faithfulness” signifies those who are in truths from good.

[2] It should be known that there are two principal things of the church, namely, the acknowledgment of the Lord’s Divine in His Human, and making the truths from the Word to be of one’s life; moreover, no one can he in the one of these unless he is at the same time in the other; for all truths that are made to be of the life are from the Lord, and this is done with those who acknowledge the Divine in His Human. For the Lord flows in with all, as well in the heavens as on the earth, from His Divine Human, and not from the Divine separately. Consequently those who in their thought separate the Divine of the Lord from His Human, and look to the Divine of the Father not as in the Human but as beside it or above it, thus separated from it, receive no influx from the Lord nor thus from heaven, for all who are in the heavens acknowledge the Lord’s Divine Human (see concerning this in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 2–19, 59–72, 78–86 seq., 212). From this it is clear that all truths that are made of the life are from the Lord with those who acknowledge the Divine in His Human, that is the Divine Human. Truths become of the life when man loves them, thus when he wills them and does them, for he who loves, wills and does; in a word, truths are made of the life when man from affection lives according to them. Such truths are from the Lord because the Lord flows into the love with man, and through the love into truths and thus makes them to be of the life. [3] Something shall now he said about the power that man has from the Lord against evils and falsities. All power that angels have and also that men have is from the Lord; and the measure in which they receive the Lord is the measure of their power. He who believes that any power against evils and falsities comes from what is man’s own (proprium) is greatly mistaken; for it is evil spirits, conjoined to the hells, that induce evils and falsities thence with men, and these spirits are numerous, and each one of them is conjoined to many hells, in each of which also there are many spirits, and no one except the Lord can turn these away from man,"

Those who are in celestial love have much power, hut those who are in spiritual love have some power; and because what is written to the angel of this church, treats of those who are in love towards the neighbor, or in charity and in faith therefrom, which love is spiritual love, it is said, “Thou hast some power.” [4] But it is to be noted, that all the power that angels and men have from the Lord is from the good of love; and since the good of love does not act from itself but through truths, therefore all power is from the good of love through truths, and with those who are spiritual, from the good of charity through the truths of faith. For good takes on a quality through truths, good without truths having no quality and where there is no quality there is neither force nor power. From this it is clear, that good has all power through truths, or charity through faith, and neither charity apart from faith nor faith apart from charity has any power. This is meant also by the keys given to Peter, for “Peter” there means, in the spiritual sense, truth from good which is from the Lord, thus faith from charity; and the “keys” given to him the power over evil and falsities. These things were said to Peter when he acknowledged the Divine of the Lord in His Human; which means, that those have power who acknowledge the Divine of the Lord in His Human, and from Him are in the good of charity, and in the truths of faith. That these thing were said to Peter when he acknowledged the Lord is shown in Matthew: Jesus said to the disciples, Who say ye that I am? Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God. And Jesus answering said unto him, Blessed art thou Simon Bar-Jonah; for flesh and blood hath not revealed this unto thee, but My Father who is in the heavens. Out I also say unto thee, thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church; and the gates of the hells shall not prevail"

This is evident from the signification of “from the synagogue of Satan,” as being those who are in the doctrine of all falsities (see above, n. 190). Here therefore, “from the synagogue of Satan” means those who are in the doctrine of faith alone, and in no charity, since what is written to the angel of this church treats of those who are in faith from charity. These are said to be “from the synagogue of Satan” because they are not in faith, although they think they are; and because they reject charity as being no means to salvation, and yet the Lord flows into faith through charity, and not into faith separate from charity; for faith separate from charity is merely knowing (scientia) in which there is no life from the Divine. From this it is that they who are in the doctrine of faith alone, and not in charity, are in no illustration; they are therefore in the doctrine of many falsities, which is specially signified by “the synagogue of Satan.” (That there is no faith where there is no charity, see in the small work on the Last Judgment, n. 33–39; and what faith and what charity are, in the Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, n. 84 107 108–122.) That they are in the doctrine of many falsities will be seen in the following article. 211. Of those saying that they are Jew, and are not, but do lie, signifies who believe themselves to be in truths, when yet they are in falsities.

From this it is that “to say that they are Jews” signifies to believe themselves to be in genuine doctrine, thus in truths themselves. This is evident also from the signification of “to lie,” as meaning to be in falsities, for “a lie” signifies in the Word the falsity of doctrine (about which see Arcana Coelestia, 8908,9248). They who are in faith alone and in no charity, know not that they are in falsities, because they believe themselves to be in truths, when yet, out of the false principle, which is that faith alone saves, falsities flow in a continual series; for a principle draws all things to its own side, since they must be connected with it; and this is the cause of their great ignorance in regard to the things of heaven and the church. That they who are in faith alone are so ignorant is clear from this, that they do not know what celestial love is, which is love to the Lord; what spiritual love is, which is charity towards the neighbor; what the neighbor is, what good is, what the conjunction of good and truth is, what spiritual life is, what spiritual affection is, what conscience is, what freedom of choice is, what regeneration is, what spiritual temptation is, what baptism and the holy supper are, and why they are commanded, what the spiritual sense of the Word is, what heaven and hell are, and that both of them are from the human race; and as to many other things. From this their ignorance falsities flow whenever these subjects are thought about, since they are unable to think, as was said above, from any illustration or to have any internal sight respecting anything spiritual. (See, moreover, what is shown on this subject in Arcana Coelestia, that faith separate from charity is no faith, n. 654, 724, 1162, 1176, 2049, 2116, 234.q, 2349, 3849, 3868, 6348, 7039, 7822, 9780, 9783; that such faith perishes in the other life, n. 2228, 5820; that when faith alone is taken as the principle, truths are contaminated by a false principle n. 2435; that such persons will not suffer themselves to he persuaded, because it is against their principle, n. 2385; that the doctrinals of faith alone destroy charity, n. 6353, 8094; that they who separate faith from charity, are inwardly in the falsities of their own evil, although they are ignorant of it, n. 790, 7950; that therefore good cannot be conjoined to them, n. 8981,8993; that faith separate from love and charity is as the light of winter, in which all things of the earth become torpid, and there is no production of corn, fruits, and flowers; but that faith from"

Of such it is said in the Word that they will conte to the door and knock, but will not he admitted; “to come to the door and knock,” is “to worship at the feet;” it is said, “at thy feet,” because heaven in the whole complex resembles a man; the highest or third heaven answers to the head, the middle or second heaven to the body, and the lowest or first heaven to the feet; therefore, to stand at the feet and worship, is to be out of heaven and to wish to be admitted, but not to be able. (That heaven in one complex resemble a man, see Heaven and Hell, n. 59–67, seq.; that there are three heavens,n. 29–40; and that the highest heaven forms the head, the middle the body, and the lowest the feet, n. 65.)

[2] That such a lot awaits those who are in faith alone and in no charity, was foretold by the Lord in many passages. Thus in Matthew: Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire; therefore by their fruits ye shall know them. Not everyone that saith unto Me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but he that doeth the will of My Father who is in the heavens.

And everyone that heareth My words and doeth them not, shall be likened to a foolish man who built his house upon the sand (7:19–27). Here those who are in faith from charity, and those who are in faith and in no charity are described; those who are in faith from charity, by “the tree bearing good fruit,” and by “the house that was built upon a rock;” “fruits” moreover signify in the Word the works of charity and a “rock” faith from charity; but those who are in faith separate from charity are meant by “the tree that bringeth forth no good fruit,” and by those “building a house upon the sand,” “evil fruit” moreover signifies in the Word evil works, and “sand” faith separate from charity. Of such it is said that they will say, “Lord, Lord, open to us,” but that the reply will be, “I never knew you; depart from Me, all ye workers of iniquity.” [3] In like manner in Luke:"

But He shall say, I tell you, I know you not whence ye are; depart from Me, all ye workers of iniquity (13:24–27). Here again those are treated of who are in faith and not in charity of whom it is said that they “will stand without, knocking at the door,” but that they will not be admitted; “to eat and to drink before the Lord, and to be taught in the streets” signifies to listen to the Word and preachings from the Word, and to know the matters of faith; but as such are in no charity, it is said to them, “I know you not whence ye are, depart from Me;” for the Lord knows all from love and not from faith separate. [4] The same is meant by: The five foolish virgins, who had not oil in their lamps, concerning whom also it is said that they came, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us; but He answered, Verily I say unto you, I know you not (Matt. 25:1–12). “Virgins” signify in the Word those who are of the church; “lamps” the things that belong to faith, and “oil” the good of love; therefore by “the five foolish virgins, who had no oil in their lamps,” are signified they who are in faith and not in love. The like is signified also by: The goats on the left hand to whom it was said that He hungered and thirsted and they gave Him not to eat and to drink; that He was a stranger and they took Him not in; that He was naked and they clothed Him not; that He was sick and in prison and they visited Him not (Matt. 25:41–43); “the sheep at the right hand” here signify those who are in charity; “the goats” those who are in faith and in no charity.

This is evident from the signification of “to know.” as being knowledge; and from the signification of “to love,” as being, in reference to the Lord, that He is present. It means that He is present in charity, and not in faith apart from charity, because those are here treated of who are in the faith of charity (see above, n. 203); and the Lord is present in man’s affection or love, thus in the life of his spirit, for it is love or affection that makes the life of his spirit; consequently the Lord is present in charity, for charity is affection itself or man’s spiritual love; and as the Lord is present with man in charity, He is evidently not present in faith without charity; neither is faith without charity spiritual, consequently it is not inwardly in man, nor does’ it constitute his life, but it is outside of him, in the memory, and in something of natural thought therefrom. “To he loved,” in reference to the Lord, means that He is present, because love (dilectio seu amor) causes conjunction and consequent presence, and to him who loves, the Lord enters in, and teaches and leads him, and enables him also to love Hi,n, that is, to do His commandments and precepts, for this is to love the Lord. That with him whom He loves the Lord is present, and that he who keeps His commandments and precepts loves Him, He Himself teaches in John: He that hath My commandments, and doeth them, he it is that loveth Me; and he that loveth Me shall be loved of My Father, and I will love him, and We will come unto him, and make Our abode with him (14:21, 23). 214. Verse 10. And1 thou hast kept the word of My endurance, signifies that they have lived according to the Lord’s commandments. This is evident from the signification of “keeping the word” of the Lord, as being to live according to His commandments, for “word” is commandment, and to “keep” it is to live. It is said, “the word of My endurance,” because of steadfastness in it without being wearied. The term “endurance,” is occasionally used in Revelation, and when used it signifies what is applied to life (as also above, n. 98)."

This is evident from the signification of “the hour of temptation that is to come upon the whole world,” as being the time of the last judgment; and from the signification of “trying them that dwell upon the earth” as being visitation upon those who are in the former heaven; that those who are in faith from charity, who are here treated of, will then be saved, is meant by “I will keep thee.” These things evidently relate to the last judgment, for it is said, “the hour of temptation that is to come upon the whole world, when they shall he tried that dwell upon the earth.” But as the last judgment, also the former heaven and its abolition, and the new heaven and its formation, are treated of in the small works on The Lost Judgment and The New Jerusalem, and will he further treated of in this work, additional explanation of these words is deferred. 216. Verse 11. Behold, I come quickly, signifies that this is certain. This is evident from the signification of “quickly,” as being certainty and fullness (see above, n. 7). “Quickly” signifies certainty and fullness, because time and all things pertaining to time in the Word signify states; therefore “quickly” and “speedily” signify a present state of affection and of thought therefrom, consequently certainty and fullness. (That time and all things of time correspond to states, and therefore signify states, see in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 162–169; and that “quickly” signifies what is stirred up by affection, thus what is present and certain, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 7695, 7866.) 217. Hold what thou hast, signifies steadfastness in a state of faith from charity even unto the end, as is evident from what was said above (n. 173), where there are similar words. 218.

Verse 12. He that overcometh I will make him a pillar in the temple of My God, signifies that those who are steadfast will be in Divine truth in heaven. This is evident from the signification of “overcoming,” as being to be steadfast in the genuine affection of truth (see above n. 128); here in faith from charity, since that faith is treated of in what is written to the angel of this church (see above, n. 203); also from the signification of “pillar” as being Divine truth sustaining; also from the signification of “the temple of God” as being in the highest sense, the Lord’s Divine Human, and in the relative sense, the Lord’s spiritual kingdom, thus the heaven that constitutes that kingdom (of which presently). “A pillar in the temple” means Divine truth sustaining, because “temple” signifies heave”, and heaven is heaven from the Divine truth that proceeds from the Lord; for by heaven all angels are meant, because heaven is made up of angels, and front them is called heaven; and angels are angels in the measure in which they receive the Divine truth that proceeds from the Lord; and for this reason angels in the Word also signify Divine truths (see above, n. 130, 200). Now as heaven is Divine truth, and “temple” signifies heaven, it follows that all things of the temple signify such things as pertain to Divine truth, and that the “pillars” therein signify Divine truths sustaining. Divine truths sustaining are in general lower truths, because these sustain the higher; for there are lower and higher Divine truths, as there are lower and higher heavens. (There are degrees of these, on which see in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 38, 208, 209, 211.) The heavens that belong to a lower degree sustain those that belong to a higher degree; here, therefore, by the Lord’s making him that overcometh “a pillar in the temple” is meant that such will be in a lower heaven. They who are in the faith of charity are also in the lower heaven, which is called the spiritual heaven; while those who"

These things were said to the prophet, because all prophets signify the doctrines of Divine truth, and because the church in which Divine truths are falsified is here treated of it is therefore said, “Behold I have given thee this day for a fenced city, for a pillar of iron, and for walls of brass against the whole land;” “a fenced city” signifies the doctrine of truth; “a pillar of iron” truth sustaining it; “walls of brass” good defending, and “land” the church. It is said, also, “against the kings of Judah, against the princes, against the priests thereof, and against the people of the land;” and “the kings of Judah,” and “princes,” signify truths falsified; “priests,” goods adulterated, and “the people of the land,” falsities in general; of these it is said, that they will fight against truths themselves, but shall not prevail.

And he made two chapiters of molten brass, to set upon the tops of the pillars; seven chains for the one chapiter, and seven chains for the other chapiter. And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple; and he set up the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin: and he set up the left pillar and called the name thereof Boaz (1 Kings 7:15–21). Since “the temple” signified heaven (as will be shown presently), therefore all things of the temple signified such things as are of heaven, thus of Divine truth there; for, as said above, heaven is heaven from the Divine truth that proceeds from the Lord; therefore “the porch of the temple” signified the things pertaining to the ultimate heaven, and as this sustains the two higher heavens, those two pillars were placed in the porch. 220a. But it shall be told also what “temple” signifies in the Word. In the highest sense, “temple” signifies the Lord’s Divine Human, and in the relative sense, heaven; and as it signifies heaven, it also signifies the church, for the church is the Lord’s heaven on earth; and as “temple” signifies heaven and the church it also signifies Divine truth proceeding from the Lord, for the reason that this makes heaven and the church; for those who receive Divine truth in soul and heart, that is, in faith and love, are they who constitute heaven and the church. As such is the signification of “temple,” it is said, “the temple of My God;” “My God,” when said by the Lord, meaning heaven and Divine truth there, which also is the Lord in heaven. The Lord is above the heavens, and to those who are in the heavens He appears as a sun. From the Lord as a sun light and heat go forth. Light in heaven is in its essence Divine truth, and heat in heaven is in its essence Divine good; these two make heaven in general and in particular. Divine truth is what is meant by “My God;” therefore in the Word of the Old Testament the Lord is called both “Jehovah” and “God;” “Jehovah” where Divine good is treated of, and “God” where Divine truth is treated of; for the same reason also angels are called “gods,” and the word God in the Hebrew is used in the plural, Elohim. This shows why it is said, “the temple of My God.” (That the Lord is called"

That light in the heavens is in its essence Divine truth, and heat there is Divine good, both from the Lord, see in the same work n. 126–140, 275.) [2] That “temple” in the Word signifies the Lord’s Divine Human, and in the relative sense, heaven and the church, consequently also Divine truth, can be seen from the following passages. In John: The Jews asking, What sign showest Thou unto us, that Thou doest these things? Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up. Then said the Jews, In forty and six years was this temple built, and wilt Thou raise it up in three days? But He was speaking of the temple of His body (2:18–23). That “temple” signifies the Lord’s Divine Human is here openly declared; for “destroying the temple and raising it up after three days” means the Lord’s death, burial, and resurrection. [3] In Malachi: Behold, I send My messenger, and he shall prepare the way before Me; and the Lord shall suddenly come to His temple, and the Angel of the covenant whom ye seek (3:1). Here also “temple” means the Lord’s Divine Human; for the Lord’s coming is here treated of, therefore “coming to His temple” signifies to His Human."

(That “skirts” signify, in reference to the Lord, His Divine truth in ultimates, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 9917.)

In Matthew: Woe unto you, ye blind guides, who say, Whosoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple, he is a debtor. Ye fools and blind; for whether is greater, the gold or the temple that sanctifieth the gold? (23:16, 17). In John: Jesus said to them that sold in the temple, Take these hence; make not My Father’s house a house of merchandise. Then the disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of Thine house hath consumed me (2:16, 17). 220b. [7] Beside these, there are many other passages in the Word where “temple” is mentioned. That it may be known that “temple” means heaven and the church, as also Divine truth proceeding from the Lord, I will cite these passages here, lest the mind should cling to the idea that a mere temple is meant, and not something more holy; for the temple in Jerusalem was holy because it represented and thus signified what is holy. That “temple” signified heaven is evident from these passages. In David: I called upon Jehovah, and cried unto my God: He heard my voice from His temple (Ps. 18:6). A day in Thy courts is better than thousands. I have chosen to stand at the door in the house of my God, rather than to dwell in the tents of wickedness (Ps. 84:10). The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree; he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon. They that are planted in the house of Jehovah shall flourish in the courts of our God (Ps. 92:12, 13)."

In Isaiah: The house of our holiness and our splendor, where our fathers praised Thee, is burned up with fire (44:11). In Jeremiah: I have forsaken My house, I have abandoned Mine heritage (12:7). In Haggai: I will shake all nations, that the choice of all nations may come; and I will fill this house with glory. The silver is Mine, and the gold is Mine. The glory of this latter house shall be greater than that of the former (2:7–9). In Isaiah: He shall say to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be built; and to the temple, Thou shalt be founded (44:28).

They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone, and then came the writing on the wall (5:2-4, seq.). The “gold and silver vessels that were brought from the temple of Jerusalem” signified the goods and truths of the church; that they “drank wine from them and praised the gods of gold, of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone,” signifies the profanation of those goods and truths; and on account of this the writing appeared on the wall, and the king’ was changed from a man into a wild beast. [9] In Matthew: And the disciples came to show Jesus the building of the temple. Jesus said unto them, See ye all these things? there shall not be left here stone upon stone that shall not be thrown down (24:1, 2; Mark 13:1–5; Luke 21:5–7). That “there should not be left of the temple stone upon stone that should not be thrown down” signifies the total destruction and vastation of the church (”stone” signifying the truth of the church); and because this is what is meant, the successive vastation of the church is what is treated of in these chapters in the Evangelists. In Revelation: And the angel stood, saying, Rise and measure the temple of God and the altar, and them that worship therein (11:1). The “temple” here also signifies the church, and “measuring” signifies to explore its quality: The new temple and its measurements (Ezek. 40–47); have a like signification."

In Ezekiel: The glory of Jehovah mounted up from above the cherub over the threshold of the house; and the house was filled with the cloud; but the court was full of the brightness of the glory of Jehovah (10:4). “House” here means heaven and the church, and “cloud” and “glory” Divine truth. (That “cloud” is Divine truth, see above, n. 36; and “glory” the like, n. 33.) [11] In Micah: Many nations shall go, and say, Come and let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah, and to the house of our God; that He may instruct us of His ways, and that we may go in His paths; for from Zion shall go forth instruction, and the Word out of Jerusalem (4:2). “Mountain of Jehovah, and house of God,” signify the church, likewise “Zion” and “Jerusalem;” “to be instructed of His ways, and to go in His paths,” is to be instructed in Divine truths; it is therefore said, “From Zion shall go forth instruction,and the Word out of Jerusalem.” [12] In Isaiah: A voice of a tumult of Jehovah from the city, the voice of Jehovah out of the temple (66:6). “City” means the doctrine of truth; “temple” the church; and “the voice of Jehovah out of the temple” Divine truth. In Revelation: There came forth a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying (16:17). Here, likewise, “voice” means Divine truth.

The temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened; and there came out from the temple seven angels, having the seven plagues. And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from His power (15:5, 6, 8). Here seven angels are said to have come out from the temple in heaven, because “angels” signify Divine truths (see above, n. 130, 200). What is signified by “smoke from the glory of God” will be seen in the explanation of these words further on. It should be known, moreover, that the temple built by Sold mon, and also the house of the forest of Lebanon, and each particular thing pertaining to them (as described in 1 Kings 6, 7), signified spiritual and celestial things pertaining to the church and to heaven. 221. And he shall go out thence no more, signifies that they shall be in it to eternity. This is evident from the signification of “going in’ thence no more,” when it is said of heaven and the Divine truth there (which are signified by “the temple of God”), as being that they shall be steadfast in these to eternity. 222a. And I will write upon him the name of My God, signifies their quality in respect to Divine truth implanted in the life. This is evident from the signification of “writing upon one,” when spoken of the Lord, as being to implant in the life (of which presently); also from the signification of “Dame,” as being quality of state (see above, n. 148); and also from the signification of “God,” as being Divine truth proceeding from the Lord in heaven, thus the Lord in heaven (concerning which see above, n. 220a); for the Lord is above the heavens, appearing to those who are in heaven as a sun (see in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 116–125). The Divine proceeding therefrom, which is called Divine truth, and which makes heaven in general and in particular, is what is meant in the Word by “God;” from this it is that angels are called “gods,” and that “God,” in the Hebrew is Elohim, in the plural.

[2] “To write upon one” means to implant in the life, because to write is to commit to paper anything from the memory, thought, or mind, that is to be preserved; in the spiritual sense, therefore, it signifies that which is to endure in man’s life, inscribed on it and implanted in it. Thus the natural sense of this expression is turned into a spiritual sense; for it is natural to write upon paper and in a book, but it is spiritual to inscribe on the life, which is done when anything is implanted in the faith and love, since love and faith make man’s spiritual life. Because “to write” signifies to implant in the life, it is said of Jehovah or the Lord that “He writes,” and that “He has written in a book,” meaning that which is inscribed by the Lord on man’s spirit, that is, on his heart and soul, or what is the same, on his love and faith. Thus, in David: My bone was not hidden from Thee when I was made in secret; upon Thy book were written all the days when they were fashioned, and not one of them is wanting (Ps. 139:15, 16). Let them be blotted out of the book of lives, and not be written with the righteous (Ps. 69:28). In Daniel: The people shall be delivered, everyone that shall be found written in the book (12:1). In Moses: Blot me, I pray Thee, out of the book which Thou hast written. And Jehovah said, Whosoever hath sinned against Me will I blot out of My book (Exod. 32:32, 33). In Revelation:"

I saw that the books were opened: and another book was opened which is that of life; and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the book’, according to their works. And If anyone was not found written in the book of life, he was cast into the lake of fire (20:12, 13, 15). And there shall enter into the New Jerusalem only they that are written in the Lamb’s book of life (21:27). In these passages it is not meant that they are written in a book, but that all things of faith and love are inscribed on man’s spirit (as may be seen from the things shown in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 461–469). 222b. [3] That “to write,” in the Word, signifies to inscribe on and implant in the life, is clear from other passages where “writing” is mentioned. Thus in Jeremiah: I will give My law in the midst of them,and will write it on their heart (31:33). “To give the law in the midst of them” means Divine truths in them; “in the midst” signifies inwardly with man (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 1074, 2940, 2973); and “to write it on the heart” is to impress upon the love, for “heart” signifies love (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 7542, 9050, 10336). In Ezekiel: The prophet saw a roll of a book written front and back, and there were written thereon plaints, moaning, and woe (2:9, 10; 3:1–3). “The roll of a book written front and back” signifies the state of the church at that time, thus what the life was of those of the church; therefore “the roll of the book” means the same as “the book of life” mentioned above; and as their life was destitute of the goods of"

The like is signified by: Their writing the words of the law upon the twelve stones taken out of the Jordan (Deut. 27:2–4, 8; Josh. 4:3, seq.) [4] In Ezekiel: Son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon it, For Judah and for the sons of Israel, his fellows; and take another stick, and write upon it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and of all the house of Israel, his fellows; and then join them for thee one to another into one stick, that they both may be one in My1 hand (37:16, 17). What these things signify no one can know unless he knows what was represented by “Judah,” and what by “Joseph.” “Judah” represented the Lord’s celestial kingdom, and “Joseph” His spiritual kingdom; and “writing them upon two sticks” signifies each one’s state of love and of life therefrom. Their conjunction into one heaven is signified by “joining them one to another into one stick, that they both may be one in My hand.” The signification of these words is like that of the Lord’s words: Other sheep also I have, which are not of this fold; them also I must bring; and there shall be one flock and one shepherd (John 10:16). The writing was to be upon a stick, because a “stick” [wood)] signifies good, and it is good that conjoins.

They asked whether she should he stoned according to the law of Moses. Jesus stooped down, and with His finger wrote in the earth; and rising He said, He that is without sin among you let him first cast a stone at her; and again stooping down, He wrote in the earth. And when they heard these things, they went out one after another; and Jesus was left alone, and the woman; and He said to her, Woman, where are thine accusers; hath no man condemned thee? And He said, Go and sin no more (8:2–11). The Lord’s “writing in the earth” signifies the same as above in Jeremiah, “they that depart from Me shall he written in the earth,” namely, that they also were condemned on account of adulteries; therefore He said, “He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.” The Lord’s “writing twice in the earth” in the temple, signified their condemnation for adulteries in the spiritual sense; for the Scribes and Pharisees were those who adulterated the goods and falsified the truths of the Word, thus of the church; and “adulteries” in the spiritual sense are adulterations of good and falsifications of truth (see above, n. 141, 161); therefore that nation was also called by the Lord: An adulterous and sinful generation (Mark 8:38). 223a.

That “the city of My God” signifies the doctrine of Divine truth seems at first view remote, for the mind cannot readily think of doctrine when “city” is mentioned, or think of the church when a “land” is mentioned; yet in the Word, “ cities” (civitates aut urbes) mean nothing else in the spiritual sense; and for the reason that the idea of a city is merely natural, but the idea of doctrine in a city is spiritual. Angels, because they are spiritual, can have no other idea of a city than of the people therein in respect to doctrine, as they can have no other idea of a land than of the people therein in respect to their church or their religion. The reason of this is that the societies into which the heavens are divided are for the most part like cities [communities], all differing from one another in respect to the reception of Divine truth in good; when, therefore, a “city” is mentioned angels think of the doctrine of truth. (That the heavens are divided into societies according to the differences of the good of love and faith, see in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 41–50; and that their habitations are disposed into the form of cities, n. 184). 223b.

In Jeremiah: Behold I have given thee this day for a fenced city against the whole land (1:18). These things are said to the prophet, because “a prophet” in the Word signifies one who teaches truth, and in an abstract sense, the doctrine of truth; and as this is what “prophet” signifies, it is said to him, “I have given thee for a fenced city,” which signifies the doctrine of truth defending against falsities. (That “prophet” in the Word signifies one who teaches truth, and in the abstract sense, the doctrine of truth, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 2534, 7269.)

In Revelation: And the great city was broken into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell (16:18, 19).

He led them into a straight way, that they might go to a city of habitation (Ps. 107:2, 4, 5, 7). “To wander in the wilderness and in loneliness of way,” is to be in want of the knowledges of truth and good; “to find not a city of habitation” means not to find the doctrine of truth according to which they may live; “the hungry and thirsty” are those who have a longing to know good and truth; “to lead them into a straight way, that they might go to a city of habitation” is to lead them into genuine truth, and into the doctrine of life. In Isaiah: I said, Lord, how long? And He said, Until the cities shall be so devastated as to be without inhabitant, and the houses so that no man be In them, and the land be reduced to a waste (6:11).

Here also the devastation of the church is treated of; “the land which is said to be emptied, confounded, and profaned,” is the church; “city” is the truth of doctrine, “house” is its good; “wine, over which there is a cry in the streets,” is the truth of doctrine falsified, over which there is contest and indignation.

In the same: Behold, waters rising up out of the north, which shall become an overflowing brook, and shall overflow the land, the city and them that dwell therein (47:2). Vastation also is signified by “an overflowing brook.” In the same: If ye hallow the day of the sabbath, there shall enter in through the gates of this city kings and princes, riding in chariot and on horses, and this city shall be inhabited to eternity (17:24, 25). “Hallowing the sabbath” in the spiritual sense signifies holy acknowledgment of the Lord’s Divine Human and of His conjunction with heaven and the church; “kings and princes entering in through the gates of the city” signify the truths of the church; “their riding in a chariot and on horses” signifies that they shall be in the truths of doctrine and in intelligence; “the city,” which here is Jerusalem, is the church in respect to doctrine. Such is the spiritual sense of these words; such therefore is the sense in heaven. [9] In Zechariah: Thus said Jehovah; I will return to Zion, and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem; whence Jerusalem shall be called a city of truth. And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in the streets (8:3–5). Here “Zion” does not mean Zion, nor “Jerusalem” Jerusalem; but “Zion” means the celestial church, and “Jerusalem” that church in respect to the doctrine of truth; therefore it is called “a city of truth;” “the streets of the city” signify the truths of doctrine; “boys and girls playing in the streets” signify the affections of truth and good. (That “Zion” signifies the celestial church, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 2362, 9055; that “Jerusalem” signifies the church in respect to doctrine, n. 402, 3654,9166; and in the small work on The New Jerusalem, n. 6; that “streets” signify the truths of"

[10] Because “Zion” signifies the celestial church, and “Jerusalem” the church in respect to the doctrine of truth, Zion is called “the city of Jehovah,” and Jerusalem is called “the holy city,” “the city of God” and “the city of the great king.” As in Isaiah: They shall call thee, The city of Jehovah, the Zion of the Holy One of Israel (60:14). In Ezekiel: The prophet saw upon a high mountain the frame of a city on the south, and an angel measured the wall, the gate, the chambers, the porch of the gate; and the name of the city was Jehovah-is-there (40:1, seq.; 48:35). In Isaiah: Behold, Jehovah hath caused it to be heard, even to the end of the earth, Say ye to the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy salvation cometh. And thou shalt be called a city that is sought (62:11, 12). In David: As we have heard so have we seen in the city of Jehovah of hosts, In the city of our God; God will establish it for ever (Ps. 48:8). (What the celestial church is, and what the spiritual church, see in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 20–28.) These two cities are called “holy cities,” in Isaiah: Thy holy cities are become a wilderness, Zion is become a wilderness, Jerusalem a waste (64:10).

In Matthew: The devil took Jesus into the holy city (4:5). Coming forth out of the tombs, they entered into the holy city (27:63). [11] Jerusalem was called “the holy city” because it signified the church in respect to the doctrine of truth; and Divine truth proceeding from the Lord is what is called “holy” (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 6788, 8302, 9229, 9820, 10361). That city, apart from such representation and consequent signification, was not at all holy, but rather profane, is evident from the Lord’s having been rejected and crucified there; and for this reason it is also called “Sodom and Egypt” (Rev. 11:8). But because it signified the church in respect to the doctrine of truth, it was called not only “the holy city,” but also “the city of God,” and “the city of the great king.” Thus in David: There is a river, the streams whereof have made glad the city of God, the holy place of the tabernacle of the Most High. God is in the midst of her (Ps. 46:4, 5). Great is Jehovah in the city of our God, beautiful in situation the city of the great king (Ps. 48:1, 2). In Matthew: Swear not by the earth, for it is the footstool of God’s feet; neither by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great king (5:35). Jerusalem was called “the city of God” because “God” in the Word of the Old Testament means Divine truth proceeding from the Lord (as may be seen above, n. 220a, 222a); and it was called “the city of the great king,” because “king” also signifies, in reference to"

[12] In Isaiah: Thus saith Jehovah, thy Redeemer and Former from the womb, I make void the signs of liars; turning wise men backward, and making their knowledge foolish; saying to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be inhabited; and to the cities of Judah, Ye shall be built, and I will raise up the desolate places thereof (44:24–26). This treats of the rejection of the church whose doctrine is from self-intelligence, and of the establishment of a new church, whose doctrine is from the Lord. Doctrine from self-intelligence is meant by “I make void the signs of liars, turning wise men backward, and making their knowledge foolish,” and doctrine that is from the Lord by “saying to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be inhabited; and to the cities of Judah, Ye shall be built.” [13] In Jeremiah: Seest thou not what they do in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? I will cause to cease from the cities of Judah, and from the streets of Jerusalem, the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, for the land shall become a waste (7:17, 34). Here also “the cities of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem” signify the truths of doctrine; “the voice of joy and the voice of gladness” is delight from the affection of good and truth; “the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride” are those affections themselves; and that these are to cease is meant by “the land shall become a waste;” the “lad” is the church.

In that day there shall be an altar to Jehovah in the midst of Egypt (19:2, 18, 19). “Egypt” means the natural man and its knowledge; “that they may fight a man against his brother, and a man against his companion,” means against good and truth; “city against city, and kingdom against kingdom,” signifies doctrine against doctrine, and church against church; “in that day” signifies the Lord’s coming, and the state then of those who are natural and in true knowledges (scientificum); “five cities in the land of Egypt,that speak with the lip of Canaan” signify the truths of doctrine in abundance, which are genuine truths of the church, “five” meaning many or in abundance; “cities” truths of doctrine; “the lip of Canaan” genuine truths of the church. “An altar to Jehovah” here signifies worship from the good of love. [15] In the same: The highways have been laid waste, he that passeth through the way hath ceased; he hath rejected the cities, he regardeth not man. The land mourneth, it languisheth; Lebanon hath faded away (33:8, 9). “The highways that have been laid waste, and the way that is not passed through,” are truths leading to heaven, which are truths of the church; “to reject the cities” is to reject the truths of doctrine; “to regard not man” is to regard not truth and good. “The land that mourneth and languisheth” is the church in respect to good; “Lebanon that hath faded away” is the church in respect to truth. [16] In the same: Sing, O barren, that did not bear, for more are the sons of the desolate than the sons of the married one.

[17] In Jeremiah: I will bring upon them every good; they shall buy fields with silver, and this by writing in a book, in the cities of Judah, and in the cities of the mountain, and in the cities of the plain, and in the cities of the south (32:42, 44; 33:13).

Because that is what the words signify, “Ye are the light of the world,” therefore it is said, “A city that is set on a mountain cannot be hid. Neither can a lamp be lighted and be put wider a bushel;” for “a city set on a mountain” signifies the truth of doctrine from the good of love; and “a lamp” signifies in general truth from good and intelligence therefrom.

[20] In the same: Jesus sends forth the twelve disciples, saying to them, Go not off into the way of the nations, and enter not into a city of the Samaritans; go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel (10:5, 6). “The way of the nations” into which they were not to go off, signifies falsity from evil; “a city of the Samaritans” into which they were not to enter, signifies the false doctrine of those who reject the Lord; “the lost sheep of the house of Israel” signify those who are in the good of charity and in faith therefrom, “Israel” meaning all such wherever they may be. “A city of the Samaritans” signifies the false doctrine of those who reject the Lord, because the Samaritans did not receive Him (as may be seen in Luke 9:52–56). [21] In the same: Jesus said, When they persecute you in one city they should flee 1 into another (10:23). Here also by “city” is meant the doctrine of falsity from evil; that where this doctrine is the doctrine of truth will not be admitted, is meant by “when they persecute you in one city flee ye into another.” [22] In Luke: Then the master of the house being angry, said to his servants, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in hither the poor and maimed and blind and halt (14:21)."

The “poor,” “the maimed,” “the halt,” and “the blind,” signify those who are not in truths and goods, and yet long for them. (who are signified specifically by “the poor,” who by “the maimed,” “the halt,” and “the blind,” may be seen in the Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, n. 107, from the Arcana Coelestia.) [23] In the same: A certain nobleman going into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, gave to his servants ten pounds for trading; when be returned, he commanded the servants to be called. The first came, saying, Thy pound hath gained ten pounds. He said to him, good servant, because thou hast been faithful over the least, thou shalt have authority over ten cities. Then the second came, saying, Lord, thy pound hath made five pounds. He said to him, Be thou also over five cities (20:12–19, seq.). These words signify, in the spiritual sense, much more than can be expressed in a few words; let it be noted merely that by “cities” here are not meant cities but the doctrinals of truth and good; and by “having authority over them” intelligence and wisdom are meant; by “ten” much, and by “five” some. (That “ten” in the Word signifies much, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 1988, 3107, 4635, 9757; and that “five” signifies some, n. 4638, 9604.) from this it can now be seen that “the name of the city of My God, the New Jerusalem, which is coming down ont of heaven from Ky God,” signifies the doctrine of the new church, which is in the heavens. (This doctrine is also given in a separate small work, entitled The New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine.) 224. And My new name, signifies that they will also acknowledge the Lord’s Divine Human. This is evident from the signification of “I will write upon him My new name,” as being that they will acknowledge the Lord’s Divine Human. “To write upon one” is to implant in the life (see above, n. 222), here to implant in the faith that is from charity, because that faith is treated of in what is"

It is therefore also said at the end of The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem: That there is a trine in the Lord, namely, the Divine Itself, the Divine Human, and the proceeding Divine, is an arcanum from heaven, and is for those who will be in the holy Jerusalem (n. 297). It can be seen that this is “the Lord’s new name,” since this truth was not before acknowledged in the church. What besides this is meant in the Word by “the name of Jehovah,” “the name of the Lord,” and “the name of Jesus Christ,” can be seen above (n. 26, 102, 133, 148); and that the Lord’s Divine Human is meant (n. 26,102). This is meant by “the name of Jehovah,” because “name” in the Word signifies the quality of a state and of a thing (see above, n. 148), and the Divine quality by which all things were created and made in the heavens and on earth, is the Lord’s Divine Human, as is said in John: In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and God was the Word. All things were made through Him, and without Him was not anything made that was made. And the world was made through Him. And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only-begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth (1:1–3, 10, 14). From this it can be seen why “the name of Jehovah” means the Lord’s Divine Human. That this is meant in the Word by “the name of Jehovah” the Lord Himself shows in John: Jesus said, Father, glorify Thy name. And there came a voice out of heaven, saying, I have glorified it, and will glorify it again (12:25). To “glorify” is to make Divine. In the same:"

Verse 14. And to the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write, signifies those who are in faith alone, thus those who are in faith separate from charity. This is evident from the internal or spiritual sense of all things that are written to the angel of this church; for the essential of the church that is described in what is written to each of the churches, is made evident only from the internal sense; for these are prophecies; and all prophecies, like all things else in the Word, are written by correspondences, to the end that by means of these there may be conjunction of heaven with the church. Conjunction is effected by means of correspondences; for heaven, or the angels in heaven, understand spiritually all those things that man understands naturally, and between natural and spiritual things there is a perpetual correspondence, and by means of correspondences there is conjunction like that between soul and body. On this account the Word is written in the style that it is; otherwise there would be no soul within it, consequently no heaven within it; and if heaven were not in it, the Divine would not be in it. For this reason then it is said that from the internal or spiritual sense of all things in what is written to each church, it is made manifest what essential of the church is meant; thus that what is written to the angel of this church treats of those who are in faith alone, that is, in faith separate from charity. It is said faith separate from charity, by which is meant faith separate from the life, for charity is of the life; consequently when faith has been separated from the life, it is not in the man but outside of him; for whatever has place in the memory only, and is taken up from the memory into the thought, without entering into man’s will and from the will into act, that is not within man but outside of him; for the memory, and thought therefrom, is only as a court, through which there is entrance into the house; the house is the will. Such is faith alone, or faith separate from charity. Moreover, what this faith is may be seen in the Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, n. 108–122; also in the small work on the Last Judgment, n. 33–39; and in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 270, 271, 364, 482, 526.

These things saith the Amen, the faithful and the Witness, signifies from whom is every truth and everything of faith. This is evident from the signification of “amen,” as being verity or truth (of which presently); also from the signification of “the faithful and true Witness,” as being, in reference to the Lord, everything of faith from Him; “for witness,” in reference to the Lord signifies Divine truth which is from Him, and therefore everything of faith, for faith is of truth and truth is of faith. Divine truth proceeding from the Lord is called “a witness,” because it is His Divine in heaven and in the church in which He is, and which is Himself there; for this proceeds from His Divine Human and fills the whole heaven and forms and makes it; and from this it is that heaven in the whole complex resembles one man. Because Divine truth is from that source and is such, it is called “a witness;” for it bears witness respecting the Lord’s Divine Human, and makes it clear with all who receive the Divine truth from Him. From this it is that the angels of the higher heavens do not and cannot perceive any other Divine than the Lord’s Divine Human, and this from the influx of the whole heaven into their minds. From this it can be seen why, in reference to the Lord, “witness” signifies the Lord in respect to Divine truth in heaven and in the church; and why “to bear witness,” in reference to those who receive Divine truth from the Lord,signifies to acknowledge in heart the Lord’s Divine in His Human (see above, n. 27. That heaven as a whole and in every part resembles one man, and that this is from the Lord’s Divine Human, see in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 59–86, seq., 101; and that the Divine that proceeds from the Lord, which forms heaven, and forms angels into the image of heaven, is Divine truth, n. 13, 133, 138–140).

(That “to glorify,” in reference to the Lord means this, see the Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, n. 294.) [3] The like is signified by these words of the Lord: I tell you the truth; it is expedient that I go away; if I go, I will send the Comforter, the Spirit of truth, unto you (John 16:7, 8). From this it is clear that Divine truth is from the Lord’s Divine Human. The Lord calls Himself the “Amen,” because “amen” signifies verity, thus the Lord Himself, because when He was in the world He was Divine verity itself, or Divine truth itself. It was for this reason that He so often said “Amen,” and “amen, amen [verily, verily]” (as in Matt. 5:18, 26; 6:16; 10:23, 42; 17:20; 18:3, 13, 18; 24:2; 28:20; John 1:51; 3:11; 5:19, 24, 25; 6:26, 32, 47, 53; 8:34, 51, 58; 10:1, 7; 12:24; 13:16, 20, 21; 21:18, 25).

That “holy” in the Word is predicated of Divine truth, and “to be sanctified [made holy]” is predicated of those who receive Divine truth, see above (n. 204); therefore the Lord’s sanctifying Himself [making Himself holy], is making His Human to be Divine. (But on these things more may be seen shown in the Arcana Coelestia, in the quotations therefrom in the Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, n. 303–306.) Moreover, that “Amen” signifies Divine confirmation, see above (n. 34); as also in the Old Testament (Deut. 27:15–26; 1 Kings 1:36; Isa. 65:16; Jer. 11:5; 28:6; Ps. 41:13; 72:19; 89:52; 106:48). 229. The beginning of the working of God signifies faith from Him, which in appearance is the first thing of the church. This is evident from the signification of “beginning,” as being the first; and from the signification of “the working of God,” as being the church (of which presently). Faith is what is meant by “the beginning of the working of God,” for this is the subject treated of in what is written to the angel of this church; but that faith is “the beginning of the working of God,” that is, in appearance the first thing of the church, shall now be explained. By faith here is meant faith from the Lord, for faith not from the Lord is not the faith of the church; but faith from the Lord is the faith of charity. This faith is in appearance the first thing of the church, because it is the first to appear to the man of the church. But charity itself is actually the first thing of the church, because this is what makes the church with man. [2] There are two things that make the church, charity and faith. Charity is of affection, and faith is of thought therefrom. Affection is the very essence of thought, for apart from affection no one can think; everything of life that is in thought is from affection. From this it is clear that the first thing of the church is the affection that is of charity or love. But faith is called the first thing of the church because it is the first to appear; for what a man believes, that he"

This enjoyment, as it is spiritual and is above the sense of natural enjoyment, man does not perceive, except when he has become spiritual, that is, when he has been regenerated by the Lord. For this reason the things that are of faith, and thus of sight, are believed to be the first things of the church, although they are not first except in appearance. This therefore is called “the beginning of the working of God.” because the Word in the letter is according to appearance, since it is for the simple. But spiritual men, like the angels, are lifted above appearances, and perceive the Word as it is in its internal sense; consequently they perceive that charity is the first thing of the church, and that faith is there from; for as was said above, the faith that is not from charity and that is not of charity, is not faith (about which, see also in the small work on the Last Judgment, n. 33–39). [3] Even from ancient times, what the first thing of the church is, whether faith or charity, has been a disputed point; and those who have not known what charity is have declared that faith is the first things; but those who have known what charity is have declared that charity is the first thing, and that faith is charity in its manifestation, since the affection of charity made manifest to sight in thought, is faith; for when the delight of affection passes from the will into the thought it takes form, and presents itself to view in a variety of forms. This the simple have not apprehended, consequently they have taken that which appeared before the sight of their thought to be the first thing of the church; and because the Word in the letter is according to appearances, this therefore is there called “the first,” “the beginning,” and “the firstborn.” For the same reason, Peter, by whom the faith of the church was represented, was called the first of the apostles; when yet John was the first, because by “John” the good of charity was represented. That John, not Peter, was the first of the apostles, is clear from this, that it was John who leaned on the breast of the Lord, and that he, and not Peter, followed the Lord (John 21:20–22).

[4] For the same reason, by Reuben also, because he was the firstborn of the sons of Jacob, faith was represented, and it was believed that the tribe that had its name from him was the first; but yet that tribe was not the first, but the tribe of Levi, since by Levi the good of charity was represented; and for this reason the tribe of Levi was appointed to the priesthood, and the priesthood is the first of the church. (That the twelve sons of Jacob, or the twelve tribes named from them, represented all the truths and goods of the church, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 3858, 3926, 4060, 6335, 7836, 7891, 7996; that Reuben represented faith, n. 3861, 3866, 4605, 4731, 4734, 4761, 6342–6345; and that Levi represented the good of charity, n. 3875, 4497, 4502, 4503.) For the same reason in the first chapter of Genesis, where in the sense of the letter the creation of heaven and earth is treated of, but in the internal sense the new creation or regeneration of the man of the church at that time, it is said that light was first made, and afterwards the sun and the moon (see verses 3–5, 14–19); when yet the sun is first, and light is from it. Light was said to be the first of creation, because “light” signifies the truth of faith, and “the sun and moon” the good of love and of charity. (That by the creation of heaven and earth in the first chapter of Genesis, in the spiritual sense, the new creation of the man of the celestial church, or his regeneration, is meant and described, see the explanation of that chapter in the Arcana Coelestia, also n. 8891, 9942, 10545. That “light” signifies truth from good, thus also the truth of faith, see in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 126–140; and that “the sun” signifies the good of love, and “the moon” the good of charity, both from the Lord, in the same work, n. 116–125, 146.) From this it can now be seen what “the beginning of the working of God” signifies, namely, faith from the Lord, which in appearance is the first thing of the church. 230. Verse 15.

To each of the churches it is said first, “I know thy works,” and in every case “works” signify the things of the church there treated of (see above, n. 98); therefore what now follows describes what the life of faith alone is or the life of faith separate from charity. 231. That thou art neither cold nor hot, signifies that it is between heaven and hell, because it is without charity. This is evident from the signification of “cold,” as meaning to be not in spiritual love but in infernal love (of which presently); also from the signification of “hot,” as meaning to be in spiritual love (of which also presently). From this it is clear that “to be neither cold nor hot” signifies to be neither in infernal love nor in spiritual love, but between the two, and he who is between the two is between hell and heaven. [2] That those who are in faith alone, or in faith separate from charity, are in this state, has not been known; but it is evident that they are so, from the particulars of what is written to the angel of this church, and moreover from this, that those who are in faith separate from charity live for themselves, the world, and appetite, and those who so live are in infernal love; and yet these, by reading the Word, by hearing discourses therefrom, by receiving the Holy Supper, and by many things from the Word that they merely retain in the memory, look towards heaven; and when they do this, they are in some spiritual heat; but yet because this is not spiritual heat, or spiritual love, since they do not live according to the Word; consequently they are neither hot nor cold. Moreover, they thus draw the mind in two directions, for by the things that are from the Word they turn themselves towards heaven, and by the things that are of the life they turn themselves towards hell, thus they halt between the two. When such as these come into the other life, they are eager for heaven, saying, that they have had faith, have read the Word, heard sermons, often attended the Holy Supper, and by these things ought to be saved.

For this reason their spirit becomes such when freed from the ties of the earthly body; for it is the spirit of man that thinks and purposes. [3] These are meant by the Lord’s words in Matthew: Many will say to Me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied by Thy name, and by Thy name cast out demons, and in Thy name done many mighty works? And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you; depart from Me, ye that work iniquity (7:22, 23).

This is evident from the signification of “would that thou wert cold,” as being that it were better that there should be no faith (of which below); and from the signification of “or hot,” as being that there should be charity alone. What charity alone is, will be shown presently; first let it be shown what no faith is. Those who are in the doctrine of faith alone have, indeed, no faith, but this means no spiritual faith, or no faith of the church; yet they have a natural faith, which mag be called a persuasive faith. For they believe that the Word is divine, they believe in eternal life, in the remission of sins, and in many other things; but with those who are without charity, this belief is a persuasive faith which, regarded in itself, is not different from a belief in things not known, which are heard from others in the world and believed in, although neither seen nor understood, but because they were said by someone thought worthy of credit. This is not one’s own faith, but another’s faith within oneself; and such a faith, if not made our own by seeing and understanding, is not unlike the faith that one born blind and whose sense of touch is dull might have regarding colors and objects of sight in the world, of which he has an extraneous idea that no one knows but himself. This is what is called historical faith, and is not at all a spiritual faith, such as the faith of the church must be. Spiritual faith, or the faith of the church, is wholly from charity, so that in its essence it is charity; moreover, to those who are in charity, things spiritual that are believed appear in light. This I say from experience; for everyone who has lived in charity in the world sees in the other life his truths that he believes, while those who have been in faith alone, see nothing at all. [2] Yet still faith merely historical has a kind of conjunction with heaven through thought about God, heaven, and eternal life, but only through obscure thought, and not through the affection, which is of charity, for of this it has none. Such therefore, through the affection they have, which is the affection of the love of self and the world, are conjoined to hell. From this it can be seen that such are between heaven and hell, for they look with their eyes towards heaven, and with the heart towards hell. To do this is profanation, and the lot of profaners in the other life is the worst of all. To"

[3] It is for this reason then that it is said, “would that thou wert cold or hot;” for he who is cold, that is, without faith, does not profane; neither does he who is hot, that is, who has charity alone. That profanation is and the nature of it, see in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem n. 169, 172; and what and of what nature the persuasive faith is, n. 116–119; also, that there is no spiritual faith where there is no charity, in the small work on the Last Judgment, n. 33–39.) It shall now he told briefly what charity alone is. Charity regarded in itself is a spiritual affection, but charity alone is natural affection, and not spiritual; for charity itself, which is spiritual affection, is formed by truths from the Word, and so far as it is formed by these, so far it is spiritual. But charity alone, which is natural affection, is not formed by any truths from the Word, but exists with man from hearing discourses, without giving heed to truths or learning them; therefore charity alone is without faith, for faith is of truth, and truth is of faith. 233. Verse 16. So because thou art lukewarm, signifies those who live according to the doctrine of faith alone and of justification by faith. This is evident from the signification of “lukewarm,” as being those who are between heaven and hell, and thereby serve two masters. That those who think, believe, and live according to the doctrine of faith alone and justification by faith are such, has not yet been known; it shall therefore be made clear. With men of the church, there are two states of faith and of life therefrom, or of life and of faith therefrom; one is from doctrine, the other from the Word or from preachings from the Word. That there are these two, states hardly anyone knows; yet that there are these two and that with some they act as one, and with many others they do not act as one, has been granted me to see and know through living experience with spirits recently from the world, since these carry with them all the states of their life. But so long as men live in the world this cannot be seen and known, since what man’s spirit in itself thinks, believes, and loves, in spiritual things, cannot be"

The former is true of the learned, the latter of the simple. [2] What, therefore, the state of thought, faith, and life from doctrine is, shall first be said. The doctrine of the churches in the Christian world at this day declares that faith alone saves, and that the life of love is of no avail; also that when a man has received faith he is righteous, and that when he is thus justified nothing of evil can thenceforth be imputed to him; consequently, that any man is saved, even a wicked man, if he only has faith, or receives faith, though it be in the last hour of life. Those, therefore, who think and live from doctrine omit good works, because they believe that these do not affect a man, or contribute to his salvation. They are also unconcerned about evils of their thought and will, whether they be contempt of others in comparison with themselves, or enmities, hatreds, revenge, craft, deceits, and other like evils, because they believe that such evils are not imputed to those who have been justified by faith; saying in heart that they are not under the yoke of the law because the Lord fulfilled the law for them, nor under condemnation because the Lord took this upon Himself. From this then it is, that those who think, live, and believe according to the doctrine of faith alone and justification, do not look to God in their life, but only to self and the world; and those who in the course of their life look only to self and the world join themselves to the hells, for all who are in the hells make good and evil of no account. In a word, to live according to that doctrine is to confirm oneself in life that it is all the same to think, will, and do good, since this does not save, and also that it is the same to think, will, and so far as they have no fear of the law, do evil, since this does not damn, provided one has the confidence or trust, which is called saving faith (see in the Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, n. 115). These are evidently the “lukewarm” since they think, speak, and preach about God, the Lord, the Word, eternal life, whenever they are thinking, talking, or preaching from this doctrine, but give no thought to these subjects when they think or talk apart from doctrine.

[3] Something shall now be said about the state of faith and of life therefrom with men of the church, when it is from the Word. The greater part of those born within the churches where the doctrine of faith alone and of justification by faith is received, do not know what faith alone is, nor what is meant by justification; when, therefore, they hear those things preached, they think that a life according to the commandment of God in the word is meant, for they believe that this is faith and also justification, not entering more deeply into the mysteries of doctrine. And when these are taught about faith alone and justification by faith, they believe no otherwise, than that faith alone is to think about God and salvation, and how they ought to live; and that justification is to live before God. All within the church who are saved are kept by the Lord in this state of thought and faith, and after their departure from this world they are illustrated in truths, for they are capable of receiving instruction. But those who have lived according to the doctrine of faith alone and justification by faith (of whom above), become blind, for the reason that faith alone is no faith, and therefore justification by faith alone is a thing of nought. (That faith alone is no faith, see in the little work on the Last Judgment, n. 33–39.)

Again, What does it signify if I think and will evil, since this does not damn? Thus they relax all restraints to their thoughts and intentions, that is, to their spirit, for it is the spirit that thinks and intends, and doing is wholly in agreement herewith. But it should be known that there are very few who thus live according to doctrine, although it is believed by the preachers that all do so who listen to their preachings.

I am about to vomit thee out of My mouth, signifies separation from the knowledges from the Word. This is evident from the signification of “vomiting out,” when said by the Lord, as being separation; not that the Lord separates them from Himself, but they separate themselves from the Lord. It is said “to vomit out,” because the “lukewarm” are treated of, and in the world what is lukewarm produces vomiting. And this is also from correspondence; for the food that man takes corresponds to knowledges, and thence in the Word signifies knowledge,; therefore separation from knowledges means non-admission; but as those here treated of do admit something from the Word, it means ejection or vomiting. (That “food,” from correspondence, signifies knowledges and intelligence therefrom, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 3114, 4459, 4792, 5147, 5293, 5340, 5342, 5410, 5426, 5576, 5582, 5588, 5655, 8562; for the reason that knowledges nourish the internal man or spirit, as food nourishes the external man or body, n. 4459, 5293, 5576, 6277, 8418.) This is evident also from the signification of “out of My mouth,” as being, in reference to the Lord, out of the Word. “Out of the mouth” signifies, in reference to the Lord, out of the Word, because the Word is Divine truth, and this proceeds from the Lord, and what proceeds from the Lord and flows in with man is said to be “out of the mouth,” although it is not from the mouth, but is like light from the sun.

From this it can be seen that “I will vomit thee out of My mouth” signifies to separate from Divine truth, or what is the same, from the knowledges from the Word. [2] That those who are “lukewarm,” that is, “neither cold nor hot,” who are those that live according to the doctrine of faith alone and justification by faith (of which just above), are separated from the knowledges from the Word, is not known to themselves, for they believe that they are in knowledges more than others; but they are not, yea, they are in scarcely any knowledge; and this for the reason that the principles of their doctrine and religion are false, and from false principles nothing results but falsities; when therefore they read the Word, they keep their minds in their falsities, and as a consequence, either they do not see truths, or if they see them they pass them by or falsify them. These false principles are, that salvation is by faith alone, and that man is justified by faith. That they are separated from the knowledges from the Word and that they do not see truths therein, they may know if they will; for what is more frequently declared by the Lord, than that they ought to do His words, His commandments, His will, and that everyone shall be recompensed according to his deeds; also that the whole Word is based upon two commandments, which are to love God, and to love the neighbor; also that loving God is doing His commandments (John 14:21, 23, 24)? What men must do in order to be saved is said a thousand times in each Testament, also that hearing and knowing are nothing without doing. But do those who have confirmed themselves in faith alone and justification by faith, see these things? And if they see them do they not falsify them? Consequently they have no doctrine of life, but a doctrine of faith alone; when yet, life makes the man of the church, and those things come to be of his faith which are of his life.

Moreover, I have heard angels say that when they are permit ted to look into the church, and to see those who believe themselves to be intelligent from doctrine, that they see nothing but mere thick darkness, and those so believing are seen as if deep down under waters. [4] These are separated from the knowledges from the Word for two reasons; first, because they cannot be illustrated by the Lord, for the Lord flows into man’s good, and from that illustrates him in truths, that is, He flows into man’s love and therefrom into his faith; secondly, because they profane truths by falsifications, and those who do this are separated from truths themselves while they live in the world, that they may not know them, but in the other life they cast away from themselves all things they knew from the Word while in the world. Both these separations are meant by “being vomited out of the mouth.” Like things are meant by “vomiting” and “vomit” elsewhere in the Word; as in the following passages. In Isaiah: Jehovah hath mingled a spirit of perversities in the midst of Egypt; whence they have led Egypt astray in every work thereof, even as a drunkard goeth astray in his vomit (19:14). “Egypt” signifies the knowledge (scientia) of things, both spiritual and natural; “mingling the spirit of perversities in the midst thereof” signifies to pervert and falsify these things; “a drunkard” signifies those who are insane in spiritual things; and as truths mingled with falsities are cast out, it is said “as a drunkard goeth astray in his vomit.” (That “Egypt” signifies knowledge (scientia), see Arcana Coelestia, n. 1164, 1165, 1186, 1462, 5700, 5702,"

[5] In Jeremiah: Drink ye, and be drunken, and vomit and fall, and rise not because of the sword (25:27). “To drink and be drunken” is to drink in falsities and mix them with truths, and thence to be insane; “to vomit and fall” is altogether to cast out things falsified; “the sword,” because of which they shall not rise, signifies falsity destroying and laying waste truth (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 2799, 4499, 7102); which shows clearly what is meant by “vomiting and falling.” In the same: Make Moab drunken, for he hath magnified himself against Jehovah, that he may clap the hands in his vomit (48:26). “Moab” signifies those who adulterate the goods of the church, therefore “vomiting” is predicated of them. [6] In Habakkuk: Woe unto him that maketh his companion to drink even making him drunken, that thou mayest look upon their nakednesses. Thou shalt be satiated with disgrace instead of glory; drink thou also, and let thy foreskin be uncovered; the cup of Jehovah shall go about unto thee, and disgraceful vomiting shall be on thy glory (2:15, 16). “To drink even making him drunken” also signifies to drink in truths and mix them with falsities; the “nakednesses” upon which they look, signify the deprivation of truth and of intelligence therefrom (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 1073, 5433, 9960). The “foreskin that shall be uncovered” signifies the defilement of good (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 2056, 3412, 3413, 4462, 7225, 7245); “glory” signifies Divine truth, thus the Word (see Arcana Coelestia,n. 4809, 5922, 8267, 8427, 9429); which shows what is meant by “disgraceful vomiting upon their glory.”"

Whom shall he teach knowledge? (28:7–9). Here “wine” and “strong drink,” by which they err, signify truths mixed with falsities “priest” and “prophet” signify those who teach goods and truths, and in an abstract sense, the goods and truths of the church; “the seeing” among whom they err signify those who might be about to see truths; “to stumble in judgment” signifies insanity; “tables” signify all things that should nourish spiritual life, for tables mean the food that is on them, and “food” signifies all truths and goods, because these are what nourish spiritual life; therefore “tables full of the vomit of filthiness” signify the same things falsified and adulterated. [8] In Moses: Defile not yoursel ves with any of these thing; for in all these the nations are defiled which I cast out before you; whence the land is defiled; and the land hath vomited out her inhabitants; thus the land will not vomit you out, as it vomited out the nations that were before you (Lev. 18:24, 25, 28). Adulteries of every kind are here treated of, by which in the spiritual sense all kinds of adulterations of good and falsifications of truth or profanations are meant; and as it is not possible for evils and goods, nor for the falsities of evil and the truths of good to exist together without being cast out, therefore it is said that “the land,” that is, the church, “hath vomited them out.” From this it can be seen what is signified by “vomiting out.” 236a.

Moreover, “to say,” in the spiritual sense, signifies to think, because what is said goes forth from the thought, and thought is spiritual because it pertains to the spirit of man, while expression and speech from thought are natural because they pertain to the body. For this reason, “saying” has several significations in the Word. This is evident also from the signification of “being rich,” as being to possess the knowledges of truth and good, and to be intelligent and wise thereby (of which presently); also from the signification of “have gotten riches and have need of nothing,” as being to know all things so that nothing is lacking.

It was also shown that the things they knew are not truths but falsities, and that knowing and thinking falsities is not being intelligent and wise, for intelligence is of truth, and wisdom is of the life therefrom. And the reason of this was disclosed, namely that they were in no spiritual affection of truth, but only in a natural affection of knowing the things taught by their leaders, by some for the sake of their function, by others for the fame of erudition; and that those who are in natural and not in spiritual affection believe that when they know these things they know everything.

[3] I will also say something from experience about these things. Some spirits who were believed by others when they lived as men in the world to be men of learning, were examined to ascertain whether they knew what spiritual faith is. They said that they knew. They were therefore sent to those who were in that faith; and when they were given communication with these they perceived that they had no faith, and did not know what faith is. They were then asked what they now believe about faith alone, on which the whole doctrine of their church is founded, but they were ashamed and dumb-founded. There were also many of the learned of the church who were asked about regeneration, whether they knew what it is; they replied that they knew that it is baptism, since the Lord says, that “unless a man is born of water and spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God;” but when it was shown them that baptism is not regeneration, but that “water and spirit” mean truths and a life according to them, and that no one can enter heaven unless he is regenerated through these, they went away confessing their ignorance. Again, when they were asked about angels, about heaven and hell, about the life of man after death, and many other matters, they knew nothing, and these things were all like thick darkness in their minds. They therefore confessed that they had believed that they knew all things, but they now know that they know scarcely anything. Knowing something means, in the spiritual world, knowing something of truth; but knowing falsities is not knowing, because it is not understanding and being wise. They were afterwards told that this is meant by the Lord’s words, “Because thou sayest I am rich, and have gotten riches, and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked.” [4] The “rich” in the Word signify those who are in truths, because spiritual riches are nothing else; and therefore “riches” in the Word signify the knowledges of truth and good, and “the rich” those who are in intelligence thereby; as can be seen from the following passages.

These things were said to the prince of Tyre, by whom in the spiritual sense those who are in the knowledges of truth are meant; “wealth” means those knowledges themselves in general; “gold in treasures” mean the knowledges of good, and “silver in treasures” the knowledges of truth. That these signify knowledges is very clear, for it is said, “In thy wisdom and in thine intelligence thou hast made to thee wealth, and by the abundance of thy wisdom thou hast multiplied to thee wealth.” (”The prince of Tyre” means those who are in the knowledges of truth, because “prince” signifies primary truths, Arcana Coelestia, n. 1482, 2089, 5044; and “Tyre” the knowledges of truth, n. 1201; “treasures” signify the possessions of knowledges, n. 1694, 4508, 10227; “gold” signifies good, and “silver” truth, n. 1551, 1552, 2954, 5658.) [5] In Zechariah: Tyre heapeth up silver as dust, and gold as the mire of the streets; behold the Lord will impoverish her, and smite her wealth in the sea (9:3, 4). Here also “Tyre” stands for those who acquire for themselves knowledges, which are “silver,” “gold,” and “wealth.” In David: The daughter of Tyre shall bring to thee a gift, the king’s daughter; the rich of the people shall entreat thy faces (Ps. 45:12, 13). Here is described the church in respect to the affection of truth, which is meant by “the king’s daughter,” for “daughter” means the church in respect to affection (Arcana Coelestia, n. 3262, 3963, 6729, 9059; and “king” means truth, n. 1672, 2015, 2069, 3670, 4575, 4581, 4966, 6148). For this reason it is said that “the daughter of Tyre shall bring a gift,” and that “the rich of the people shall untried thy faces;” “the rich of the people” are those who abound in truths."

This treats of those who acquire for themselves knowledges with no other purpose than merely to know, when, yet knowledges ought to be subservient to the life. This is what is meant by “gathering as the partridge and not bringing forth,” and by “making riches but not with judgment;” and by “becoming foolish in the end of days.” And as the knowledges of truth and good ought to be subservient to the life, for by these the life will be perfected, it is said that “Jehovah gives to everyone according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings.” [8] In Luke: Whosoever he be of you that renounceth not all his possessions, he cannot be My disciple (14:33)."

[9] They who do not know that “the rich” mean those who possess the knowledges of truth and good, thus who have the Word, and that “the poor” mean those who do not possess knowledges, but yet long for them, can know no otherwise than that “the rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen,” and “the poor man who was laid at his gate” (Luke 16), mean the rich and the poor in the common acceptation of these words, when yet “the rich man” there means the Jewish nation, which had the Word, in which are all the knowledges of truth and good; the “purple” with which be was clothed means genuine good (Arcana Coelestia, n. 9467); “fine linen” genuine truth (Arcana Coelestia, n. 5319, 9469, 9596, 9744); and “the poor man who was laid at his gate” means the Gentiles that were outside of the church, and did not have the Word, and yet longed for the truths and goods of heaven and the church.

This is evident from the signification of “wretchedness,” as meaning the breaking up of truth by means of falsities, and also no coherence; this shows what is meant by “the wretched.” They are so because their doctrine is founded on two false principles, which are faith alone and justification by faith; consequently falsities flow in from these in constant succession, and the truths which they adduce from the sense of the letter of the Word to confirm these are weakened and falsified, and truths when falsified are in themselves falsities. This is described in many passages in the Word, and is meant by the “vanities” that the prophets see, and the “lies” that they speak. It is described also by the “breaches” in the walls and houses so that they fall; likewise by “idols” and “graven images” that the artificer makes and connects by chains that they may cohere; for “idols” and “graven images” signify the falsities of doctrine; the like is signified by “breaches of the walls” and “of the houses,” and by “the prophets who see vanities and speak lies;” for “prophets” mean doctrines, “vanities” such things as are of no account, and “lies” falsities. But as these things are mentioned in many passages in the Word they cannot be cited here on account of their abundance; they will therefore be omitted, and a few only quoted here in which “wretchedness” and “wall” are mentioned, that it may be known that these signify the weakening of truth by falsities, and thus no coherence.

The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with astonishment (7:26, 27). Here the vastation of the church is treated of, which takes place when there is no truth that is not falsified. Falsity from falsity is meant by “wretchedness upon wretchedness;” “a vision from the prophet” is doctrine, here the doctrine of falsity; “the law hath perished from the priest” means that the Word is not understood, for “law” signifies the Word, and the “priest” one who teaches; “counsel hath perished from the elders” means that right hath perished from the intelligent, “counsel” signifying right, and “elders” the intelligent; “the king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with astonishment,” means that there is no longer any truth, “king” signifying truth, and “prince” truths that are primarily of service.

Is it not said unto you, Where is the daubing wherewith ye have daubed it? (13:10–12). “The wall which they daub with untempered mortar” signifies falsity assumed as a principle, and by application of the Word from the sense of the letter made to appear as truth; “daubing” is application and seeming confirmation thereby; “untempered mortar” is what has been falsified; and because the truth of the Word is thus destroyed, and the truths used to confirm become truths falsified, which in themselves are falsities, and these with the false principle perish together, it is said, “Behold, the wall shall fall.

Those who have adopted faith alone and justification by faith as a principle of religion, when they read the Word and see that the Lord says that man shall be recompensed according to his deeds and works, and that he who has done good, shall come into heaven, and he who has done evils into hell, call the good things that they do fruits of faith, not knowing or not willing to know, that the good things called fruits are all from charity, and none of them from faith separate, which is called faith alone; every good also is of charity, and truth is of the faith therefrom. From this it is clear that they pervert the Word; and they do this because they cannot otherwise apply truth to their principle, believing still that the two may thus cohere; but the result is that truth perishes and becomes falsity, and not only falsity but also evil. [8] From this falsities evidently follow in constant succession, for they teach that the good works that man does are meritorious, not being willing to see that as faith with its truths are from the Lord, and thus not meritorious, so are charity with its goods. They teach also that as soon as a man receives faith he is reconciled to God the Father through the Son, and that the evils thenceforth done, as well as those done before, are not imputed; for they say that all are saved how ever they have lived, if only they receive faith, even though it be in the hours before death. But these, and many other things which are deductions from the falsity of the principle, do not cohere with the truths from the Word, but destroy them, and truths destroyed are falsities,even such falsities as emit a bad odor. From these a grievous smell is perceived in the other life, which is such that it cannot be endured by any good spirit; it is like the stench of purulent matter from the lungs. Many other examples might be adduced; there is an abundance of them; for whatever is deduced from a false principle becomes thereby a falsity, since in the deduction the principle only is regarded to which it clings because from this it flows and to this it is applied."

Such a sphere flows out from them because they adulterate the goods of charity and of the Word, and adulteries correspond to adulterations of good, while whoredoms correspond to the falsifications of truth (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 2466, 2729, 3399, 4865, 6348, 8904, 10648). [10] There is a like meaning in: Reuben’s lying with Bilhah, of whom his father begat Dan and Naphtali (Gen. 35:22); And therefore he was also accursed (Gen. 49:4); And because he defiled his father’s couch the primogeniture was taken away from him and given to Joseph (1 Chron. 5:1). For by “Reuben” in the Word faith is meant, and here faith alone (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 3325, 3861, 3866, 3870, 4601, 4605, 4731, 4734, 4761, 6342, 6350); and by “Joseph,” the good of faith (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 3969, 3971, 4669, 6417).

By “iron” truth without good is meant; by “miry clay” the falsity that is from self-intelligence; by “the seed of man” the Word of the Lord (Matt. 13:24, 37).

And miserable and poor, signifies that they do not know that they have neither knowledges of truth nor knowledges of good. This is evident from the signification of “miserable” or “pitiable,” as meaning those who are in no knowledges of truth; and from the signification of “poor” as meaning those who are in no knowledges of good. That this is the meaning of “miserable” and “poor” is evident from many passages in the Word, and also from this, that spiritual misery and poverty are nothing else than a lack of the knowledges of truth and good, for the spirit is then miserable and poor; but when the spirit possesses these it is rich and wealthy; therefore also “riches” and “wealth” in the Word signifies spiritual riches and wealth, which are the knowledges of truth and good (as was shown just above, n. 236). [2] “Miserable and poor” are terms used in many passages in the Word. He who is ignorant of the spiritual sense of the Word believes that by these no others are meant than the miserable and poor in the world. These, however, are not meant, but those who are not in truths and goods and in the knowledges thereof; and by the “miserable” indeed, those who are not in truths because not in the knowledges of truths, and by the “poor” those who are not in goods because not in the knowledges of goods. As these two, truths and goods, are meant by these two expressions, the two in many places are mentioned together; as in the passages that now follow. In David: I am miserable and poor, Lord, remember me (Ps. 40:17; 70:5). Incline Thine ear, O Jehovah, answer me, for I am miserable and poor (Ps. 86:1). The “miserable and poor” here mean evidently those who are miserable and poor, not in respect to worldly riches but in respect to spiritual riches, as David says this of himself; therefore he also said, “Jehovah, incline thine ear, and answer me.” [3] In the same:"

[4] So in another place in the same: The wicked man hath persecuted the miserable and poor and the broken in heart, to slay them (Ps. 109:16).

He counseleth wicked devices to destroy the miserable by words of a lie, even when the poor speaketh judgment (32: 6, 7). Here likewise “the miserable and poor” mean those who are destitute of the knowledges of truth and good, therefore it is said that “the wicked counseleth wicked devices to destroy the miserable by the words of a lie, even when the poor speaketh judgment;” “by the words of a lie” means by falsities, and “to speak judgment” is to speak what is right. Because such are treated of, it is also said that he “practices hypocrisy and speaketh error against Jehovah, to make empty the hungry soul and to make him who thirsteth for drink to want.” “To practice hypocrisy and to speak error” is to do evil from falsity, and to speak falsity from evil; “to make empty the hungry soul” is to deprive those of the knowledges of god who long for them, and “to make him who thirsteth for drink to want” is to"

He shall deliver the poor when he crieth, and the miserable. He shall spare the weak and the poor, and the souls of the poor He shall save (Ps. 72:4, 12, 13). The miserable shall see, they that seek Jehovah shall be glad. For Jehovah heareth the poor (Ps. 49:32, 33). Jehovah deliverest the miserable from him that is too strong for him, the poor from them that despoil him (Ps. 35:10). The miserable and the poor praise Thy name (Ps. 74:21; 109:22). I know that Jehovah will maintain the cause of the miserable, and the judgment of the poor (Ps. 140:12). Also elsewhere (as Isa. 10:2; Jer. 22:16; Ezek. 16:49; 18:12; 22:29; Amos 8:4; Deut. 15:11; 24:14). “The miserable” and “the poor” are both mentioned in these passages, because it is according to the style of the Word that where truth is spoken of, good is also spoken of; and in a contrary sense, where falsity is spoken of, evil is also"

(That there is such a marriage almost everywhere in the prophetical parts of the Word, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 683, 793, 801, 2516, 2712, 3004, 3005, 3009, 4138, 5138, 5194, 5502, 6343, 7022, 7945, 8339, 9263, 9314.) For the same reason it is said in what follows, “and blind and naked;” for by “the blind” one who is in no understanding of truth is meant, and by “the naked” one who is in no understanding and will of good. So in the following verse, “I counsel thee to buy of Me gold tried by fire, and white garments that thou mayest be clothed;” for by “bold tried by fire” the food of love is meant, and by “white garments” the truths of faith. And further, “That the shame of thy nakedness be not manifest; and anoint thine eyes with eye salve, that thou mayest see,” which means, lest evils and falsities be seen. So also elsewhere. But that there is such a marriage in the particulars of the Word, none but those who know its internal sense can see. 239a. And blind and naked, signifies that they are without the understanding of truth, and without the understanding and will of good. This is evident from the signification of “blind,” as being those who are without the understanding of truth (of which presently); and from the signification of “naked,” as being those who are without the will of good, and thus without the understanding of it (of which presently). That those who are in the doctrine of faith alone and of justification by faith are without the understanding of truth, can be seen from this, that faith alone, or faith apart from charity, has its seat altogether in the memory, with nothing of it in the understanding; those, therefore, who are in it withdraw the understanding from matters of faith, saying that these must be believed, and that the understanding has nothing to do with matters of faith; thus they can say whatsoever they wish, even if most false, provided they know how to adduce something in proof of it from the sense of the letter of the Word, the spiritual sense of which they know nothing about; in this there lurks something like the decree of the popes, which is that all should bang on their mouth; thus persuading the people that they know"

Those, therefore, who do not see, that is, understand the things they believe, are “blind.” And in consequence of this also they are unable to perfect the life by means of the things pertaining to faith; for the understanding is the way to man’s life; by no other way can man become spiritual. All who are in heaven see truths with the understanding, and thus receive them; but what they do not see with the understanding they do not receive; and if anyone says to them that they must have faith, although they do not see or understand, they turn away, saying, “How can this be? I believe what I see or understand; but I am unable to believe what I do not see or understand; such things may be falsities that destroy spiritual life.” [2] That those who are in the doctrine of faith alone and justification by faith are without the understanding of good, because they are without the will of good, can be seen from this, that they know nothing whatever about charity towards the neighbor, consequently nothing about good; for all spiritual good is from charity, and there is nothing without charity; consequently those who separate faith from charity, saying that charity contributes nothing to salvation, but only faith, are altogether ignorant of what good is because they are ignorant of what charity is, and yet spiritual good and the affection of it that is called charity is the spiritual life of man, and without it there is no faith. From this it is clear that such are without the understanding of good. And this is in consequence of their being without the will of good, for the reason that they declare themselves to be righteous [just] or to have been made righteous [justified] when they have faith; and by “justified” they mean not to be condemned on account of anything that they think and will, since they have been reconciled to God; consequently they believe, because it follows by connection with their principle, that the evil equally with the good are saved if only they receive faith, even if this should be in the last hours of life. The mysteries of this doctrine consist in this, that they speak of progressive steps of justification that are not from anything of man’s life, or from his affection of charity, but are from mere faith in the reconciliation of God the Father through the Son, which faith they call confidence or trust, and saving faith itself; not knowing that where there is nothing of charity there can be"

That which is interiorly perceived or is manifest in their confidence, still has nothing in it derived from spiritual affection, but only from natural thought about happiness or about escape from damnation. [3] Moreover, those who know nothing about the good of charity have no will of good, and those who know nothing about this good know nothing about evil, for good discloses evil, consequently such persons cannot examine themselves, see their evils, and thus shun them and reject them. They therefore relax all restraints on their thought and their will, only being careful on account of the laws, the loss of fame, of honor, of gain, and of life, to avoid evil doings. And for this reason when such persons become spirits and these fears are taken away from them, they associate themselves with devils, for they think and will as devils do, because they so thought in the world; for it is the spirit in man that thinks. But it is otherwise with those who have lived a life of charity. [4] Again, those who believe that they have been justified by faith alone, are of the opinion that they are led by God, and therefore that what they do is good, saying, that all good is from God, and nothing from man, and that otherwise good would be meritorious. They do not know that there ought to be reception on man’s part, and that reception is not possible unless man gives heed to his thoughts and intentions, and thence to his deeds; and then refrains from evils and does good, which is done when he has regard for the truths that he knows from the Word, and lives according to them. Unless man does this, there is nothing reciprocal, and therefore no reformation; and of what other use are the precepts of the Lord in the Word? That man is able to do this is also from the Lord, for every man has this faculty from the Lord’s Divine presence, and His will that there be reception. In a word, unless man receives in the understanding and will, that is, in the thought and affection, or what is the same, in faith and love, there is no reception on his part, consequently no conjunction with the Lord.

The Lord teaches the same elsewhere in the Word. As in John: He that loveth Me keepeth My words; and My Father will love him, and We will come unto him, and make Our abode with him. He that loveth Me not keepeth not My words (14:23, 24).

In this passage, the restoration of the church is treated of, and “the deaf who shall hear the words of the book” mean those who are willing to obey truths, and thus to live a life of good, but are not able because they have not the Word, and “the blind whose eyes shall see in thick darkness, and in darkness,” means that those who are in no understanding of truth because in ignorance, are then to understand.

[18] In the same: Jesus said, For judgment came I unto this world, that they who see not may see, and that they who see may become blind. They said, Are we blind then? Jesus said, If ye were blind ye would not have sin; but now ye say, We see, therefore your sin remaineth (9:39–41). “They who see not” mean those who are outside of the church and do not know truths because they have not the word, thus the Gentiles; but “they who see” mean those who are within the church and have the Word, thus the Jews; of these it is said that “they shall become blind;” but of the former, that “they shall see.” It is said that “their sin remaineth” because they say that they are not blind but see, for the reason that they are in the church where the Word is, and yet are not willing to see and acknowledge truths, nor, consequently, the Lord. On this account the Scribes and Pharisees among the Jews were called by the Lord: Blind guides of the blind (Matt. 15:14; Luke 6:39). Also blind guides, fools, and foolish (Matt. 23:16, 17, 19, 24).

That this is what is meant by it has been hitherto concealed. (That “ground” signifies the church, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 566, 10570; that “clay” signifies good from which is truth, thus good forming, n. 1300, 6669; that “the pool of Siloam” signifies the Word in the sense of the letter, is evident in Isaiah 8:6; and that “the pools” that were in Jerusalem in general signify this, Isaiah 22:9, 11.)

These laws were enacted because the church instituted among the sons of Israel was a representative church, in which all things represented spiritual things because they corresponded to them. Therefore also the following curse is pronounced upon those who do not keep the commandments, in Moses: If thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of thy God, to observe to do all His commandments. Jehovah shall smite thee with madness and blindness and astonishment of heart; that thou mayest grope at noonday, as the blind gropeth in thick darkness (Deut. 28:15, 28, 29). This also means that those shall be smitten with spiritual blindness and astonishment who do not hearken to the voice of the Lord by doing those things that He has commanded in the Word. Spiritual blindness of the eyes and spiritual astonishment of the heart mean no understanding of the truth and no will of good; “to grope at noonday” is to be such in the church, where the light of truth is given through the Word.

[2] There is the understanding of truth, and the understanding of good; the understanding of truth is the understanding of such things as are of faith, and the understanding of good is the understanding of such things as are of love and charity. There is also the will of truth and the will of good; the will of truth is with those who are of the Lord’s spiritual kingdom; but the will of good with those who are of His celestial kingdom. The latter, because they are in love to the Lord, and from this in mutual love, which is to them charity towards the neighbor, have truths inscribed on their hearts, and thence do them; and what proceeds out of the heart is out of the will of good, “heart” meaning the will of good. But those who are in love towards the neighbor, which love is charity, have truths inscribed not on their hearts but on the memory, and therefore on the intellectual mind, and what proceeds therefrom out of the affection is the will of truth. Thus it is that spiritual angels are distinguished from celestial angels. The latter appear naked in heaven, but the former clothed. Celestial angels appear naked because they have no need of the memory to retain truths, nor of understanding therefrom to comprehend them, because they have them inscribed on the heart, that is, on the love and will, and thence see them. But spiritual angels appear clothed because they have truths inscribed on the memory and thence on the understanding, and truths of the memory and of the understanding therefrom correspond to garments; they therefore all appear clothed according to their intelligence. (That angels are thus clothed, see in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 177–182.)

By “prophet” the doctrine of the church is here meant; “putting off the sackcloth from his loins,” or presenting the loins naked, means to disclose filthy loves; the customary “sackcloth” of the prophet here means the breeches that cover, and “the loin” signify such loves; “putting off the shoe from upon his foot,” or unshoeing the soles of the foot, signifies to disclose the filthy things of nature; that “the king of Assyria shall lead the captivity of Egypt, and the crowd of Cush that is to be carried away,” means that the perverted rational will confirm evils and falsities by means of knowledges (scientifica) and by means of fallacies; “lads and old men” means by means of all things both general and particular; “naked and barefoot” means that they are deprived of all truth and all good; “buttocks bare” means the evils of self-love; “the nakedness of Egypt” means falsities therefrom. From this it is clear what things of the church and of heaven are here treated of, namely, that the perverted rational, which is the rational that denies God and attributes all things to nature, confirms itself by means of knowledges and fallacies, until it is destitute of all the understanding of truth and the will of good. (That “prophet” in the Word means doctrine, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 2534, 7269; that the “loins” signify loves in both senses, n. 3021, 4280, 5059; that “feet” signify the natural things with man, and “the soles of the feet” the things that are in ultimates, n. 2162, 3147, 3761, 3986, 4280, 4938–4952; that “shoes” signify these same things in respect to their covering, n. 1748, 2162, 4835, 6844; that “the king of Assyria” signifies the rational in both senses, n. 119, 1186; that “Egypt” signifies the faculty of knowing (scientificum) of the natural man, in both senses, good and bad, n. 1164, 1165, 1186, 1462, 5700, 5702, 6015, 6651, 6679, 6683, 6692, 7296, 9340,"

This is the case with those within the church when those who teach are in falsities, and with those outside of the church who do not have the Word and consequently do not know truths and thence know nothing about the Lord.

To buy of Me gold tried by fire, that thou mayest be enriched, signifies that they should acquire for themselves from the Lord genuine good, that they may be able to receive the truths of faith. This is evident from the signification of “buying,” as being to acquire and appropriate to oneself (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 4397, 5374, 5397, 5406, 5410, 5426); also from the signification of “gold tried by fire,” as being genuine good, thus good from the Lord (of which presently); also from the signification of “that thou mayest be enriched,” as being to be enabled to receive the truths of faith. This is the signification of being “enriched,” because “riches” and “wealth” signify the knowledges of truth and good, and “the rich” are those who are in intelligence by means of knowledges, here, those who are in faith by means of them, since those who are in the doctrine of faith alone are here treated of. From this it is clear that “to buy of Me gold tried by fire, that thou mayest be enriched,” signifies that they must acquire for themselves genuine good from the Lord so that they may receive the truths of faith. [2] It shall first be told how this is to be understood. It has often been said before, that there is no truth which is truth in itself unless it be from good, thus no faith that is faith in itself unless it be from charity; for there is no truth that is truth in itself unless there is spiritual life within it, and spiritual life is within it when it is formed out of the food of charity; for truth is the form of good, and good is the esse of truth, thus also its life; and good is from no other source than from the Lord. When there is good from the Lord, the truth that is from the good looks primarily to the Lord and also to the neighbor and his good, for the Lord flows in with good and by it forms truth, which is the truth of faith, and causes man’s spiritual sight to look to him and to the neighbor. (That this is so, may be seen in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 145, 251, namely, that the Lord looks at angels and men in the forehead, and these look to the Lord through the eyes; for the reason that the forehead corresponds to the good of love, and the eyes to the"

Also in the same work, n. 17, 123, 124 142–144, 510, it is shown that in the spiritual world all are turned to their own loves, and those who have acknowledged the Lord and believed in Him are turned to Him, and thereby have good, and through good, illustration in respect to truths.) From this it can be seen what the genuine good is that is signified by “gold tried by fire,” namely, that it is good from the Lord alone. [3] As what is written to the angel of this church treats of those who live according to the doctrine of faith alone, and as those who had confirmed themselves in that doctrine, and were on that account called learned in the world, were able to join falsities with truths and make the doctrine appear as if it were true, therefore, it was granted me to talk with some of them in the other life; and as the things that were then said on either side may serve for illustration I will present them. These learned ones, from their belief while in the world, supposed that there might be faith without charity, and that man may be justified by that alone. Their talk was very ingenious; they said that there is faith without charity, because it is prior to charity, and because by it man is in good. “Who,” they said, “is not able to believe that there is a God, that the Word is Divine, and other like truths, which unless believed could not be received and thought of by man?” From this they concluded that as faith precedes, or is prior to, charity, there can be faith without charity; and if there can be, that it must be saving, since man cannot do good from himself; unless, therefore, that faith were saving all would perish: moreover, without faith there could be no presence of God with man; and without the presence of God evil would reign, and no one would have any good. This they said, is what is meant by justification by faith alone. But it was shown them that there could not be faith unless there was at the same time charity; and that what they called faith was nothing but the knowledges that are first with every man; for example, that there is a God, that the Word is Divine, and the like, and that these knowledges are not in the man before they are in his will, but are in the entrance to him, which is his memory; but so far as they are in his will so far they are in the man himself, for the will is the man himself; and so far as they are in the will so far they are in his sight,"

The knowledges themselves that precede, and that appear to the natural sight as if believed, do not until then come to be of faith; consequently this seeing the knowledges, that is thought to be of faith, recedes step by step from man as he begins from willing evil to think evil, and also recedes from him after death when man becomes a spirit, if the knowledges have not been rooted in his life, that is, in his will or love. [4] This may be illustrated by a comparison with the stomachs of birds and beasts of the earth that are called ruminating stomachs. Into these they first collect their food, and afterwards by degrees take it out and eat it, and thus nourish the blood; food thus becomes a part of their life. With man the memory corresponds to these stomachs; and man is endowed with memory instead of these because he is spiritual; into this he first gathers spiritual foods, which are knowledges, and afterwards he takes them out by a sort of ruminating, that is, by thinking and willing, and appropriates them, and thus makes them a part of his life. From this comparison, although trifling, it can be seen that knowledges, unless implanted in the life by thinking and willing them and then doing them, are like food that remains unconsumed in ruminating stomachs, where it either becomes putrid or is vomited out. Moreover, the circle of man’s life is to know, to understand, to will, and to do; for man’s spiritual life begins with knowing, passes next to understanding, then to willing, and finally to doing. From this it is clear that so long as knowledges are in the memory they are merely in the entrance to the life, and that they are not fully in man until they are in acts, and the more fully they are in acts the more fully they are in the understanding and will. 242b. [5] It was further shown that the faith of knowledges before it becomes the faith of life is historical faith, the nature of which is well known, namely, that it is believed because another has said it; until this has been made man’s own it is an alien thing, or something with oneself belonging to some one else. Historical faith, moreover, is like a belief in things unknown, for it is said that things must be believed though not understood, yea, that they must not be searched into by the understanding; and yet spiritual faith is"

In heaven no one believes any truth unless he sees it or has seen it; for they say, “who can believe that a thing is so unless he sees it? it may possibly be false.” And only the evil can believe what is false; for the evil from evil see falsities, but the good from good see truths; and as good is from the Lord, so also seeing truth from good is from the Lord. Angels see truths because the light of heaven, in which they are, is Divine truth proceeding from the Lord; all, therefore, even those in the world, who are in that light are able to see truth. (Of the light of heaven, and that it is such, see in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 126–140.) [6] It was then shown that charity and faith act as one and enter together into man, thus that man is so far in faith as he is in charity, since faith as to its essence is charity, just as truth as to its essence is good; for good, when it exists in shape or in form is truth; in like manner charity is faith, for good is of charity and truth is of faith; moreover, the one loves the other and conjoins itself to the other, therefore one is not given unless the other be with it. This was illustrated by man’s thought, which is of his understanding, and his affection, which is of his will; to think apart from affection is impossible, for the very essence of thought is affection or love. Man is able, to be sure, to think all things that he knows from the doctrine of the church, but only from a natural affection, which is the affection or love of glory, fame, honor or gain; but such an affection does not make thought to be spiritual; this requires charity, which is spiritual affection itself. When this is conjoined with knowledges there is faith, and then so far as man is in that affection he sees in thought the things that are of his faith, which are called truths, and acknowledges them, because they are from his very spirit, thus from his very spiritual life. This also is what is called illustration; and this is why no one can be illustrated from the Word unless he is in the spiritual affection of truth. Something like illustration there is, indeed, with those who have confirmed themselves in such things as are of the doctrine of faith alone and justification by faith; but that illustration is a fatuous illustration, since falsities as well as truths can be confirmed, like all those heresies that prevail both among the Jews and among Papists.

(That the light of confirmation is natural, not spiritual, and exists also with the evil, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 8780.) 242c. [7] But let us return to the faith that in its essence is charity. That faith is continually perfected by such things as confirm; for from spiritual light more truths are constantly being seen, and all these join themselves to the good of charity, and perfect it. From this man has intelligence and wisdom, which at length become angelic. Moreover, those who are merely in the knowledges of faith, and not in a life according to them, believe that man can easily receive faith, if not in the world yet in another life, saying within themselves, “When I hear and see that a thing is so can I not believe it?” But they are greatly mistaken; for those who have not received spiritual faith in the world can never afterwards receive it, even if they were to hear of it and see it a thousand times; and for the reason that such a faith is not in man, but outside of him. That this is so can be clearly seen from this, that all who come from the world are first received by angels and good spirits, and instructed in every way, yea, many things are shown them to the life and before their very eyes, and yet they do not receive; thus they alienate themselves from angels and good spirits, and join those who are in no faith. [8] Again, it was also told them, that if faith could be received by merely knowing and thinking it would be received by all, the evil and the good alike, and thus no one would be damned. That charity, which is spiritual affection, can never be given to anyone unless he knows truths, examines himself by means of them, accepts them, and leads a new life in accordance with them, may be seen above (n. 239). From this it follows than charity is the life of faith, and that there is nothing of life in faith except in the measure of the charity that is in it; and also that in the measure that charity is in faith man is led by the Lord, but in the measure that charity is not in faith man is led by himself; and he who is led by himself and not by the Lord is unable to think of good, still less to will and do"

When this had been said, it was granted to those with whom I was talking on this subject to be in spiritual light, which light is such that in it truths can be seen as clearly as objects in the world are seen in its light; and then those who were in the doctrine of faith alone and justification by faith could not but affirm that this was true; but as soon as that light was taken away from them, and they were let back into their own light, which was natural, they were unable to see otherwise than that the sight of knowledges is saving faith, and therefore that the falsities that they had made part of their faith were truths. Falsities come to be of the faith when evils are of the life. 242d.

It now remains to be shown that “gold” in the Word signifies the good of love. This can be seen from the following passages. In Malachi: Behold, I send My angel [messenger] who shall prepare the way before Me; and the Lord whom ye seek shall suddenly come to His temple, even the angel of the covenant whom ye desire; He shall sit refining and purifying silver, and shall purify the sons of Levi, and shall purge them as gold and silver, that they may bring to Jehovah an offering in righteousness (3:1–3).

(That “temple” signifies the Lord’s Divine Human, see above, n. 220a; that “covenant” signifies conjunction, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 665, 666, 1023, 1038, 1864, 1996, 2003, 2021, 6804, 8767, 8778, 9396, 10632; that “silver” signifies truth from good, n. 1551, 1552, 2954, 5658; that “an offering” signifies the good of love and charity, n. 4581, 9992–9994, 10079, 10137; that “righteousness” is predicated of good, n. 2235, 9857.) Therefore “to bring an offering in righteousness” signifies worship from the good of love. [10] In Zechariah: Two parts in all the land shall be cut off, shall expire, but the third shall be left therein. Yet I will lead the third part through the fire, and will refine them as silver is refined, and I will try them as gold is tried. (13:8, 9). “All the land” does not mean all the land, but the whole church; nor does “the third part” mean a third part, but some in the church. “To lead it through the fire, and refine as silver is refined, and to try as gold is tried,” signifies to so purify them from falses and evils that good and truth may be implanted. (That “earth” [land] in the Word signifies the church, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 662, 1066, 1068, 1262, 1413, 1607, 2928, 3355, 4447, 4535, 5577, 6516, 9325, 9643; that “a third part” signifies some, n. 2788.)

Because “gold tried by fire” signifies the good of love purified from evils, it was commanded: That the gold and silver taken from the Midianites should be passed through the fire, and thus be purified (Num. 31:22, 23). [11] That “gold” signifies the good of love and of charity is shown further in the following passages. In Hosea: Israel hath forsaken good; the enemy pursueth him; they have made their silver and their gold into idols for themselves (8:3, 4). “Making their silver and their gold into idols for themselves” signifies that they have turned truth and good into falsities and evils, as is evident from its being said, “Israel hath forsaken good, and the enemy pursueth him;” “the enemy” is falsity from evil, and evil from falsity. [12] In Joel: What are ye to Me, O Tyre and Zidon? My silver and My gold ye have taken, and the desirable things of My goods have ye brought into your temples, and the sons of Judah, and the sons of Jerusalem ye have sold to the sons of the Grecians, that ye might remove them far from their borders (3:4–6). “Tyre and Zidon” mean those within the church who are in the knowledges of truth and good; here those who have perverted these, and applied them to falsities and to the evils of falsities; this is signified by “Ye have taken My silver and My gold, and the desirable things of My goods have ye brought into your temples;” “silver” signifying truth, “gold” good, and “the desirable things of goods” signifying derived truths and goods, which are knowledges from the sense of the letter of the Word; “to bring them into their temples” signifies to turn them into profane worship; that “they sold the sons of Judah and the sons of Jerusalem to the sons of the Grecians” means that they changed all the truths of good Into the falsities of evil; “removing them far from their borders” means far from truths themselves.

Thou wast in Eden, the garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering, and gold (28:4, 13). In these two passages also Tyre is treated of, and by it, as was said above, those within the church who are in the knowledges of truth and good are meant.

The “Medes” mean those who are against the truths and goods of the church; it is therefore said of them, “they shall not value silver nor delight in gold;” “silver” is the truth of the church, and “gold” its good. Their “bows” signify the doctrinals of falsity fighting agaInst truths and goods (Arcana Coelestia, n. 2686, 2709); “the young men whom they shall dash to pieces” signify those who are intelligent from truths (n. 7668); “the sons whom they shall not spare” signify the truths themselves.

Like things are signified by: The wise men who came from the East to the place where Christ was born, offering gifts, gold, frankincense, and myrrh (Matt. 2:11). They offered these because these signified goods and truths, interior and exterior, which are gifts pleasing to God. [18] In David: All kings shall bow themselves before Him; and all nations shall serve Him. He shall save the souls of the needy. And they shall live, and He shall give them of the gold of Sheba (Ps. 72:11, 13, 15). Here also the coming of the Lord is treated of; by “kings that shall bow themselves before Him,” and “nations that shall serve Him,” all who are in truths from good are meant (that “kings” signify those who are in truths, see above, n. 31; and that “nations” signify those who are in good, see also above, n. 175a); “the needy whom He shall save” mean those who are not in the knowledges of good and truth but yet long for them (see also above, n. 238); “the gold of Sheba, of which He shall give them,” means the good of love into which the Lord shall lead them by means of knowledges (what “Sheba” signifies see just above). [19] In Haggai: I will stir up all nations, that they may come, the choice of all nations, and I will fill this house with glory. The silver is Mine, and the gold. The glory of this latter house shall be greater than that of the former (2:7–9). This also treats of the coming of the Lord; by “nations” those who are in good and in truths therefrom are meant; by “house” the church (Arcana Coelestia, n. 3720); “the glory with which it shall be filled” means Divine truth (n. 4809, 5922, 8267, 8427, 9429). “The silver is Mine, and the gold,” means that truth and good are from the Lord alone."

The like was signified by: The gold, silver, and garments that the sons of Israel borrowed from the Egyptians, when they went away from them (Exod. 3:22; 11:2, 3; 12:35, 36). Why this was done, and what it involves, may be seen in the Arcana Coelestia (n. 6914, 6917), namely, to represent that the things the evil have shall be taken away from them and given to the good (according to the Lord’s words in Matt. 25:28, 29; and in Luke 19:24, 26); and that they should make to themselves friends by the unrighteous mammon (according to the words of the Lord in Luke 16:9). “The unrighteous mammon” means the knowledges of truth and good with those who do not possess them justly, who are those that do not apply them to life.

Because “gold” signified the good of love: The table on which the shewbread was placed was overlaid with gold (Exod. 25:23, 24); Likewise the altar of incense, which was thence called the golden altar (Exod. 30:3); For the same reason the lampstand was made of pure gold (Exod. 25:31, 38); Also the cherubim (Exod. 25:18); And for the same reason the ark was overlaid within and without with gold (Exod. 25:11); Likewise many things in the temple at Jerusalem.

As in Moses: The silver and gold of the nations they shall not covet, for they are abominations, nor bring them into their houses, but they shall be accursed, because they are to be abhorred and abominated (Deut. 7:25, 26). But this signification of “gold” and “silver” shall be spoken of further on. 243. And white garments, that thou mayest be clothed, signifies genuine truths and intelligence therefrom. This is evident from the signification of “white garments,” as being genuine truths, for garments signify truths (see above, n. 195b), and “white” signifies what is genuine, and is predicated of truths (see above, n. 196); also from the signification of “to clothe,” as being to acquire intelligence for oneself therefrom, for by means of genuine truths all intelligence is acquired; for the human understanding is formed to receive truths, therefore it becomes such as the truths are out of which it is formed. It is supposed that understanding is also the ability to reason from thought and to speak from falsities, and to confirm falsities by many arguments; but this is not understanding, it is only a faculty granted to man with the memory to which it is adjoined, and of which it is an activity. Yet by means of this faculty the understanding is born and formed, so far as man receives truths from affection; but genuine truths it is not possible for any man to receive from affection except only from the Lord, since they are from Him; consequently, to receive understanding, or to become intelligent, is not given to any man, except only from the Lord, but it is given to everyone who applies himself to receive (according to what was said above, n. 239a).

And because this deprivation is signified by “nakedness,” “the shame of nakedness” signifies filthy loves, for these appear when they are not removed by the love of good and by the faith of truth therefrom. For man is born into two loves, which are the love of self and the love of the world, therefore by heredity he derives the inclination to love self and the world above all things; these loves are filthy loves, because out of them all evils flow, namely, contempt of others in comparison with oneself, enmity against those who do not favor oneself, hatred, revenge, craftiness, and deceits of every kind. These loves with their evils cannot be removed except by the two loves, which are the love to the Lord and the love towards the neighbor; from these man inclines to love the Lord above all things, and the neighbor as himself. These two loves are pure loves, since they are out of heaven from the Lord. Moreover, from these all goods flow; so far, therefore, as man is in these, so far the filthy loves into which he is born are removed, even until they do not appear; and they are removed by the Lord by means of truths. From this it can be seen that “I counsel thee to buy of Me white garments, that thou mayest be clothed, that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear,” signifies that they should acquire for themselves genuine truths, and from these intelligence from the Lord, that filthy loves may not appear. 245.

This is evident from the signification of “eyes,” as being the understanding (see above, n. 152); therefore “to anoint the eyes that thou mayest see” signifies that the understanding may be opened. It is said “to anoint with eye salve,” because “eye salve” means an ointment made out of flour mixed with oil, and “flour” signifies the truth of faith, and “oil” the good of love. (That “flour” signifies the truth of faith, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 2177, 9995; and that “oil” signifies the good of love, n. 3728, 4582, 4638.)

As many as I love I reprove and chasten, signifies temptations then. This is evident from the signification of “reproving and chastening,” as being to let into temptations, when it is said of those who are acquiring for themselves good, and by means of it are receiving truths, of whom the preceding verse treats. It is said “as many as I love,” which means all those in the doctrine of faith alone who are In good or in charity, and in truths, that is, in faith, therefrom. These are loved by the Lord, because the Lord is present in good, or in charity; and through good or charity is present in truths or faith, and not conversely. It is here said of those who are in the doctrine of faith alone that the Lord “reproves and chastens” them, because it was said above, “I counsel thee to buy of Me gold tried by fire, and white garments, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear, and anoint thine eyes with eye salve that thou mayest see,” which means that those who are in the doctrine of faith alone should acquire for themselves genuine good and genuine truths, and intelligence therefrom, that filthy loves may not appear, and that the understanding may be somewhat opened. And when this takes place with those who have been in the doctrine of faith alone, they cannot but be let into temptations; for the principles of falsity in them respecting faith alone and justification by faith cannot be done away with except by means of temptations; and they must be wholly done away with, since they cannot be conjoined with the god of charity, with this truths only are conjoined; therefore truths must be acquired, as has been said. There is, to be sure, a conjunction of truths through their declaring that after man has received faith he is led by God, and is thus in the good of charity; and yet they make this of no account, as contributing nothing to salvation, saying, moreover, that nothing condemns one who is in that faith, neither evil of thought and will nor evil of life; as also that he is not under the law, because the Lord has fulfilled the law for him; and that nothing is regarded except faith; by these things there is disjunction. That they conjoin them, is because otherwise the doctrine would not cohere with the Word, where charity and works are so often mentioned; but this conjunction is not"

[2] It is said, “As many as I love I reprove and chasten,” but by this it is meant not that it is the Lord who reproves and chastens, but infernal spirits, who are in principles of like falsity; it is these who chastise, that is, tempt men. God tempts no one, as is well known; this, therefore, must be thus understood, although in the letter it is said of God that He leads into temptation, that He does evil, that He casts into hell, and many like things. From this it is clear that Divine truth in the Word is but little understood except through its spiritual sense, or through doctrine from those who have been in illustration. In respect to temptations, man comes into them when he is let into what is his own (in suum proprium), for then spirits from hell who are in the falsities of his principle and in the evils of his love join themselves to him and hold his thoughts therein; but the Lord holds his thoughts in the truths that are of faith and in the goods that are of charity, and as he then is also in constant thought about salvation and heaven, there thence arises in him interior anxiety of mind and combat, which is called temptation. But those who are not In truths and goods, thus not in any faith from charity, cannot be let into temptations, for there is nothing with them that combats with falsities and evils. From this it is that at this day there are few who are tempted, and that it is little known what spiritual temptation is. (This is more fully explained in the Arcana Coelestia; see extracts therefrom in the Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, n. 196–201.) 247. Be zealous, therefore, and repent, signifies that they must have charity. This is evident from the signification of “being zealous,” as being to act from spiritual affection, for this affection is zeal in the spiritual sense; and as charity is this affection itself, it is said, “be zealous and repent,” which signifies that they must have charity. Moreover, no one is let into spiritual temptation unless he is in spiritual affection, which is called charity; for unless he is in that, no combat arises with falsities and evils, because there is no zeal in behalf of truths and goods.

Verse 20. Behold I stand at the door and knock, signifies the perpetual presence of the Lord. This is evident from the signification of “door or entrance,” as being in the highest sense the Lord in respect to admission into heaven or into the church, and in the internal sense truth from good, which is from Him, since by this man is admitted (see above, n. 208). Since it is here said by the Lord, “Behold, I stand at the door and knock,” not only His perpetual presence is signified, but also His perpetual wish to admit, and He does admit and conjoin Himself with all who receive Him, which is effected by means of truths from good or by means of faith from charity; therefore this follows, “If anyone hear My voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with Me.” As the word “door” is used, so the word “knocking” is used, which signifies the Lord’s perpetual wish to conjoin Himself with man, and to communicate to him the blessednesses of heaven. That this is the meaning can be seen from this, that in the Lord is Divine love, and Divine love is wishing to give all its own to others, and wishing that they may receive Him; and as this can be effected only by man’s receiving good and truth, or love and faith, since these are the Divine things that proceed from the Lord and are received (and as these are Divine, the Lord is in them), therefore there is conjunction of the Lord with the angels and with men by means of truths from good or by means of faith from love. The desire to give these things to man and to implant them in him is signified especially by, “I stand at the door and knock.” [2] There are two things that are in man’s freedom by reason of the perpetual presence of the Lord, and His perpetual desire to conjoin Himself with man. The first thing therefrom in man’s freedom is that he has the means and faculty to think well about the Lord and the neighbor; for everyone is able to think well or ill about the Lord and the neighbor; if he thinks well the door is opened, if ill it is shut.

The other thing which is in man’s freedom by reason of the perpetual presence of the Lord with him, and the Lord’s perpetual desire to conjoin Himself with man, is man’s ability to abstain from evils; and so far as he does abstain the Lord opens the door and enters; for the Lord is unable to open and enter so long as evils are in man’s thought and will, since these block the way and close it up. Moreover, it has been granted to man by the Lord to know the evils of the thought and will, as also the truths by which evils are to be dispersed; for the Word is given wherein these things are disclosed. [3] From this it can be seen that nothing is lacking that man may be reformed if he wishes to be; for all the means of reformation have been bequeathed to man in his freedom; but it should be well known that this freedom is from the Lord, as was said above, and that the Lord effects reformation thereby, provided man, from the freedom that is given to everyone, receives. There must absolutely be reception on the part of man, which is meant by “If anyone hear My voice and open the door.” It does not matter, if man, because he does not perceive the inflowing, does not know in the beginning that this is from the Lord, provided be afterwards believes from the Word that all the good of love and the truth of faith are from the Lord, for the Lord effects these things, although man does not know it, and this by His perpetual presence, which is signified by “I stand at the door and knock.” In short, it is the Lord’s wish that man of himself should abstain from evil things and do good, if he only believes that the ability to do so is not from man, but from the Lord; for it is the Lord’s will that there be reception on man’s part, and reception is possible only as man acts as of himself, though it is from the Lord. Thus something reciprocal is given with man, and this is his new will. [4] From this it can be seen how mistaken those are who say that man is justified and saved by faith alone, because he cannot do"

They also err who believe that they can make themselves receptive of influx by prayers, adorations, and the externals of worship; these things are of no effect unless man abstains from thinking and doing evils, and by truths from the Word leads himself, as of himself, to things good in respect to life; when man does this he makes himself receptive, and then his prayers, adorations, and externals of worship avail before the Lord. (On this see more in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 521–527.) 249. If anyone hear My voice, signifies if one attends to the Lord’s precepts. This is evident from the signification of “to hear,” as being to attend, that is, to observe with attention, and to hearken or obey; for the things that enter by the hearing are not only seen by the understanding, but also, if they are in accord with man’s affection, are obeyed; for interior affection joins itself to things heard, but not to things seen. There are therefore two significations of hearing and hearkening in common discourse, namely, to bear anyone or listen, and to hear to anyone or hearken to him; the latter means to obey, but the former means to perceive; consequently “hear thou” means to be obedient, and “see thou” means to be intelligent. Such things in common discourse have their origin in the spiritual world, in which man is in respect to his spirit (see above, n. 14 and 108). This is evident also from the signification of “My voice,” or the Lord’s voice, as being the truths of the Word, of doctrine, and of faith therefrom, thus precepts (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 219, 220, 3563, 6971, 8813, 9926). [2] It is said, if one attends to the Lord’s precepts; which means if one wishes to know truths, and to study them from the Word; this no one can do who is in evils of life, and who has confirmed himself in falsities of doctrine. Those who have confirmed themselves in falsities of doctrine attend to nothing in the Word except what favors the principles of their falsity; other things they either pass by, as if not seen, or pervert and falsify; while those who are in evils of life do not care about truths, and when they hear them do not listen to them.

But those who wish to know truths, and to study them from the Word, are such as are in the spiritual affection of truth; these love truth because it is truth; and those are in that affection who wish to live according to truths from the Word, thus according to the Lord’s commandments. Such are meant by “If anyone hear My voice and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with Me.” 250a. And open the door, signifies reception in the heart or the life. This is evident from the signification of “opening the door,” as being to admit, for “door” signifies admission (see above, n. 208); but here “openIng the door” signifies reception in the heart or the life, for it follows, “I will come in to him.” It is said, “if he open the door,” as if man opened it, when yet it is the Lord Himself who opens, as was said and shown just above (n. 248). It is so said, however, because it so appears to man, by reason of the freedom given him by the Lord. Moreover, in the sense of the letter of the Word many things are said according to appearances; but those appearances are put off in heaven, where the internal or spiritual sense of the Word is. The sense of the letter of the Word is in many places according to appearances, in order that it may serve as a basis for the spiritual sense; otherwise it would have no basis or foundation. That many things in the Word are said according to appearances can be seen from this, that it is said in the Word that evil is from God, that wrath, anger, and revenge pertain to God, and other like things; when yet God does evil to no one, nor does any anger or revenge pertain to Him; for He is good itself and love itself; but because such is the appearance when man does evil and is punished, it is so said in the sense of the letter; but still in the spiritual sense of the Word the meaning is different. So is it with this “if man open the door.” [2] It shall moreover be explained what is meant by “opening the door,” when this is said to be done by man, as here. The Lord is always present with good and truth in man, and strives to open his spiritual mind; this is the door which the Lord wishes to open, and to endow man with heavenly love and faith; for He says, “I stand at"

It is sufficient then for man to acknowledge from the doctrine of the church that all good is from God, and nothing thereof from man. This is not perceived by man, in order that there may be reception by man, and by reception appropriation, for otherwise man cannot be reformed. [3] This shows how much in error those in the doctrine of faith alone are in saying and believing that it is faith and not the good of life that saves, that is, that man is justified by faith alone, thus excluding man’s application to receive. They know that man must examine himself, must see and acknowledge his evils, not only those of his works but also those of thought and intention, and that he must afterwards abstain from them and shun them and lead a new life, which must be a life of good; and that unless he does this there is no forgiveness for him, but damnation. This the doctors and leaders of the church teach when they preach from the Word, and this they teach everyone who comes to the Holy Supper; this they then teach as if from faith; but as soon as they go back and look to their doctrine of justification by faith alone they no longer believe these things, but say that all are led from evil to good by God after they have received faith; and some of them, that they may connect their principles of falsity with truths, say that after they have been justified by faith they are led by God to examine themselves, to confess their sins before God, to abstain from them, and so on. This, however, takes place with no one who believes in justification by faith alone, but it does take place with those who live a life of charity. By that life man is conjoined with heaven, but no man is so by faith alone. He who is conjoined with heaven by a life of charity is led by the Lord to see his evils, beth the evils of thought and the evils of will. Man sees evils from good, because evils are contrary to good. But he who believes in salvation by faith alone says in heart, “I have faith, since I believe the things that are said; nothing condemns me; I have been justified;” and one who so believes can in no way be led by the Lord to examine himself and to repent of evils. Thus do they teach truths before the people, who from this believe that living well and believing well are meant by"

The way and means to be received as worthy partakers of that holy table is, first, to examine your lives and conversations by the rule of God’s commandments; and whereinsoever ye shall perceive yourselves to have offended, either by will, word, or deed, there to bewail your own sinfulness, and to confess yourselves to Almighty God, with full purpose of amendment of life. And if ye shall perceive your offenses to be such as are not only against God but also against your neighbors, then ye shall reconcile yourselves unto them; being ready to make restitution and satisfaction according to the uttermost of your power, for all injuries and wrongs done by you to any other; and being likewise ready to forgive others that have offended you, as ye would have forgiveness of your offenses at God’s hand; for otherwise the receiving of the holy communion doth nothing else but increase your damnation. Therefore if any of you be a blasphemer of God, a hinderer or slanderer of His Word, an adulterer, or be in malice or envy, or in any other grievous crime, repent you of your sins, or else come not to that holy table; lest after the taking of that holy sacrament the devil enter into you, as he entered into Judas, and fill you full of iniquities, and bring you to destruction both of body and soul.

The former way they call practical religion, but the latter the Christian religion; the former they believe to be for the simple, but the latter for the wise. But I am able to affirm that those who live according to the doctrine of faith alone and of justification by faith have no spiritual faith at all, and after the life in this world they come into damnation. But those who live according to the doctrine drawn from the above exhortations have spiritual faith, and after the life in the world come into heaven. This also perfectly agrees with the faith received throughout the Christian world, called the Athanasian Faith, in which are these words respecting the Lord: At whose coming all men shall give account for their own works. And they that have done good shall go into life everlasting; and they that have done evil into everlasting fire; this is the catholic faith.

That in the last time of the church there would be no faith in the Lord because no charity, was signified by: Peter’s denying the Lord thrice before the cock crew (Matt. 26:34, 69–74). The like is signified by: The Lord’s saying to Peter, when Peter saw John following the Lord, What is that to thee, Peter? Follow thou Me, John; for Peter had said of John, What of this man? (John 21:21, 22). For “Peter” in a representative sense signifies faith, and “John” the good of charity; and because John signified the good of charity, therefore he reclined on the Lord’s breast (John 21:20). [8] That this good is what makes the church is signified by the Lord’s words from the cross to John: Jesus saw His mother, and the disciple whom He loved standing by; and He said unto His mother, Woman, behold thy son! And He said to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And from that hour that disciple took her unto himself (John 19:26, 27). “Mother” and “woman” here mean the church; and “John” the good of charity, and thus these words signify that the church will be where there is the good of charity.

[9] From what has now been presented let it be considered whether having faith is anything else than living it; and whether living it is not merely knowing and thinking, but also willing and doing; for faith is not in man when it is only in his knowing and thinking, but when it is also in his willing and doing. Faith in man is the faith of the life, but faith not yet in man is the faith of the memory and of thought therefrom. The faith of the life means believing in God; but believing those things that are from God, and not believing in God, is historical faith, which is not saving. Who that is a true priest and good pastor does not wish that men should live aright; and who does not know that the faith of knowledges, based on what another has said, is not the faith of the life, but historical faith? [10] Faith of the life is the faith of charity, for charity is life. But even though this be so, still I foresee that those who have confirmed themselves in the doctrine of faith alone and of justification by faith will not recede from it, because they connect falsities with truths; for they teach truths when they teach from the Word, but falsities when they teach from doctrine; and they therefore confound these things by saying that the fruits of faith are the goods of life, and that these follow from faith, and yet that the goods of life contribute nothing to salvation, but that faith alone saves. Thus they both join and separate the two; and when they join the two they teach truths, but only before the people, who do not know that they are inverting things, and that they say these things of necessity, in order that their doctrine may cohere with the Word; but when they separate the two they teach falsities, for they say that faith saves, and not the goods of charity which are works, not knowing then that charity and faith act as one, and that charity"

I will come in to him, signifies conjunction. This is evident from the signification of “coming in,” as being, in reference to the Lord, to be conjoined with Him (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 3914, 3918, 6782, 6783). The Lord is conjoined with those who receive Him in heart and life, because the Lord enters or flows in into life; He enters or flows in only with those who are in a life of spiritual love, or in a life of charity; for charity is spiritual love. When that love makes a man’s life, the Lord enters or flows in through it into the truths of faith, and causes man to see, or to know them; from this man has the spiritual affection of truth. It is a great mistake to suppose that the Lord enters or flows in into faith alone or into faith separate from charity with man; in such a faith there is no life, for it is like the breathing of the lungs without the inflow from the heart, which breathing would be only a lifeless movement, for the breathing of the lungs is made alive by the inflow from the heart, as is well known. This makes clear by what way the Divine proceeding from the Lord is admitted, namely, by the way of the heart, that is, of the love; whether you say the heart or the love, it is the same as the life of the spirit therefrom. Love makes man’s life, as anyone may know and see if he is only willing to give thought to it; for what is a man without love? is he not a stock? Therefore, as the love is so is the man. Love is willing and doing, for what man loves he wills and does. An idea of the good of charity and of the truth of faith may be formed from the sun’s light and heat. When the light that proceeds from the sun is conjoined with heat, as in spring and summer time, then all things of the earth bud and blossom; but when there is no heat in the light, as in winter time, then all things of the earth become torpid and die. Spiritual light also is the truth of faith, and spiritual heat is the good of charity. From this an idea may be formed of the man of the church; that when faith with him is conjoined to charity he is like a garden and a paradise; but when"

This is evident from the signification of “supping,” as being to communicate the goods of heaven. “To sup” means to communicate, because “banquets,” “feasts,” “dinners,” and “suppers” in the Word signify consociations by love, and thus a communication of love’s delights, for all delights are of love. These things derive their signification from that of bread and of wine, which signify the good of love, celestial and spiritual; and from that of eating together, which signifies communication and appropriation. This was formerly signified by the paschal supper, and is at this day signified by the holy supper (see above, n. 146; and in the Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, n. 210–222). Mention is made of “supping,” because weddings were celebrated at supper time, and weddings signify the conjunction of good and truth, and the consequent communication of delights. It is therefore said in Revelation: Blessed are they which are called to the marriage supper of the Lamb (19:9); Come and be gathered together unto the supper of the great God (verse 17).

Therefore, being angry, be ordered his servant to bring in the poor, the maimed, the halt, and the blind; saying of those called, that none of them should taste of the supper (14:16–24).

[3] In the Word it is said in many places that in heaven they will “eat together;” and this means in the spiritual sense that they are to enjoy blessedness and felicity; thus “eating together” has here a like significance as “supping.” Thus in Luke: They shall come from the east and the west, and from the north and the south, and shall recline to eat in the kingdom of God (13:29). And in Matthew: Many shall come from the east and the west, and shall recline to eat with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of the heavens (8:11).

(That the “four quarters” in the Word have such a signification, may be seen in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 141–153; that “Abraham. Isaac, and Jacob,” mean the Lord in respect to the Divine Itself and the Divine Human, Arcana Coelestia, n. 1893, 4615, 6098, 6185, 6276, 6804, 6847; consequently “to recline to eat with them” means to be conjoined with the Lord, and to be consociated one to another by love, and"

[5] In the same: Ye are they which have continued with Me in My temptations; I appoint unto you, even as My Father hath appointed unto Me, a kingdom, that ye may eat and drink at My table in the kingdom (22:28–30). “To eat and drink at the Lord’s table in the kingdom of God” is to be conjoined to the Lord by love and faith, and to enjoy heavenly blessedness. [6] In Matthew: Jesus said, I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this product of the vine, until that day when I will drink it new with you in My Father’s kingdom (26:29). These words were spoken by the Lord after He instituted the Holy Supper; and “the product of the vine” signifies Divine truth from Divine good, and blessedness and felicity therefrom."

(That “fat things” signify the goods of love, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 353, 5943, 10033; and also the delights of love, n. 6409; and that “wine” signifies the good of charity, which in its essence is truth, n. 1071, 1798, 6377.) 252b. [8] The “wedding to which the ten virgins were invited” has a like meaning, of which in Matthew: The kingdom of the heavens is like unto ten virgins, who took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom. And five of them were prudent, and five were foolish. The foolish, when they took their lamps, took no oil with then; but the prudent took oil in their vessels with their lamps. Now while the bridegroom tarried they all slumbered and slept. But at midnight a cry arose, Behold the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him. Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps. And the foolish said unto the prudent, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are going out. But the prudent answered, saying, Peradventure there will not be enough for us and you; go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves. And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the wedding, and the door was shut. Afterward came the other virgins, saying, lord, lord, open to us. But he answered and said, Verily I say to you, I know you not (25:1–12). This treats of conjunction with the Lord by love and faith; this the “wedding” moreover signifies; “oil” signifies the good of love, and “lamps” the truth of faith. To make clear that in every particular that the Lord spoke there is a spiritual sense, I will lay open the particulars of the spiritual sense of this parable. “The kingdom of the heavens,” to which the ten virgins are likened, means heaven and the church; “the ten virgins” signify all who are of the church (”ten” all, and “virgins” those who are in the affection of spiritual truth and good, which affection constitutes the church), therefore"

From this it is clear what is signified by “the prudent virgins” going in to the marriage, and that the foolish who said, “Lord, Lord, open to us,” received for answer, “Verily I say unto you, I know you not.” “I know you not” signifies that the Lord was not conjoined to them, since spiritual love conjoins, and not faith without love; for the Lord has His abode with those who are in love, and in faith therefrom, and these He knows because He Himself is there. 253a. Verse 21. He that overcometh, I will give to him to sit with Me in My throne, signifies that he who is steadfast to the end of life shall be conjoined with heaven where the Lord is. This is evident from the signification of “overcoming,” as being to be steadfast In the spiritual affection of truth even to the end of life (see above, n. 128); but here it means to be steadfast in a state of faith from charity, since charity is here treated of. This is what “overcoming” means; because so long as man lives in the world he is in combat against the evils and the falsities therefrom that are with him; and he who is in combat, and is steadfast in the faith of charity even to the end of life, overcomes; and he who overcomes in the world overcomes to eternity, since man after death is such as his life had"

This is evident also from the signification of “to sit with Me in My throne,” as being to be conjoined with heaven where the Lord is; for “throne” signifies heaven, and to “sit with Me” signifies to be together with the Lord, thus conjoined to Him. [2] In the Word the word “throne” is many times used, and in reference to the Lord it signifies in general, heaven, in particular the spiritual heaven, and in the abstract, Divine truth proceeding from the Lord, since this is what makes heaven. For this reason “throne” is also predicated of judgment, since all judgment is effected from truths. That such is the signification of “throne” in the Word can be seen from the following passages. In Isaiah: Jehovah said, The heavens are My throne (66:1). In David: Jehovah hath established His throne in the heavens (Ps. 103:19). And in Matthew: He that sweareth by heaven sweareth by the throne of God and by Him that sitteth thereon (23:22). It is clear that “throne” in these passages signifies heaven; for it is said that “the heavens are His throne,” that “He hath established His throne in the heavens,” and that “he who sweareth by heaven sweareth by the throne of God;” not because Jehovah or the Lord there sits upon a throne, but because His Divine in the heavens is called “throne,” and also appears at times as a throne to those to whom it is given to look into heaven. That the Lord was thus seen is evident in Isaiah: I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up, and His train filling the temple (6:1). “His train filling the temple” signifies that Divine truth proceeding filled the ultimate of heaven and the church, for the “Lord’s train”"

The “throne” had an appearance like a sapphire stone, because “sapphire” signified Divine truth proceeding from the Lord’s Divine good, and therefore spiritual truth pellucid from celestial good (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 9407, 9873); thus “throne” here signifies the whole heaven, for heaven is heaven from Divine truth.

There is a like meaning in the following from Revelation: A pure river and bright as crystal went forth out of the throne of God and of the Lamb (22:1). “A pure river and bright as crystal” was seen “going forth out of the throne,” because a “river” as well as “crystal” signifies Divine truth.

And in Isaiah: Unto us a child is born, unto as a Son is given, and the government shall be upon His shoulder, and His name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, God, Hero, Father of Eternity, Prince of Peace. Of the multiplication of His government and peace there shall be no end; upon the throne of David, and upon His kingdom, to establish it in judgment and in righteousness, from henceforth and even to eternity (9:6, 7). It is clear that here is not meant David, and his throne, on which the Lord was to sit; for the Lord’s kingdom was not on earth but in heaven; by “the throne of David,” therefore, heaven in respect to Divine truth is meant (see above, n. 205). The meaning is similar in the Psalm of David, where the Lord speaks of His throne and His kingdom; as in the whole of Psalm 89, in which are also these words: I have sworn unto David My servant: Thy seed will I establish for ever; and thy throne to generation and generation. Judgment and righteousness are the foundation of thy throne: will establish his throne as the days of the heavens (verses 3, 4, 14, 29). That the Lord is here meant by David, see above n. 205).

From this it is clear how these words are to be understood in Jeremiah: At that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of Jehov ah, and all the nations shall be gathered unto it (3:17). In David: Jerusalem is builded; thither the tribes go up; and there are set thrones for judgment, the thrones of the house of David (Ps. 122:3–5). In Ezekiel: The glory of Jehovah came into the house by the way of the gate whose face was toward the east.

In Revelation: The four and twenty elders who are before the throne of God, sitting upon their thrones (11:16). I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them (20:4). In Matthew: Ye who have followed Me in the regeneration, when the Son of man shall sit upon the throne of His glory, ye also shall sit upon thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel (19:28; Luke 22:30). Here “thrones” mean Divine truths, according to which and from which all are to be judged; “twelve” and “twenty-four” signify all things and are predicated of truths; “elders,” and “disciples” also, likewise “tribes,” signify Divine truths. When this is known, what is meant by “thrones” in the above passages can be seen; as also what is meant by “throne” in these words now treated of. “He that overcometh will I give to him to sit with Me in My throne.” (That “twelve” signifies all, and that it is predicated of truths, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 577, 2089, 2129, 2130, 3272, 3858, 3913; likewise “twenty-four” because that number is the double of the number twelve, and arises from it by multiplication, n. 5921, 5335, 5708, 7973.

There were six steps to the throne; the head of the throne was round; and behind it were hands on either side near the place of the seat, and two lions standing near the hands; and there were twelve lions standing upon the six steps on the one side and on the other; there was not the like made in any kingdom (10:18-20). Here “ivory” signifies Divine truth in ultimates; “the head being round,” the corresponding good; “the gold with which it was overlaid” Divine good from which is Divine truth. “The six steps” signify all things from first to last; “the two hands” all power; “lions,” the truths of the church in their power; “twelve,” all things. As “throne,” in reference to the Lord, signifies heaven in respect to all Divine truth, so in a contrary sense it signifies hell in respect to all falsity.

As I also have overcome, and sit with My Father in His throne, signifies comparatively as Divine good is united to Divine truth in heaven. This is evident from the signification of “overcoming,” as being in reference to the Lord Himself, to unite Divine good to Divine truth. Because this was effected through temptations and victories, it is said, “as I also have overcome.” (That the Lord united Divine good to Divine truth through temptations admitted into His Human, and then through continued victories, see the Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, n. 201, 293, 302.) “To sit with My Father in His throne” signifies Divine good united to Divine truth in heaven, because “Father,” when said by the Lord, means the Divine good that was in Him from conception, and “Son” the Divine truth, both in heaven, “throne” meaning heaven (see above). This Divine of the Lord in the heavens is called Divine truth, but it is Divine good united to Divine truth. (That this is so, see in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 13, 133, 139, 140.)"

If ye know these things, blessed are ye if ye do them (13:16, 17). So in other places the Lord compares Himself with others; for example, in John: Jesus said, Even as the Father hath loved Me, so have I loved you; abide ye in My love, as I have kept My Father’s commandments, and abide in His love (15:9, 10). They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. As Thou didst send Me into the world, even so sent I them into the world (17:16, 18). As the Father hath sent Me, even so send I you (20:21). The glory which Thou hast given Me I have given unto them; that they may be one even as we are one, I in them, Thou in Me.

The Lord spoke of His conjunction with men in the same way as He spoke of His conjunction with the Father, that is, the conjunction of His Human with the Divine that was in Him, for the reason that the Lord is not conjoined with what is man’s own (proprio), but with His own that is with man. The Lord removes what is man’s own (proprium), and gives of His own, and dwells in that.

(See also John 6:56. But these things may be better understood from what is shown in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 11, 12.) From this it follows that as the Divine of the Lord received by angels and by men makes heaven and the church with them, they are one with the Lord, as He and the Father are one. [3] That the meaning of these words of the Lord, that “He sitteth with His Father in His throne,” may be more clearly seen, it must be known that “God’s throne” is heaven (as was shown in the preceding article), and that heaven is heaven from the Divine that proceeds from the Lord, and this Divine is called Divine truth, but is Divine good united to Divine truth (as was said above). The Lord Himself is not in heaven, but is above the heavens, and is seen by those who are in the heavens as a sun. He is seen as a sun because He is Divine love, and Divine love is seen by the angels as solar fire; this is why “sacred fire” in the Word signifies love Divine. From the Lord as a sun light and heat proceed; the light that proceeds, since it is spiritual light, is Divine truth; and the heat, since it is spiritual heat, is Divine good. This, namely, the Divine good, is what is meant by “the Father in the heavens.” (That the Lord is the Sun of Heaven, and that the light and heat therefrom are Divine truth united to Divine good, may he seen in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 116–125, 126–140; and that Heaven is Heaven from the Divine that proceeds from the Lord, n. 7–12.) From this what is meant in the Word by “the Father in the heavens” and by “Heavenly Father” can be seen. Thus in Matthew: Do good to your enemies, that ye may be sons of your Father who is in the heavens (5:44, 45). Ye shall be perfect, as your Father in the heavens is perfect (verse 48)."

The same can be seen from this passage in Matthew: Call no man your Father on the earth, for one is your Father who is in the heavens (23:9). It is plain that no one is forbidden to call his father on the earth “father,” nor is this here forbidden by the Lord; but this was said because “Father” means the Divine good, and: No one is good except the one God (Matt. 19:17).

That the things written to these seven churches mean all who are of the church, or all things of the church, can be seen also from the explanation of all the things written to them. For all things of the church have reference to these four generals, namely, doctrine, a life according to doctrine, faith according to life; these three are treated of in what is written to six of the churches; doctrine, in what is written to the churches in Ephesus and Smyrna; a life according to doctrine, in what is written to the churches in Thyatira and Sardis; and faith according to life, in what is written to the churches in Philadelphia and Laodicea; and since doctrine cannot be implanted in the life and come to be of faith unless man combats against the evils and falsities, which he has by heredity, that combat also is treated of in what is written to the church in Pergamos; for there temptations are treated of, and temptations are combats against evils and falsities.

Spiritual affection or love is charity; it is evident, therefore, that no one can ever enter heaven if he is not in charity. 257. Since in this prophetical book numbers are often mentioned, and no one can know the spiritual sense of the things contained therein unless it is known what the particular numbers signify (for all numbers in the Word, like all names, signify spiritual things), and since the number “seven” is often mentioned among others, I win here show that “seven” signified all persons and all things, likewise fullness and totality; for that which signifies all persons and all things signifies also fullness and totality, for fullness and totality are predicated of the magnitude of a thing, and all persons and all things are predicated of multitude. That “seven” has such a signification can be seen from the following passages. in Ezekiel: They that dwell in the cities of Israel shall set fire to and burn the arms, and the shield, and the buckler, with the bow and with the arrows, and the hand-staff, and the spear; and they shall make a fire with them seven years. And they shall bury Gog and all his multitude, and they shall cleanse the earth seven months (39:9, 11, 12). Here the desolation of all things in the church is treated of; “those that dwell in the cities of Israel” signify all goods of truth; “to set fire” signifies to consume by evils. “The arms, the shield, the buckler, the bow, the arrows, the hand-staff, the spear,” are all things pertaining to doctrine; “to make a fire with them seven years” means to consume them all and fully by evils. “Gog” signifies those who are in external worship and in no internal worship; “to bury them and cleanse the earth” means to destroy all such, and completely purge the church of them.

She that hath borne seven shall languish, she shall breathe out her soul (15:8, 9). “The widows,” that shall be multiplied, signify those who are in good and who long for truths, and in a contrary sense, as here, those who are in evil and desire falsities; “the mother of the youths” signifies the church; “the waster at noonday” signifies the vastation of that church, however much it may be in truths from the Word; “she that hath borne seven shall languish, she shall breathe out her soul,” signifies that the church, to which all truths were given because the Word was given to it, is to perish; for “she that hath borne seven” signifies to whom all truths were given. This was particularly said of the Jews. [3] Likewise in the first book of Samuel: They that were hungry have ceased; the barren hath borne seven, and she that hath many children hath failed (2:5). “They that were hungry,” who have ceased, are those who long for the truths and goods of the church; “the barren bearing seven” signifies those who are outside of the church, and are ignorant of truths, because they have not the Word, thus the Gentiles, to whom all things win be given; “she that hath many children failing” signifies those who have, from whom win be taken away. In David: Render unto our neighbors sevenfold into their bosom (Ps. 79:12).

But lest it should be understood to mean seven times, the Lord explained his meaning to Peter, who supposed seven times to be meant, in Matthew: Peter said, Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him? until seven times? Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times, but, Until seventy times seven (18:21, 22). “Seventy times seven” means always, without counting. In David: Seven times a day do I praise thee for the judgments of righteousness (Ps. 119:164). “Seven times a day” means always, or at all times. [5] In the same: The sayings of Jehovah are pure sayings, as silver refined in a crucible purified seven times (Ps. 12:6). “Silver” signifies truth from the Divine; “purified seven times” means wholly and fully pure. [6] in Isaiah: The light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days (30:26). “The light of the sun” signifies Divine truth from Divine good; that “this light shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days,”"

Here profanation is treated of, and “the seven unclean spirits” with which the unclean spirit would return, signify all the falsities of evil, thus a complete destruction of good and truth.

[9] Because “seven” and “seven times” signified all things and fullness, the following commands were given: Seven days the hands [of Aaron and his sons] should be filled (Exod. 29:35).

EXPOSITION 258. It was pointed out above (n. 5) that this prophetical book does not treat of the successive states of the Christian Church from its beginning to its end, as has been believed theretofore, but of the state of the church and of heaven in the last times, when there is to he a new heaven and a new earth, that is, when there is to be a new church in the heavens and on the earth, thus when there is to be a judgment. It is said a new church in the heavens, because the church is there as well as on the earth (see in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 221–227). As this is the subject of this book, the first chapter treats of the Lord who is the Judge; and the second and third chapters treat of those who are of the church and of those who are not of the church, thus of those in the former heaven which was to be done away with, and of those in the new heaven which was to be formed. That the seven churches treated of in the second and third chapters mean all who are in the church, and also all things of the church, see above (n. 256, 257). This fourth chapter now treats of the arrangement of all things, especially in the heavens, before the judgment; therefore a throne was now seen in heaven, and round about four and twenty thrones upon which were four and twenty elders; so also four animals were near the throne, which were cherubim. That these things described the arrangement of all things before the judgment and for judgment win be seen by the examination of this chapter. Be it known, that before any change takes place all things must be prearranged and prepared for the coming event; for all things are foreseen by the Lord, and I disposed and provided for according to what is foreseen. A “throne,” therefore, in the midst of heaven means judgment, and “He that sat upon it,” the Lord; the “four and twenty thrones upon which were four and twenty elders,” mean all truths in the complex, by which and according to which is judgment; “the four animals,” which are the cherubim, mean the Lord’s Divine Providence that the former heavens should not suffer injury"

Verse 1. After these things I saw, signifies the understanding illustrated. This is evident from the signification of “to see” as being to understand. “To see” signifies to understand because the sight of the eye corresponds to the sight of the mind, which is understanding. That correspondence is from this, that as the understanding sees spiritual things so the sight of the eye sees natural things. Spiritual things are truths from good, and natural things are objects in various forms. Truths from good, which are spiritual things, are seen in heaven as distinctly as objects before the eye, yet with much difference; for these truths are seen intellectually, that is, they are perceived; and the nature of this eight or perception cannot be described by human words; it can be apprehended only so far as this, that it has in it consent and confirmation from the inmost that so it is. There are, indeed, confirming reasons in very great abundance, which present themselves to the intellectual sight as a one, and this one is as it were a conclusion from many particulars. These confirming reasons are in the light of heaven, which is Divine truth or Divine wisdom proceeding from the Lord, and which operate in each angel"

Since with angels this sight operates upon the sight of the eyes, and presents the truths of the understanding in correspondent forms that appear in heaven not unlike the forms in the natural world that are called objects, so “to see,” in the sense of the letter of the Word, signifies to understand. (What the appearances in heaven are, and that they correspond to the objects of the interior sight of the angels, see in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 170–176.) [2] The expression “to see,” and not tn understand, is used in the Word be cause the Word in its ultimates is natural, and the natural is the basis on which spiritual things have their foundation; consequently if the Word were spiritual in the letter it would have no basis, thus it would be like a house without a foundation. (On this, also see in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 303–310.) That in the Word “to see” signifies to understand, is evident from the following passages. In Isaiah: Who said to the seers, See not; and to those that have vision, See not for us right things; speak to us smooth things, see illusions (30:10). The eyes of them that see shall not be closed, and the ears of them that hear shall hearken (32:3). Look, ye blind, that ye may behold, seeing great things ye do not keep them (42:18, 20). The priest and the prophet err among the seeing, they stumble in judgment (27:7). And in other places: Seeing they see not, and hearing they hear not (Matt. 13:1–15; Mark 4:11, 12; 8:17, 18; Isa. 6:9, 10; Ezek. 12:2);"

And behold a door opened in heaven, signifies the arcana of heaven revealed. This is evident from the signification of “door,” as meaning admission (of which above, n. 208), here, a looking into, which is admission of the sight; moreover, the sight is admitted into heaven where the sight of the bodily eyes is dimmed, and at the same time the sight of the spirit’s eyes is enlightened. By this sight all things seen by the prophets were seen. A “door opened in heaven” here signifies the arcana of heaven revealed, because at such a time things that are in the heavens appear; and before the prophets the things that are arcana of the church appear; here arcana respecting the things that were to take place upon the time of the Last Judgment, none of which have been revealed as yet, and which could not be revealed until the judgment was accomplished, and then only through some one in the world to whom it was granted by the Lord to see them, and to whom was revealed at the same time the spiritual sense of the Word. For all things written in this prophetic book were written respecting the Last Judgment, but by means of representatives and correspondences; for whatever is said by the Lord and is perceived by angels, in coming down is changed into representatives, and is so made to appear before the eyes of angels in the ultimate heavens and before prophetic men when the eyes of their spirit have been opened. From this it can be seen what is meant by “a door opened in heaven.” 261. And the first voice that I heard, signifies revelation now of things to come. This is evident from the signification of “voice,” as being whatever proceeds from the Lord and is perceived by angels and by men; here especially revelation of things to come, that were to occur before the Last Judgment, about the time of it, and after it, since these are treated of in what now follows. That “the voice of Jehovah” in the Word signifies the Divine proceeding which is Divine truth, from which is all intelligence and wisdom (see A.C."

The voice of Jehovah breaketh the cedars. The voice of Jehovah hewing as a flame of fire. The voice of Jehovah maketh the wilderness to shiver. the voice of Jehovah maketh the hinds to travail; and in His temple everyone saith: Glory (Ps. 29:3–9). This Psalm treats of the Divine that proceeds from the Lord, and that is called, in a word, Divine truth. Its effect both with the good and with the evil is described in this passage; from which it is evident what is meant by “the voice of Jehovah.” [2] in John: He is the Shepherd of the sheep; to Him the porter openeth, and the sheep hear His voice. A stranger they do not follow, for they know not the voice of strangers. And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold; them also I must bring, and they shall hear My voice. But ye are not of My sheep, for My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me (10:2–5, 16, 26, 27). “Sheep” in the Word mean those who are in truths from good, thus who are in faith from charity; “voice” here means not a voice but the Divine proceeding, which is Divine truth. This flows in with those who are in the good of charity, and gives them intelligence, and so far as they are in good gives them wisdom; intelligence is of truth, and wisdom is of truth from good.

A voice that is heard out of heaven with those who are in the spirit is heard usually as a human voice; but it was heard “as a trumpet speaking” because it was clearly and manifestly perceived by the angels, and what is clearly and manifestly perceived by them falls loudly into the hearing of the spirit; and this was done with John that his attention might be awakened, and thence his sight, lest anything should be obscure to him. This is meant by “the voice of a trumpet” in other places also (Matt. 24:31; Zech. 9:14; Ps. 47:5; Rev. 8:2, 7, 8, 13; 9:1, 13, 14; 10:7; 18:22; and elsewhere). 263.

It also means attention, because when the mind is elevated, attention is awakened. For in respect to thought and win, man has interiors and exteriors; the interiors pertain to the internal man, the exteriors to the external man. The interiors, which pertain to the internal man, are in the spiritual world, consequently the things there are spiritual; but the exteriors, which pertain to the external man, are in the natural world, and the things there are natural. As the latter things are exterior and the former interior, therefore “coming up” signifies elevation towards the interiors, or elevation of mind.

The building of the wall [of the holy Jerusalem] was of jasper, and the city was pure gold, like unto pure glass (21:18). The “wall” of the holy Jerusalem is said to be “of jasper,” because “wall” signifies Divine truth guarding; and because of this signification of “wall,” the first stone of its foundation is said to be jasper (verse 19), “foundation” signifying the truth upon which the church is founded."

This is the stone that is called “pyropus” [firestone], and since it shines as by fire, both names signify the translucency of truth from good. (That all precious stones signify the truths from good of heaven and of the church, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 114, 9863, 9865, 9868, 9873; for this reason twelve precious stones were set in the breastplate of Aaron, which is called the Urim and Thummim, and by them responses were given, and this by their shining forth, and at the same time by a perception as to the thing interrogated or by a living voice, n. 9905.) 269. And a rainbow was round about the throne in aspect like an emerald, signifies the appearance of Divine truth in the heavens about the Lord. This is evident from the signification of “a rainbow in aspect like an emerald,” as denoting the appearance of Divine truth in its circumference; for “a rainbow round about the throne” signifies Divine truth round about; “in aspect like” signifies appearance. The appearance was like an emerald, because it had reference to the Last Judgment; for the color of this stone is green, and “green” signifies truth obscured. Divine truth in its brightness appears either of the color of heaven, or in various colors in beautiful order like a rainbow; but when obscured it appears of the color of an emerald. The heaven that was obscured was the heaven called “the former heaven,” on which judgment was to be executed, and which was about to parish (see Rev. 21:1). On this account “a rainbow round about like an emerald” is mentioned. “Rainbow” signifies Divine truth in the heavens in its order and consequently in its beauty, because there are infinite varieties of truth from good in the heavens, and when these are represented by colors, they present the aspect of a most beautiful rainbow. For this reason “a rainbow” was made the sign of the covenant after the flood (Gen. 9:12–17).

Verse 4. And around the throne were four and twenty thrones, and upon the thrones I saw four and twenty elders sitting, signifies all truths from good in the higher heavens, arranged by the Lord before judgment. This is evident from the signification of “throne” on which was “One sitting,” as being the Lord in respect to the Last Judgment (on which see just above, n. 267; and that “throne” signifies judgment, see n. 253a). Also from the signification of “the four and twenty thrones around it, and four and twenty elders on them,” as being all the truths of heaven in the complex, arranged before judgment. “Four and twenty” signifies all, “thrones” judgment, and “elders” those who are in truths from good, and abstractly truths from good. The higher heavens are here meant, because all who are in them are in truths from the good of love, and because the lower heavens are treated of in what immediately follows. (”Twenty-four” signifies all, because that number signifies the like with the number “twelve,” and “twelve” signifies all, and is predicated of truths, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 577, 2089, 2129, 2130, 3272, 3858, 3913. The number “twenty-four” signifies the like with the number “twelve,” because it is the double thereof, and the double of a number signifies something similar as the number from which it arises by multiplication, as may be seen, n. 5291, 5335, 5708, 7973.) [2] The like is signified by “the thrones upon which the twelve apostles were to sit,” of which in Matthew: Ye who have followed Me in the regeneration, when the Son of man shall sit on the throne of His glory, ye also shall sit upon thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel (19:28; Luke 22:30); the “twelve apostles” signifying all truths in the complex.

He who supposes that “elders” and “apostles” in the Word mean elders and apostles is much mistaken; in the spiritual sense of the Word no persons are perceived, but things abstractly from persons, for what is spiritual has nothing in common with persons. It is otherwise in the sense of the letter of the Word, which is natural; in that sense not only are persons mentioned, but the idea of person is implied in many expressions, in order that the Word in its ultimates may be natural, and thus be a basis for the spiritual sense. It is the same with the signification of “elders” as with that of “infants,” “children,” “young men,” “old men,” “virgins,” “women,” and many words of that kind; in the natural sense these are all thought of simply as persons; but in the spiritual sense “infants” mean innocence, “children” charity, “young men” intelligence, “old men” wisdom, “virgins” the affection of truth and good, and “women” the goods of the church; and so in other cases. The same is true of the natural and spiritual senses of “neighbor;” in the natural sense “neighbor” means any man whatever; but in the spiritual sense the good, truth, sincerity, and justice itself that are in the person. Everyone who reflects can see that this is the neighbor in the spiritual sense; for who loves a person for any other reason? For good and truth make the man, and cause him to be loved, and not the countenance and body. [3] But to return to the signification of “elders.” That “elders” signify truths from good can be seen from the passages in the Word where they are mentioned. In Isaiah: Then the moon shall blush, and the sun be ashamed, and Jehovah of Hosts shall reign in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem; and before His elders shall be glory (24:23). The “moon” and “sun” mean their idolatrous worship and the falsity of faith and the evil of love; “Mount Zion” and “Jerusalem”"

This is what the seventy elders of Israel represented, and what the “four and twenty elders” sitting upon as many thrones signified; this also is what the “twelve apostles” signify, of whom it is said that “they are to sit upon thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.” (That the “twelve apostles” signify all truths from good, Arcana Coelestia, n. 2129, 3354, 3488, 3858, 6397; that the “twelve tribes of Israel” have a like signification, n. 3858, 3926, 4060, 6335; likewise the “elders of Israel,” n. 6524, 6525, 6890, 7912, 8578, 8585, 9376, 9404.) 271.

That “white garments” signify the lower heavens may seem strange to those who know nothing about appearances and representatives in heaven. All in the heavens are clothed according to truths, and lower truths correspond to garments, and because the lower heavens are in these truths, therefore the garments of the angels in the higher heavens also correspond to these. (But this arcanum may be more clearly understood from what is said and shown respecting the garments in which the angels are clothed, in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 177–182; likewise from what was represented and signified by the garments of Aaron and his sons, explained in Arcana Coelestia, n. 9814, 10068; as also by the garments of the Lord when He was transfigured, n. 9212, 9216.)"

All the truths of heaven and of the church are from Divine good; truths that are not therefrom are not truths. Truths that are not from good are like shells without a kernel, and like a house in which no man dwells, but a wild beast; such are the truths that are called truths of faith apart from the good of charity; the good of charity is good from the Lord, thus Divine good. Now as “the elders upon thrones” signify the truths of the heavens, and “golden crowns” the good from which these are, therefore the elders were seen with crowns. The “crowns of kings” have a like signification; for “kings” in a representative sense signify truths, and “crowns” upon their heads signify the good from which the truths are (that “kings” signify truths may be seen above, n. 31a). For this reason the crowns are of gold, for “gold” in like manner signifies good (see above. n. 242a, d, e).

In David: I win make the horn to spring forth for David; I win set in order a lamp for Mine anointed; his enemies win I clothe with shame; but upon himself shall his crown blossom (Ps. 132:17, 18). Here “David” and “anointed” mean the Lord (see above, n. 205); “horn” His power; “lamp” is the Divine truth from which is Divine intelligence; “Crown” the Divine good from which is Divine wisdom, and from which is the Lord’s government; and the “enemies,” that shall be clothed with shame, are evils and falsities.

Here also “anointed” stands for the Lord, and “anger” for a state of temptation, in which He was when in combats with the hells. “Anger” and “condemnation” describe the lamentation at that time, as the Lord’s last lamentation on the cross, that He was forsaken; for the cross was the last of His temptations or combats with the hells; and after that last temptation He put on the Divine good of the Divine love, and thus united the Divine Human to the Divine Itself which was in Him. [4] In Isaiah: In that day shall Jehova h of Hosts be for a crown of adornment, and for a diadem of splendor, unto the remnant of His people (28:5).

[10] Again: Afterwards I saw, and behold a whig cloud; and on the cloud One sat like unto the Son of man, having on His head a golden crown, and in His hand a sharp sickle (14:14); a “white cloud” standing for the literal sense of the Word (Arcana Coelestia, n. 4060, 4391, 5922, 6343, 6752, 8281, 8781); “the Son of man” meaning the Lord in respect to Divine truth; “the golden crown,” the Divine good from which is Divine truth; and “the sharp sickle,” the dispersion of evil and falsity.

But let something first be said in respect to the origin of these significations. All things that appear before the eyes of men in the visible heaven, as the sun, the moon, the stars, the air, the ether, light, beat, clouds, mists, showers, and may more, are correspondences; they are correspondences for the reason that all things in the natural world correspond to those in the spiritual world. These are also correspondences in heaven where the angels are, because like things are seen by them but there they are not natural but spiritual (as can be seen from what is shown respecting them in the work on Heaven and Hell, on the sun and moon in heaven, n 116–125; on light and heat in heaven, n. 126–140; and in general, on the correspondence of heaven with all things of the earth, n. 103–115; and on appearances in heaven, n. 170–176) Therefore “lightnings” and “thunders” also are correspondences; and because they are correspondences, they have the like significance as the things have to which they correspond. Their significance in general is Divine truth received and uttered by the highest angels; which, when it descends to the lower angels sometimes appears as lightning, and is heard as thunder with voices. From this it is that “lightning” signifies Divine truth in respect to illustration; “thunder” Divine truth in respect to understanding; and “voices” Divine truth in respect to perception. It is said in respect to the understanding and in respect to the perception, since what enters into the mind through the hearing is both seen and perceived; seen in the understanding, and perceived through communication with the win. (What perception is, strictly, such as the angels in heaven have, may be seen in the Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, n. 140.) [2] From this then it is that “lightnings” and “thunders” in the Word signify Divine truth in respect to illustration and in respect to the understanding, as can be seen from the following passages.

Here the establishment of the church is treated of; “the clouds poured out waters” signifies truths from the sense of the letter of the Word; “the skies gave forth a voice” (that is, the higher clouds), signifies truths from the spiritual sense of the Word; “the arrows that went forth” (meaning thunderbolts, from which there is an appearance as of arrows from a bow and which are present when there are thunders and lightnings) signify Divine truths; “the voice of thunder into the world” signifies Divine truth in respect to perception and understanding in the church; and “the lightnings lightened the world” signifies Divine truth in respect to illustration thence; “the world” signifies the church. [3] In the same: A fire shall go before Jehovah, and bum up His enemies round about; His lightnings shall lighten the world (Ps. 97:3, 4). From these words also it is clear that “lightnings” signify Divine truth in respect to illustration, for it is said “His lightnings shall lighten the world.

Here again the establishment of the church is treated of. That “the voice of thunder” signifies Divine truth in respect to perception and understanding, and “lightnings” Divine truth in respect to illustration, can be seen from its being said, “The Maker of the earth prepareth the world by His wisdom, and by His intelligence"

[5] in the second book of Samuel: Jehovah thundered from heaven, and the Most High gave forth His voice and sent forth His arrows and scattered them, lightning, and discomforted them (22:14, 15). Thunders are here described by “thundering from heaven” and by “giving forth a voice,” flying thunderbolts by “arrows,” and all these signify Divine truths, and “lightning” their light; and as these vivify and illustrate the good, so they terrify and blind the evil, which is meant by “He sent forth arrows and scattered them, lightning, and discomfited them;” for the evil cannot bear Divine truths, nor any light at all from heaven, therefore they See away at their presence. [6] Likewise in David: Jehovah thundered in the heavens, and the Most High gave forth His voice; and He sent forth His arrows and scattered them, and many lightnings and discomfited them (Ps. 18:13, 14).

In Luke: Let your loins be girded about, and your lamps shining (7:35). The “loins” to be girded signify the good of love (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 3021, 4280, 4462, 5050–5052, 9961); and “lamps shining” signify the truths of faith from the good of love.

If, therefore, the light be darkness, how great is the darkness (6:22, 23). The eye is here called “lucerna,” that is, a lighted lamp, because the “eye” signifies the understanding of truth, and therefore the truth of faith; and as the understanding derives its all from the win (for such as the win is, such is the understanding), so the truth of faith derives its all from the good of love; consequently when the understanding of truth is from the good of the win the whole man is spiritual, which is signified by the words, “if the eye be good the whole body is light;” but the contrary is true when the understanding is formed out of the evil of the win; that it is then in mere falsities is signified by the words, “If thine eye be evil the whole body is darkened. If, therefore, the light be darkness, how great is the darkness.” (That “the eye” signifies the understanding, see above, n. 152; and that “darkness” signifies falsities, Arcana Coelestia, n. 1539, 1560, 3340, 4415, 4531, 7655, 7711, 7712.) He who does not know that “eye” signifies the understanding does not apprehend at all the meaning of those words. [4] In Jeremiah: I will take away from them the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the voice of the millstones and the light of the lamp (25:10). “To take away the voice of joy and the voice of gladness” signifies to take away the interior felicity that is from the good of love and the truths of faith; “to take away the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride” signifies to take away all conjunction of good and truth, which makes heaven and the church with man; “to take away the voice of the millstones and the light of the lamp” signifies to take away the doctrine of charity and faith. (What is signified by “millstone” and “grinding,” see Arcana Coelestia, n. 4335, 7750, 9995, 10303.) Likewise in Revelation: And the light of a lamp shall shine no more in Babylon; and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more there (18:23)."

In Matthew: The kingdom of heaven is like ten virgins, who took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom. The five foolish took their lamps, but no oil; but the five prudent took oil also. When, therefore, the bridegroom came, the prudent went in to the wedding, but the foolish were not admitted (25:1–12). “Lamps” here signify the truths of faith, and “oil” the good of love. What the rest of this parable signifies may be seen above (n. 252b), where the particulars are explained. 275a. Verse 6. And in sight of the throne a glassy sea like crystal, signifies the appearance of [Divine ] truth in ultimates where its generals are, and its pellucidity by virtue of the influx of Divine truth united to Divine good in firsts. This is evident from the signification of “in sight of the throne,” as being appearance; also from the signification of “glassy,” as being pellucid. It is also said “like crystal,” that pellucidity 1from the influx of Divine truth united to Divine good in firsts may be described; this is signified by “the seven lamps of fire burning before the throne” (as shown just above, n. 274). in this and what precedes, the state of the whole heaven arranged in order for judgment is described, and its ultimate is meant by “the glassy sea like crystal.” The truth of the ultimate heaven is signified by “a glassy sea,” because “sea” signifies the generals of truth, such truth as exists in the ultimates of heaven, and with man in the natural man, which truth is called knowledge (scientificum). The “sea” signifies such truths because in the sea is the gathering together of waters, and waters” signify truths (see above, n. 71).

But let him know that the truths in the spiritual man, from which those are that are in the natural, are incomparably more numerous; but these truths in the spiritual man do not come to the perception of the natural man until he enters the spiritual world, which is after death; for then man puts off the natural and puts on the spiritual. That this is so can be seen from this fact alone, that angels are in intelligence and wisdom ineffable as compared with man, and yet they are from the human race. (That angels are from the human race, see in the small work on the Last Judgment, n.14–22 and 23–27.)

(On this influx see the Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, n. 277, 278.)

By these representatives the Divine of the Lord in the higher heavens, and His Providence that they be not approached except front the good of love and charity, are described; and in this description are contained all the things that are mentioned in this chapter of Revelation respecting the arrangement of the heavens, and signified by “the throne on which was One sitting in aspect like a jasper stone and a sardius;” also by the “rainbow round about the throne,” by the “lamps of fire burning before the throne,” and the other things which it is not necessary therefore to explain here singly. [3] It shall now be shown merely that “cherubim” in the Word signify the guard and providence of the Lord that the higher heavens be not approached except from the good of love and charity, that lower things may be in order. This is plainly seen by the cherubim placed before the garden of Eden, when man was driven from it, which are thus described in Moses: When Jehovah God had driven out the man, He made to dwell on the east of Eden the cherubim, and the flame of a sword turning hither and thither, to guard the way of the tree of life (Gen. 3:24). What is meant by the “man” and “his wife” in these chapters may be seen explained in the Arcana Coelestia, namely, that “man” here means the most ancient church, which was a celestial church; and the celestial is distinguished from the spiritual church in this, that the celestial church is in the good of love to the Lord, but the spiritual in the good of charity towards the neighbor (see in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 20–28). Of the men who constitute these two churches on the earth the two higher heavens are formed. When, therefore, the celestial church,which was the most ancient and primary church on this earth, declined and began to recede from the good of love, it is said that “cherubim were made to dwell"

From this it is clear that “cherubim” signify guards that these heavens be not approached except through the good of love and charity; for this reason they are also said “to guard the way of the tree of life.” (That the “east” signifies the good of love, see Arcana Coelestia,n. 1250,3708; that “Eden” signifies wisdom therefrom, n. 99,100; that “sword” signifies truth combating against falsity and dispersing it, thus truth protecting, above, n. 73, 131a; that “flame” signifies truth from celestial good, Arcana Coelestia, n. 3222, 6832, 9570; that “the tree of life” signifies the good of love from the Lord and the heavenly joy therefrom, see above, n. 109, 110.) 277b. [4] Because of this signification of “cherubim” two cherubim of solid gold were placed upon the mercy-seat which was upon the ark, thus described in Moses: Thou shalt make cherubim, of solid gold thou shalt make them, from the two ends of the mercy seat; out of the mercy seat thou shalt make the cherubim. And the cherubim shall spread out their wings upwards, covering the mercy seat with their wings; towards the mercy seat shall be the faces of the cherubim.

The “ark” and the “tent” represented the higher heavens; the “ark,” in which was the testimony or law, represented the inmost or third heaven; the “tabernacle,” which was without the veil, the middle or second heaven; the “mercy seat” the hearing and reception of all things of worship which are from the good of love and charity; the “cherubim” guards; and the “gold,” of which they were made the good of love. From this it is also clear that the “two cherubim” represented guards that the higher heavens be not approached except through the good of love and charity.

[5] Because “cherubim” signified those guards: There were cherubim also upon the curtains of the tabernacle and upon the veil (Exod. 26:1, 31). And for the same reason Solomon made in the oracle of the temple cherubim of olive wood, and set them in the midst of the interior house, and overlaid them with gold, and also carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubim, and also the doors (1 Kings 6:23–29, 32–35). The “temple” also signified heaven and the church, and its “oracle” the inmost of heaven and the church. The “olive wood,” of which the cherubim were made, signifies the good of love; likewise the “gold” with which they were overlaid. The “walls” on which the cherubim were engraved, signify the ultimates of heaven and of the church, and the “cherubim” thereon signify guards. The “doors,” on which also there were cherubim, signify entrance into heaven and the church. From this it is clear that “cherubim” signified guards that heaven be not approached except through the good of love and charity. And as “cherubim” signified such guards they also signify the Lord’s Divine Providence, for these guards are from the Lord, and are His Divine Providence. (That the “temple” and the “house of God” signify heaven and the church, see above, n. 220; the “oracle” therefore signifies the inmost of these.

[7] Since Divine truth from Divine good is what protects, therefore the king of Tyre is called a “cherub;” for “king” signifies Divine truth, and “Tyre” knowledges; and therefore the “king of Tyre” signifies intelligence, of whom it is thus written in Ezekiel: Thou, King of Tyre, hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering. Thou cherub, the spreading out of one that protects, I have set thee, on God’s mountain of holiness wast thou; thou hast walked in the midst of the stones of fire.

Because it is the Divine proceeding from the Lord that provides and guards, therefore it is said of the Lord that: He sitteth upon the cherubim (Isa. 37:16; Ps. 18:9, 10; 80:1; 99:1; 1 Sam. 4:4; 2 Sam. 6:2). [9] Since the arrangement of all things for judgment is treated of ia this chapter, the cherubim also are here treated of, that is, the Lord’s guard and providence that the higher heavens be not approached except through the good of love and charity; for unless this had been done before the judgment, the veriest heavens, in which the true angels are, would have been endangered, because those heavens that were about to perish (see Rev. 21:1) were not in the good of love and charity, but only in some truths. For there were there from the Christian world those who were in the doctrine of faith alone, which some had confirmed by a number of passages from the Word, and thus obtained some conjunction with the ultimate heaven; but this conjunction was broken when the heaven called the former heaven (Rev. 21:1) was dissipated; and it was then ordered by the Lord that hereafter no one shall be conjoined with the heavens unless he be in the good of love to the Lord and in charity towards the neighbor. This is what is specifically meant by the things that now follow in this chapter. Whoever, therefore, believes that the heavens can hereafter be approached through the worship and prayers of those who are in faith alone, and not at the same time in the good of charity, are much mistaken. The worship of such is no longer received, nor are their prayers heard, but attention is directed only to their life’s love. Those, therefore, in whom the love of sea and the world rules, no matter in what external worship they may have been, are conjoined to the hells, and are also taken there after death, and not previously to any heaven that is to perish, as was the case hitherto. 278a.

This is evident from the signification of “lion,” as being Divine truth proceeding from the Lord in respect to power and effect (of which in what follows). It means appearance in ultimates, because the cherubim were seen as animals, and this first one like a lion. It is said in ultimates, because that appearance was before John when he was in the spirit, and he saw all things in ultimates, in which Divine celestial and Divine spiritual things are variously represented, now by gardens and paradises, now by palaces and temples, now by rivers and waters, now by living creatures of various kinds, such as lions, camels, horses, oxen, bullocks, sheep, lambs, doves, eagles, and many others. Like things were seen by the prophets through whom the Word was written, in order that the Word in its ultimates, which are the things contained in the sense of the letter, might consist of such things as exist in the world, which might be representations and correspondences of celestial and spiritual things, and thus might serve as a basis and foundation to the spiritual sense. For this reason also the cherubim (which signify the guard and providence of the Lord that the higher heavens be not approached except from the good of love and charity) were seen by John and also by Ezekiel, in respect to their faces, as animals. 278b. Since it is the Lord who guards and provides, and this through Divine truth and Divine good, thus through His Divine wisdom and intelligence, four animals were seen, which were like a lion, a calf, a man, and an eagle; for thus by “lion” Divine truth in respect to power was represented, by “calf” Divine good in respect to protection, by “man” the Divine wisdom, and by “eagle” the Divine intelligence; which four things are included in the Lord’s Divine Providence in its guarding the higher heavens, that they be not approached except from the good of love and charity. [2] That a “lion” signifies Divine truth proceeding from the Lord in respect to power is evident from the passages in the Word in which “lion” is mentioned; as from the following, in Moses: Judah is a lion’s whelp; from the prey, my son, thou are gone up; he couched, he lay down as an old lion; who shall rouse him up?

Here also “lions” signify those who are in power through Divine truth; “their abode” signifies where there are such in the church; their “feeding.place” signifies the knowledges of truth and good; their “walking and none making them afraid” signifies their state of security from evils and falsities.

As a lion among the beasts of the forest, as a young lion among the flocks of sheep, who if he go through shall tread down and tear in pieces so that none delivereth, thine hand shall be lifted up above thine adversaries, and all thine enemies shall be cut off (5:7–9). The “remnant of Jacob” signifies the truths and goods of the church; “dew from Jehovah” signifies spiritual truth; “drops upon the herb” natural truth; “a lion among the beasts of the forest,” and “a young lion among the flocks of sheep,” and “treading down and tearing, and none delivering,” signify power over evils and falsities; because of this signification it is said, “thine hand shall be lifted up above thine adversaries, and all thine enemies shall be cut off;” for “adversaries” signify evils, and “enemies” falsities (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 2851, 8289, 9314, 10481).

(That “chariot” signifies the doctrine of truth, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 2761, 2762, 5321, 8029, 8215; that “horseman” signifies the Word in respect to the understanding, see n. 2761, 6401, 6534, 7024, 8146, 8148.)

These words in David describe the state of the angels of heaven when they are not in a state of intense love and of wisdom therefrom, and when they return into that state; the former state is described by “lions roaring after their prey, and seeking their food from God;” the latter state by “the sun ariseth, they gather themselves together and lie down in their abodes.” By the “lions” the angels of heaven are meant; their “roaring,” means desire; “prey” and “food” mean the good which is of love and the truth which is of wisdom; “the sun arising” means the Lord in respect to love and wisdom therefrom; “gathering themselves together” means returning into a celestial state; and “lying down in their abodes,” a state of tranquility and peace.

[10] Because a “lion” signifies power, therefore in the lamentations of David over Saul and Jonathan it is said: Saul and Jonathan were lovely, they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions (2 Sam. l. 23). “Saul” here as king, and “Jonathan” as the son of a king, mean truth protecting the church, since the doctrine of truth and good is here treated of, for that lamentation was written “to teach the sons of Judah the bow” (verse 18 there); and “bow” signifies that doctrine (see Arcana Coelestia, 2686, 2709, 6422). [11] Because “the kings of Judah and Israel” represented the Lord in respect to Divine truth, and because a “throne” represented the judgment, which is effected according to Divine truth, and because “lions” represented power, guard, and protection against falsities and evils, therefore near the two stays of the throne built by Solomon there were two lions, and twelve lions on the six steps on the one side and on the other (1 Kings 10:18–20). From this it can be seen what “lions” in the Word signify when the Lord, heaven, and the church are treated of. “Lions” in the Word signify also the power of falsity from evil by which the church is destroyed and devastated. As in Jeremiah: The young lions roar against her,1 they give forth their voice, they reduce the land to wasteness (2:15). In Isaiah: A nation whose arrows are sharp, and all his bows bent, the hoofs of his horses are accounted as rock, his roaring like that of a lion, he roareth like a young lion, and he growleth and seizeth the prey (5:28, 29)."

And the second animal like a calf signifies the appearance ia ultimates of Divine good in respect to protection. This is evident from the signification of a “calf,” or “bullock,” as being the good of the natural man, and specifically his good of innocence and charity; and because it is the good of the natural man it also is the good of the lowest heaven, for this heaven is spiritual natural (see in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 29–31); and as this good is there, there is a guard or protection that the higher heavens be not approached except through the good of love and charity; this is why one cherub was like a calf. That this appearance was in ultimates, see just above (n. 278a). A “calf” or “bullock” signifies the good of the natural man, because animals from the herd signified the affections of good and truth in the external or natural man; and those from the flock signified the affections of good and truth in the internal or spiritual man. Those from the flock were lambs, she- goats, sheep, rams, and he-goats; those from the herd were oxen, bullocks, and calves. [2] That “bullocks” and “calves” signify the good of the natural man is evident from the passages of the Word where they are mentioned. First from the description of the feet of the cherubim in Ezekiel: Their foot was straight and the sole of their feet like the sole of a calf’s foot, and they sparkled like the appearance of burnished brass (1:7). Their foot thus appeared “straight” because the cherubim represented the Divine guard of the Lord, and the feet and the soles of the feet represented the same in ultimates or in the spiritual natural heaven and the natural world; for “feet” in general signify the natural; a “straight foot” the natural in respect to good; “the sole of the foot” the ultimate of the natural; “burnished brass” also signifies good in the natural. From this it is clear that good in the natural is signified by a “calf,” and that in this is the ultimate good"

What it is to “pay back the bullocks of the lips” no one can know unless he knows what “bullocks” and what “lips” signify; they mean evidently confession and thanksgiving from a good heart; but it is thus expressed because “bullocks” signify external good, and “lips” doctrine; therefore “paying back the bullocks of the lips” signifies to confess and give thanks from the goods of doctrine.

[6] In Luke: The father said of the prodigal son who returned penitent in heart, Bring forth the first robe and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet; and bring hither the fatted calf and kill it, that we may eat and be glad (15:22, 23). He who is acquainted only with the sense of the letter believes that no deeper meaning is contained in this than appears in that sense, when yet every particular involves heavenly things; as that they should “put on him the first robe,” that they should “put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet,” that they should “bring forth the fatted calf, that they might eat and be merry.” By “the prodigal son” those who are prodigal of spiritual riches, which are the knowledges of truth and good, are meant; “his returning to his father, and his confession that he was not worthy to be called his son,” signifies penitence of heart and humiliation; “the first robe with which he was clothed,” signifies general and primary truths; “the ring on the hand” signifies the conjunction of truth and good in the internal or spiritual man; “the shoes on the feet” signify the same ia the external or natural man, and both signify regeneration; “the fatted calf” signifies the good of love and charity; and “to eat and be glad” signifies consociation and heavenly joy.

What is meant by “the covenant of the calf,” and by “passing between its parts,” no one can know without knowing what a “covenant” signifies, and a “calf,” and its being “cut in twain;” then what is meant by “the princes of Judah and Jerusalem,” by “the royal ministers,” “the priests,” and “the people of the land.” Some heavenly arcanum is evidently meant; and it can be understood when it is known that a “covenant” means conjunction; a “calf” good, a “calf cut in twain” good proceeding from the Lord on the one hand, and good received by man on the other, whence is conjunction; and that “the princes of Judah and of Jerusalem, the royal ministers, the priests, and the people of the land,” mean the goods and truths of the church; and that “to pass between the parts” means to conjoin. When these things are known, the internal sense of these words can be seen, namely, that there was no conjunction by the goods and truths of the church with that nation, but disjunction. [8] Like things are involved in the “covenant of the calf” with Abram, of which in Genesis: Jehovah said to Abram, Take to thee an heifer of three years old, and a she-goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtle dove, and a young pigeon. And he took him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each part over against the other; but the birds divided he not. And the birds of prey came down upon the carcasses; and Abram drove them away. And the sun was at its going down, and a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and lo, a terror of great darkness fell upon him. And in that day Jehovah made a covenant with Abram (15:9–12, 18). The “terror of great darkness” that fell upon Abram signified the state of the Jewish nation, which was in the greatest darkness in respect to the truths and goods of the church. This state of that nation is what is described in the prophet by “the covenant of the calf which they cut into two parts, between which they passed.”"

Since a “calf” signifies the good of the natural man and its truth, which is knowledge; and since the natural man and its knowledge is signified by “Egypt,” therefore in the Word Egypt is called a “she-calf,” and a “he-calf;” moreover, when they applied the knowledges of the church to magical and idolatrous purposes they turned the calf into an idol; this was why the sons of Israel made to themselves a he-calf in the wilderness, and worshiped it, and also why they had a calf in Samaria. [9] That Egypt was called a he-calf and a she-calf can be seen in Jeremiah: A very fair she-calf is Egypt; destruction cometh out of the north, her hirelings in the midst of her are like he-calves of the stall (46:20, 21). Respecting the calf that the sons of Israel made to themselves in the wilderness, see Exodus 32; and respecting the “calf of Samaria” (1 Kings 12:28–32), about which is the following in Hosea: They have made a king, but not by Me; they have made princes, and I knew it not; of their silver and their gold have they made them idols, that they may be cut off. Thy calf, O Samaria, hath forsaken thee. For it was from Israel; the workman made it, and it is not God; the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces (8:4–6). This treats of the corrupt explanation of the Word, when the sense of its letter is turned to favor self-love, and the principiis of religion derived therefrom. “They have made a king, but not by Me, and they have made princes, and I knew it not,” signifies doctrines from self-intelligence, which in themselves are falsities, but which they make to appear as truths; for “king” signifies truth, and in a contrary sense, falsity; “princes” signify primary truths, or falsities, which are called principles of religion. “To make idols of their silver and their gold” signifies to pervert the truths and goods of the church, and still to worship them as holy, although as they are from self-intelligence they are destitute of life; “silver” is the truth, and “gold” the good, which are from the Lord; “idols” signify worship from doctrine that is from self-intelligence; “the workman made it,"

And the third animal had a face like a man, signifies the appearance in ultimates of the Divine guard and providence in respect to wisdom. This is evident from the signification of “the face of a man,” as being the affection of truth, “face” signifying affection, and “man” the recipient of Divine truth; and because man’s rational is from this, “man” signifies wisdom; for man was created that he might be rational and wise; by this he is distinguished from the brute animals; for this reason “man” in the Word signifies wisdom. “Man” signifies both the affection of truth and wisdom, because the affection of truth and wisdom act as one; for he who is in the spiritual affection of truth, that is, who is affected by truth, or who loves truth because it is truth, is conjoined to the Lord, since the Lord is in His own truths, and is His truth with man; from this man has wisdom, and from this it is that man is a man. Some suppose that man is a man by reason of his face and body, and that by these he is distinguished from beasts, but they are in an error; man is a man by reason of his wisdom, consequently so far as anyone is wise so far is he a man. Those, therefore, who are wise, appear in heaven and in the light of heaven as men, with a brightness and beauty according to their wisdom; while those who are not wise—which is true of those who are in no spiritual affection, but merely in natural affection, in which man is when he loves truth not because it is truth but because he thence receives glory, honor, and gain—these in the light of heaven appear not as men but as monsters in various forms (see in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 70, 72, 73–77, 80; and what wisdom is, and what non-wisdom, n. 346–356)."

He said, until cities be devastated that they may be without inhabitant, and the houses that there may be no man in them, and the ground be devastated to a waste. Jehovah shall remove man, and forsaken places shall be multiplied in the midst of the land (6:11, 12). These things were not said of the devastation of the earth, that there should no longer be cities and houses therein, or that in these there should be no inhabitant or man, but they were said of the devastation of good and truth in the church; “cities” signifying the truths of doctrine; “inhabitant” the good of doctrine; “houses” the interiors of man which are of his mind; and “man” the spiritual affection of truth and wisdom therefrom. This is signified by “the houses shall be devastated, that there may be no man in them.” The “land” that shall be devastated to a waste signifies the church. From this it is clear what is signified by “removing man,” and by “multiplying the forsaken places in the midst of the land;” “a forsaken place” signifying where there is no good because there is no truth. [3] In the same: I will make a man more rare than pure gold; even a man than the gold of Ophir (13:12). A “man” (virum hominem) signifies intelligence, and “man” (hominem) wisdom, and that these were about to be at an end is signified by their being “made rare.” Intelligence is distinguished from wisdom by this, that intelligence is the understanding of truth such as the spiritual man has, and wisdom is the understanding of truth such as the celestial man has, whose understanding is from the will of good. From this it is clear what is here signified by “man” (virum hominem), and what by “man” (hominem). [4] In the same:"

This treats of the devastation of the church; “the highways that are laid waste” and “he that passeth through the way who hath ceased” signify that the goods and truths which lead to heaven are no more; “he hath made void the covenant” signifies no conjunction then with the Lord; “he hath rejected the cities” signifies that they spurn doctrine; “he regardeth not man” signifies that he maketh no account of wisdom. [6] In Jeremiah: I saw the earth, when lo, it was void and empty; and towards the heavens, and their light was not.

In that sense “earth” signifies the church; that it was “void and empty” signifies that there is no good and truth in the church; the “heavens,” where there is no light, signify the interiors of man’s mind which are the receptacles of the light of heaven; (the “light” that is not there is Divine truth and wisdom therefrom); therefore"

[8] In Zephaniah: I will take away man and beast; I will take away the fowl of the heavens and the fishes of the sea; I will cut off man from the surfaces of the earth (1:3). “To take away man and beast” means to take away the spiritual affection of truth and the natural affection of truth; “to take away the fowl of the heavens and the fishes of the sea” means to take away spiritual truths and natural truths; and “to cut off man from the surfaces of the earth” means to cut off the affection of truth and wisdom.

Thus the Lord Jehovah hath said, Because ye say, Thou hast been a devourer of man and a bereaver of thy peoples, therefore thou shalt devour man no more, and thy sword shall not bereave any more; the desolate cities shall be full of the flock of man (36:9–14, 38).

[13] In Revelation: He measured the wall of the holy Jerusalem, a hundred and forty- four cubits, the measure of a man, which is that of an angel (21:17). That this signifies, that “the wall of the holy Jerusalem was a hundred and forty-four cubits, and that this was the measure of a man, which is that of an angel,” no one can understand unless he knows what is signified by “the holy Jerusalem,” by its “wall,” by the number “one hundred and forty-four,” likewise by “man,” and by “angel.” “The holy Jerusalem” signifies the church in respect to doctrine; “wall” signifies truth protecting; the number “one hundred and forty-four” signifies all truths from good in the complex; “man” signifies the reception of these from affection, and “angel” signifies the same; it is therefore said, “the measure of a man, which is that of an angel;” “measure” signifying quality. From this it is clear how these words are to be spiritually understood. (These things may be seen more clearly explained in the Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, n. 1.) 280c.

And from this also it is that the whole angelic heaven appears as one man, and also each society there; and moreover, that the angels appear in a perfect human form. (See further on this in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 59–67, 68–72, 73–77, 87–102.) [16] It was on this account that the four cherubim, which signify the guard and providence of the Lord that the higher heavens he not approached except through the good of love, were seen as men, although they each had four faces; and that the Lord was seen above them as a Man. That the four cherubim were seen as men is evident in Ezekiel: This was the appearance of the four animals; they had the likeness of a man, but each one had four faces (1:5, 6). Likewise the two cherubim upon the mercy seat were in face like men. That the Lord was seen above the four cherubim as a man is also stated in the same prophet: Above the expanse which was over the head of the cherubim was as it were the appearance of a sapphire stone, the likeness of a throne, and upon the likeness of the throne a likeness as the appearance of a man upon it above (1:26). 281a.

(That “the birds of heaven” signify things intellectual and rational, in both senses, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 745, 776, 866, 988, 991, 3219, 5149, 7441.) [2] That “eagle” signifies intelligence is evident from the following passages in the Word. In Ezekiel: A great eagle, great in wings, long in pinions, full of feathers, which had divers colors [embroidery], came upon Lebanon, and took a twig of cedar; he plucked off the head of its shoots, and carried it into a land of traffic; and set it in the city of spice dealers. He took of the seed of the land, and placed it in a field of sowing; he took it to great waters, and placed it carefully; and it sprouted and became a luxuriant vine of low stature, so that its branches looked to it, and the roots thereof were under it; so it became a vine that produced shoots and sent out boughs. And there was another great eagle, great in wings and full of feathers; and behold, this vine did bend its roots toward it and sent forth its branches toward it to war it from the beds of its plantation; it was planted in a good field by many waters, to make the bough and to bear fruit, that it might be a vine of magnificence (17:1–8). The establishment of a spiritual church by the Lord is here treated of, and in the internal sense the process of its establishment or of the regeneration of the man of that church from beginning to end is described. By the first eagle the process of regeneration of the natural or external man by means of knowledges and cognitions from the Word is described; and by the other eagle the process of regeneration of the spiritual or internal man by means of truths from good is described; therefore the first eagle signifies the intelligence of the natural man, and the second the intelligence of the spiritual man. Let it be also explained briefly what these particulars signify. The first eagle is said to have been “great in wings, long in pinions, full of feathers,” and this signifies an abundance of the knowledges and cognitions of truth and good, from which comes the first intelligence, which is the intelligence of the natural man; it is therefore said that “it had divers colors”"

(That “vine” is the spiritual church, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 1069,6375,9277.) Thus far the beginning of the church with man, which takes place in the natural or external man, has been described; its establishment which takes place in the spiritual or internal man is now described by the other eagle; because this signifies spiritual intelligence, it said that “the vine did bend its roots toward it, that is, the eagle, and send forth its branches toward it;” for “roots” signify knowledges, and “branches” the cognitions of truth and good, which are all applied to the truths which are n the spiritual or internal man; without their spiritual application man does not become wise at all.

Who are these that fly as a cloud, and as doves to the windows? (60:7, 8). This treats of the Lord’s coming, and the illustration of the Gentiles at that time; and “the flocks of Arabia that shall be gathered together” signify the knowledges of truth and good; “the rams of Nebaioth that shall minister” signify the truths that guide the life from a spiritual affection; “to fly as a cloud and as doves to the windows” signifies examination and scrutiny of truth from the sense of the letter of the Word; therefore “to fly” signifies circumspection; for “cloud” signifies the sense of the letter of the Word, “doves” the spiritual affection of truth, and “windows” truth in light. That such is the meaning of these words can be seen from the signification of “the flocks of Arabia,” “the rams of Nebaioth,” “cloud,” “doves,” and “windows.” [6] In David: Fear and trembling were come upon me. And I said, Who will give me a wing like a dove’s? I will fly away where I may dwell. Lo, I will wander far away; I will lodge in the wilderness (Ps. 55:5–7). This treats of temptation and of distress then; “fear and trembling” signify such distress; the inquiry into truth then, and circumspection whither to turn oneself, is signified by “Who will give me awing like a dove’s? I will fly away where I may dwell.” “Wing of a dove” means the affection of spiritual truth; “to fly away where I may dwell” means by that affection to rescue the life from damnation; that as yet there is no hope of deliverance is signified by “Lo, I will wander far away, and will lodge in the wilderness.” [7] In Hosea: Ephraim, as a bird shall their glory fly away; yea if they have brought up sons, then I will make them bereaved of man (9:11, 12)."

[8] In Moses: Ye shall not make to you the form of any beast upon the earth, nor the form of any winged bird that flieth towards heaven (Deut. 4:16, 17). This signifies in the internal sense that man must not acquire for himself wisdom and intelligence from self, or from what is his own, for “beasts that walk upon the earth” signify the affections of good, from which is wisdom, and “birds” signify the affections of truth from which is intelligence. That they should not make to themselves the form of these signifies that the things signified are not to be acquired from man, that is, from what is his own. It is said, “the winged bird that flieth towards heaven,” because “winged bird” signifies the understanding of spiritual truth, and “to fly towards heaven” signifies the circumspection that belongs to intelligence in things Divine. [9] From this it can now be seen what is signified by this cherub’s appearing “like a flying eagle” as also what is signified in Isaiah by: The seraphim, which had six wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly (6:2); namely that the “wings with which be covered his face” signify the affection of spiritual truth; the “wings with which he covered his feet” the affection of natural truth therefrom; and the “wings with which he did By” circumspection and presence, here omnipresence,"

[10] “To fly” in reference to man signifies circumspection and at the same time presence, because sight is present with the object that it sees; its appearing far away or at a distance is because of the intermediate objects that appear at the same time, and can be measured in respect to space. This can be fully confirmed by the things that exist in the spiritual world. In that world spaces themselves are appearances, arising from the diversity of affections and of thought therefrom; consequently, when any persons or things appear far away, and an angel or spirit desires from intense affection to be with such, or to examine the things that are at a distance, he is at once present there. The like is true of thought, which is man’s internal or spiritual sight. Things previously seen thought sees within itself irrespective of space, thus altogether as present. This is why “flying” is predicated of the understanding and of its intelligence, and why it signifies circumspection and presence. 283a. Verse 8. And the four animals, each by itself, had six wings round about, signifies the appearance of the spiritual Divine on all sides about the celestial Divine. This is evident from the signification of the four animals, which were the cherubim, as being the Lord’s Divine guard and providence that the higher heavens be not approached except from the good of love and of charity; and as this is the significance of the four animals as regards their bodies, they signify also the celestial Divine (of which presently). It is evident also from the signification of “six wings round about,” as meaning the spiritual Divine round about the celestial Divine (of which also presently). The “cherubim” in respect to their bodies signify the celestial Divine, and in respect to their wings the spiritual Divine; because all things that represent heavenly things signify in respect to their bodies what is essential, and in respect to what is about them what is formal. So man also, in respect to his body signifies good in essence, and in respect to the encompassing things good in form. Celestial good is good in essence, and spiritual good is good in form; and this for the reason that the will, in which good resides, is man himself, or the man in"

[2] But let it be told first what the celestial Divine is, and what the spiritual Divine is. The heavens are divided into two kingdoms, one of which is called the celestial kingdom, and the other the spiritual kingdom. They differ in this, that those in the celestial kingdom are in the good of love to the Lord, and those in the spiritual kingdom are in the good of charity towards the neighbor. Therefore the celestial Divine is the good of love to the Lord, and the spiritual Divine is the good of charity towards the neighbor. Moreover, according to these goods the heavens are arranged; the highest or third heaven consists of those who are in celestial good, or in the good of love to the Lord; and the heaven that succeeds this, and is called the middle or second heaven, consists of those who are in spiritual good, or in the good of charity towards the neighbor; and as celestial good is good in the highest place, and spiritual good is good in the second place, therefore the latter is round about the former; for that which is above is also within, and that which is below is also without, and what is without is round about. This is why in the Word higher things, and things in the midst, signify things interior; and lower things, and things round about, signify things exterior. Now as each good, the celestial and the spiritual, guards, and as the “animals,” that is, the cherubim, in respect to their bodies signify the celestial Divine, and in respect to their wings the spiritual Divine, it is clear that by “the four animals, each by itself, were seen to have six wings round about,” the appearance of the spiritual Divine on all sides round about the celestial Divine is signified. (But a fuller idea of these things can be had from what is said and shown in the work on Heaven and Hell; first, from the chapter where it is shown that The Divine of the Lord makes Heaven, n. 7–12; then from the chapter, The Divine of the Lord in Heaven is Love to Him, and Charity towards the Neighbor, n. 13–19; and lastly, in the chapter, Heaven is divided into two Kingdoms, a Celestial Kingdom and a Spiritual Kingdom, n. 20–28.)"

[3] The cherubim were seen as animals because heavenly things are represented in ultimates in various ways, as can he seen from many passages in the Word; as: That the Holy Spirit appeared as a dove over Jesus when He was baptized (Matt. 3:16, 17). And that the Divine of the Lord appeared as a lamb (Rev. 5:6, 8, 13). And from this the Lord was also called a Lamb (Rev. 6:1, 16; 7:9, 10, 14, 17; 12:11; 13:8; 14:1, 4; 17:14; 19:7, 9; 21:22, 23, 27). There were “four cherubim,” and “each had six wings,” because “four” signifies celestial good, and “six” spiritual good; for “four” signifies conjunction, and inmost conjunction with the Lord is through love to Him; but “six” signifies communication, and communication with the Lord is by means of charity towards the neighbor. [4] That “wings” signify the spiritual Divine, which in its essence is truth from good, can be seen from the following passages. In David: If ye have lain among the ranks, [ye shall have] the wings of a dove overlaid with silver, and her pinions with the yellow of gold; when Thou, Shaddai, dost spread out, kings shall be in it (Ps. 68:13, 14). What it means that “those who lie among the ranks shall have the wings of a dove overlaid with silver, and her pinions with the yellow of gold,” and that “kings shall be in it when Shaddai spreadeth out,” can be understood only from the internal sense; in that sense “to lie among the ranks” signifies to live according to the statutes; “the wings of a dove overlaid with silver” signify spiritual truths; her “pinions with the yellow of gold” signify spiritual good from which are those truths; “Shaddai” signifies a state of temptations; “kings in it” signify truths in that state and after it. “The wings of a dove overlaid with silver” signify spiritual truths, because “wing” signifies the spiritual, “dove” signifies truth from"

[5] In the same: God rode upon a cherub, He did fly, and was borne upon the wings of the wind (Ps. 18:10). “God rode upon a cherub” signifies the Lord’s Divine Providence; “He did fly” signifies omnipresence in the spiritual world; “He was borne upon the wings of the wind” signifies omnipresence in the natural world; “wings of the wind” are things spiritual, from which are things natural. [6] In the same: Jehovah covereth thee under His pinion, and under His wings shalt thou trust; truth is a shield and a buckler (Ps. 91:4). “To cover under the pinion” signifies to guard by Divine truth, which is the spiritual Divine; and “to trust under His wings” signifies under truth known (verum scientificum), which is the spiritual natural Divine; and as both signify truth, and “to cover” signifies guarding by means of it, it is said, “truth is a shield and a buckler.” This makes clear what is signified: By being hidden under the shadow of God’s wings (Ps. 17:8); By putting trust under the shadow of His wings (Ps. 36:7; 57:1); Also by singing under the shadow of His wings (Ps. 63:7)."

In Ezekiel: When I passed by thee, and saw thee, that behold thy time was the time of loves, I spread My wing over thee, and I covered thy nakedness (16:8). Here Jerusalem is treated of, and by it the church is meant, here its reformation; “the time of loves” signifies the state when it could be reformed; “I spread My wing over thee” signifies spiritual truth by which reformation is effected; “I covered thy nakedness” signifies putting evil out of sight thereby; for the evil that man has by heredity and afterwards from what is his own is put out of sight, that is, so removed as not to appear, by spiritual truths, which are truths from good. [8] In David: Jehovah covereth Himself with light as with a garment; He stretcheth out the heavens like a curtain; He layeth the beams of His chambers in the waters; He maketh the clouds His chariot; He walketh upon the wings of the wind (Ps. 104:2, 3). The “light with which Jehovah covereth Himself” signifies Divine truth in the heavens; it is called His “garment” because it proceeds from Him as a sun, and is thus outside of Him and about Him. This has a like meaning with the “light” and “the garments” of the Lord, when He was transfigured (Matt. 17:9; Mark 9:3; Luke 9:28–37). “He stretcheth out the heavens like a curtain” signifies filling heaven and them that are therein with Divine truth, and thereby with intelligence; “He layeth the beams of His chambers in the waters” means to fill those who are in the ultimate heaven and in the church with the knowledges of truth and good; “He maketh the clouds His chariot” signifies the doctrine of truth from the literal sense of the Word, “clouds” mean that sense, and “chariot” doctrine; “to walk upon the wings of the wind” signifies the spiritual sense of the Word contained in the literal sense.

[10] In Moses: As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, beareth them on her wings, so Jehovah doth lead him (Deut. 32:11, 12). Here comparison is made with an “eagle,” because “eagle” signifies intelligence, and “wing” the spiritual Divine, which is Divine truth, from which is intelligence. [11] In Isaiah: They that wait upon Jehovah renew their strength, they mount up with a wing like eagles (40:31). “To mount up with a wing like eagles” is to ascend into the light of heaven, which is Divine truth or the spiritual Divine front which is intelligence.

I heard the sound of the wings like the sound of great waters, as the voice of Shaddai; when they went, the voice of a tumult like the voice of a camp; when they stood they let down their wings. I heard the voice of their wings kissing each the other, and the voice of wheels beside them; the voice of the wings of the cherubim was heard even unto the court without, as the voice of God Shaddai. The likeness of hands was under their wings (1:4, 6, 23, 24; 3:12, 13; 10:5, 21). That “wings” here signify the spiritual Divine, which is the Lord’s Divine truth in His celestial kingdom, is evident from the particulars of the description here; that there were “four wings” signifies the spiritual Divine in that kingdom; that “their wings were erect one toward the other,” and “kissed each other,” signifies consociation and conjunction from the Lord of all in that kingdom; that “the wings covered their bodies” signifies the spiritual Divine there encompassing the celestial Divine; that “the sound of their wings was heard as the sound of great waters,” and “as the voice of wheels,” and “as the voice of Shaddai,” and that “the voice of the wings was heard even unto the court without” signifies the quality of the spiritual Divine, that is, of Divine truths in the ultimate heaven; for “voice” is predicated of truth; “waters” signify truths and the perception of truths; “wheels” the truths of doctrinals, because a “chariot” signifies doctrine; and “God Shaddai” means truth rebuking in temptations, and afterwards consoling; the “court without” is the ultimate heaven; the likeness of hands under the wings” signifies the power of Divine truth. 283d. [14] From this also can be seen what the “wings” of the cherubim, that were over the mercy seat which was upon the ark, signified, which are thus described in Moses: Make one cherub from the one end, and the other cherub from the other end; out of the mercy seat shall ye make the cherubim on the two"

And the cherubim shall spread out the wings upwards, covering over the mercy seat with the wings, and their faces shall be a man to his brother; towards the mercy seat shall be the faces of the cherubim. And thou shalt put the mercy seat above the ark; and to the ark thou shalt commit the testimony that I shall give thee (Exod. 25:18–21). Here, too, “cherubim” in like manner signify the Lord’s Providence in respect to guarding, that the highest heaven or the celestial kingdom be not approached except through the good of love from the Lord and to the Lord. The “testimony” or the “law,” in the ark, signifies the Lord Himself; the “ark” the inmost or the highest heaven; the “mercy seat” the hearing and reception of all things of worship which are from the good of love, and then expiation; the “wings of the cherubim” signify the spiritual Divine in that heaven or in that kingdom; that “the wings were spread out upwards,” and that “they covered the mercy seat,” and that “their faces were toward the mercy seat” signify the reception itself and bearing. (But all this can be seen more fully explained in Arcana Coelestia, n. 9506–9546.) And as the “wings of the cherubim” and their direction signify Divine truth heard and received by the Lord, therefore it follows in Moses: And there I will meet with thee, and I will speak with thee from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubim which are upon the ark of the testimony, all things which I will command unto the sons of Israel (verse 22 same chapter, and Num. 7:89). 283e. [15] As most expressions in the Word have a contrary sense also, so do “wings,” in which sense they signify falsities and reasonings from them; as in Revelation: Out of the smoke [of the pit of the abyss] went forth locusts. And the voice of their wings was as the voice of chariots of many horses running to war (9:2, 3, 9). “Locusts” signify falsities in extremes, and “horses” reasonings from them, and “war” signifies the combat of falsity against truth; it is therefore said, “the voice of the wings of the locusts was as the voice of chariots of many horses running to war.”"

This is evident also from the signification of “Holy, holy, holy,” as being that which is most holy proceeding from the Lord, for “holy” thrice named signifies most holy, for this reason that “three” in the Word signifies what is full, complete, and continuous (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 2788,4495, 7715)."

Let it first be told what is here meant by glorification. Glorification, when it is from the Lord is a perpetual influx with angels and men of Divine good with Divine truth; and glorification of the Lord among angels and men is reception and acknowledgment in heart that all good and all truth are from the Lord, and thence all intelligence, wisdom, and blessedness; this in the spiritual sense is what “giving thanks” signifies. Moreover, all glorification of the Lord by the angels of heaven and by the men of the church is not from themselves, but flows in from the Lord. Glorification that is from men and not from the Lord is not from the heart, but only from the activity of the memory, and thus from the mouth; and what goes forth from the memory and the mouth only, and not through them from the heart, is not heard in heaven, thus is not received by the Lord, but goes out into the world like any other sonorous words. This glorification is not an acknowledgment in heart that all good and all truth are from the Lord. It is said an acknowledgment in heart, which means from the life of the love; for “heart,” in the Word, signifies love, and love is a life according to the Lord’s precepts; when man is in this life, then there is glorification of the Lord, which is acknowledgment from the heart that all good and truth is from the Lord. This is meant by “being glorified,” in John: If ye abide in Me, and My words abide in you, ask whatsoever ye will and it shall be done unto you. Herein is My Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit, and that ye be My disciples (15:7, 8). 288b.

The two are mentioned together because in the particulars of the Word there is a heavenly marriage, which is the conjunction of truth and good. There is this marriage in the particulars of the Word, because the Divine that proceeds from the Lord is Divine truth united to Divine good; and because these together make heaven and also make the church, therefore this marriage is in the particulars of the Word; so also in the particulars of the Word is the Divine from the Lord, and the Lord Himself; this is why the Word is most holy. (That there is such a marriage in the particulars of the Word, see above, n. 238; and Arcana Coelestia, n. 2516, 2712, 3004, 3005, 3009, 4138, 5138, 5194, 5502, 6343, 7022, 7945, 8339, 9263, 9314.) [4] That “glory” signifies Divine truth from the Lord, see above (n. 33); that “honor” signifies Divine good follows from what has been said concerning the heavenly marriage in the particulars of the Word; as can also be seen from the following passages. In David: Jehovah made the heavens; glory and honor are before Him; strength and splendor are in His sanctuary (Ps. 96:5, 6). By “the heavens” the Divine that proceeds from the Lord is meant, since the heavens are from His Divine; and as the Divine that proceeds and makes the heavens is Divine truth and Divine good, it is said, “glory and honor are before Him;” “sanctuary” means the church; Divine good and Divine truth therein are meant by “strength and splendor.” (That the Divine of the Lord makes the heavens, see in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 7–12; and that the Divine of the Lord in the heavens is Divine truth and Divine good, n. 7, 13, 133, 137, 139, 140.)"

[6] In the same: The works of Jehovah are great. Glory and honor are His work (Ps. 111:2, 3). “The works of Jehovah” mean all things that proceed from Him and are done by Him; and as these are referable to Divine truth and Divine good, it is said, “His work is glory and honor.” [7] In the same: Generation to generation shall praise Thy works, and shall declare Thy mighty acts. Upon the honor of the magnificence of Thy glory and the words of Thy wonders will I meditate. And I will make known to the sons of men His mighty acts, and the glory of the honor of His kingdom (Ps. 145:4, 5, 12). “The honor of the magnificence of glory” means Divine good united to Divine truth; and “the glory of the honor” means Divine truth united to Divine good. This is so said because the unition is reciprocal; for Divine good proceeds from the Lord united to Divine truth; but by the angels in heaven and by the men of the church Divine truth is received and is united to Divine good; it is therefore said, “the glory of the honor of His kingdom,” for “His kingdom” means heaven and the church.

And in Thy honor mount, ride upon the word of truth (Ps. 45:3, 4). This also is said of the Lord; “to gird the sword upon the thigh” signifies Divine truth combating from Divine good (that this is signified by “sword upon the thigh,” see Arcana Coelestia, n. 10488); and because the Lord from Divine truth subjugated the hells, and brought the heavens into order, He is said to be “mighty in glory and honor,” and also “in honor mount and ride upon the word of truth;” this signifies to act from Divine good through Divine truth. [10] In the same: Thou hast made Him to be a little less than the angels, but thou hast crowned Him with glory and honor (Ps. 8:5). This also is said of the Lord; His state of humiliation is described by “thou hast made Him to be a little less than the angels,” and His state of glorification by “thou hast crowned Him with glory and honor.” “Glorifying” means uniting the Divine Itself to His Human, and also making His Human Divine.

And the glory and honor of the nations shall be brought into it (21:24, 26). This is said of the New Jerusalem, by which a new church in the heavens and on earth is signified; “nations” there signify all who are in good; and the “kings of the earth” all who are in truths from good; it is said of both that “they shall bring their glory and honor into it,” which means worship from the good of love to the Lord and from the truths of faith which are from the good of charity towards the neighbor. 289. To Him that sitteth upon the throne, that liveth unto ages of ages, signifies from whom are all things of heaven and of the church and eternal life. This is evident from the signification of “throne,” as being, in reference to the Lord, in general the whole heaven, in particular the spiritual heaven, and abstractly Divine truth proceeding; and as through this the heavens have existence, therefore “throne” here signifies all things of heaven and of the church (see above n. 253a); that “He that sitteth upon the throne” is the Lord, see also above (n. 267, 268). This is also evident from the signification of “living unto ages of ages,” as being that equal life is from Him (see above, n. 84); for “He that liveth” signifies that He alone is life, and therefore that everything of life with angels and men is from Him; and “unto ages of ages” signifies eternity. “Unto ages of ages” signifies eternity because in the world it signifies time throughout its whole extent; but in heaven, where there is not time like that in the world, it signifies eternity; for the"

Verse 10.

This is evident from the signification of “falling down,” as being humiliation, and then acknowledgment in heart; also from the signification of “four and twenty elders” as being those who are in truths from good (see above, n. 270); also from the signification of “He that sat upon the throne,” as being the Lord from whom are all things of heaven and of the church (see just above, n. 289). This and the following verses of this chapter treat of the reception of Divine truth and Divine good by the angels of heaven, and by the men of the church; while the verse immediately preceding treats of the Lord, that from Him Divine good and Divine truth proceed; this is signified by “the animals gave glory and honor and thanksgiving to Him that sitteth upon the throne and liveth unto ages of ages” (see above, n. 288, 289); but “the elders fell down before Him that sitteth upon the throne, and worshiped Him that liveth unto ages of ages,” signifies reception and acknowledgment;” for “to fall down” signifies humiliation, reception, and acknowledgment, and “the four and twenty elders” signify all who are in truth from good, both in the heavens and on earth. [2] It is to be known that the reception of Divine truth and Divine good, and the acknowledgment in heart that all things of heaven and the church and eternal life are from the Lord, are only with those who are in truth from good; and for the reason that such only are in love and faith; and it is those who are in love and faith that are conjoined to the Lord in soul and heart; into the soul and heart the Lord flows, and not into those things that are merely of the memory and of the speech therefrom; for the memory is merely"

This is evident from the signification of “falling down and worshiping,” as being humiliation and then acknowledgment in heart; also from the signification of “Him that liveth unto ages of ages,” as being that from the Lord is eternal life (see just above, n. 289). It is said humiliation, and then acknowledgment in heart, namely, that from the Lord are all good and all truth, and thence all intelligence, wisdom, and blessedness, since this acknowledgment is not given with anyone except in a state of humiliation; for when in humiliation, then man is removed from what is his own (ex suo proprio); and what is man’s own (proprium) receives and acknowledges nothing of good and truth from the Lord, for what is man’s own is nothing but evil, and evil rejects all good and all truth of heaven and the church. From this it can be seen why there must be humiliation, and why “falling down and worshiping” signifies humiliation, and then acknowledgment in heart. 292. And cast off their crowns before the throne, signifies humiliation, and then acknowledgment in heart that there is nothing of good from themselves, but that everything is from the Lord. This is evident from the signification of “crown,” as being good and wisdom therefrom (see above, n. 272); also from the signification of “to cast off before the throne,” that is to lay down there, as being to acknowledge from humiliation that this is not from oneself but from the Lord alone; for “to cast off” is to renounce from oneself, and “to lay down before the throne” is to acknowledge that it is from the Lord alone.

Truths from the Word with angels and men are in their memory; from it the Lord calls them out and conjoins them with good so far as the angel or man is in the spiritual affection of truth, and this affection he has when he lives according to the truths from the Word. Conjunction is effected in the interior or spiritual man, and from that in the exterior or natural man. This conjunction makes the church with man while he lives on the earth, and afterwards makes heaven with him; from which it is clear that without such conjunction no one can be saved; also that there is no conjunction of good and truth unless the man is living the life of love; to live the life of love is to do the Lord’s commandments, for to love is to do, since what man loves that he wills and that he does, but what he does not love that he does not will and therefore does not do. 293. Verse 11. Saying, Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive the glory, and the honor, and the power, signifies merit and righteousness belonging to the Lord’s Divine Human, that from it is all Divine truth and Divine good and salvation. This is evident from the signification of “Thou art worthy, O Lord,” as being merit and righteousness belonging to the Lord’s Divine Human (of which presently); also from the signification of “glory and honor,” as being in reference to the Lord’s Divine truth and Divine good which are from Him (see above, n. 288), also from the signification of “power,” as being salvation. “Power” here signifies salvation because all Divine power looks to salvation as an end; for by Divine power man is reformed, and afterwards introduced into heaven, and there withheld from evil and falsity and held in good and truth; and this the Lord only can effect. Those who claim for themselves the power to effect this are wholly ignorant of what salvation is, for they do not know what reformation is, nor what heaven with man is. To claim to oneself the Lord’s power is to claim power over the Lord Himself, which power is called “the power of darkness” (Luke 22:53). [2] That the power predicated of the Lord has regard chiefly to salvation is evident from the following passages. In John:"

I am the vine, ye are the branches; he that abideth in Me, and I in him, the same beareth much fruit; for apart from Me ye cannot do anything (15:5).

Moreover, the Lord has power over all things because He is God alone; but the salvation of the human race is the principal object of power, since for the sake of that the heavens and the worlds were created; and salvation is the reception of the proceeding Divine. [3] “Thou art worthy, O Lord,” signifies the merit and righteousness pertaining to the Lord’s Divine Human, because “Thou art worthy” signifies that He had merit. The Lord’s merit is that when He was in the world He subjugated the hells, and brought into order all things in the heavens, and glorified His Human, and this from His own power. By this means He saved all of the human race who believe in Him, that is, who love to do His precepts (John 1:12, 13). Moreover, this merit is called in the Word “righteousness,” (justice) and the Lord in respect to His Divine Human is called from this: Jehovah our Righteousness (Jer. 23:5, 6; 33:15, 16)."

For Thou hast created all things, signifies that from Him are all existence and life, and heaven also for those who receive. This is evident from the signification of “to create,” as being not only that all things came into existence from the Lord, but also that all life is from Him; and as the spiritual sense of the Word treats only of heaven and the church, therefore “to create” signifies primarily here to reform, thus to give heaven to those who receive, for this is to reform.

But here “to create” does not signify natural existence and life, but spiritual existence and life; and this is what is everywhere signified in the Word by “creating;” and for the reason that the existence of heaven and earth is not the end of creation, but a means to the end; the end of creation is that the human race may exist so that from it there may be an angelic heaven; and as this is the end, “to create” signifies to reform, which is to give heaven to those who receive. In the spiritual sense of the Word ends are meant, but in the sense of the letter only the means that involve the ends are spoken of; in this way the spiritual lies hid in the letter of the Word. 294b.

In Isaiah: I will give in the wilderness the cedar of Shittah, and the myrtle, and the oil tree; that they may see and know, and consider and understand together, that the hand of Jehovah hath done this, and the Holy One of Israel hath created it (41:19, 20).

The Lord’s presence with everyone with His Divine truth, from which are life and light, is meant by “the light shineth in the darkness, and lighteth every man coming into the world;” but that those who are in the falsities of evil do not perceive it, thus do not receive it, is meant by “the darkness apprehended it not,” and by “the world knew Him not;” for “darkness” signifies the falsities of evil. It is very plain that it is the Lord in respect to the Divine Human that is here meant by “the Word,” for it is said, “And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory,” “glory” also signifying the Divine truth. (That all things were created by Divine truth proceeding from the Lord, which is here meant by “the Word,” see in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 137, 139; and in the Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, n. 263.) This also makes clear that “to make” or “to create” here also signifies to make man new, or to reform him; for here, like as in the book of Genesis, “light” is immediately mentioned, which signifies Divine truth proceeding, by which all are reformed (see in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 126–140; and in the Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, n. 49). 295a. And by Thy will they are, and they were created, signifies that through Divine good they have being, and through Divine truth they have existence. This is evident from the signification of “will,” as being, in reference to the Lord, the Divine love; also from the signification of “are” (sunt) or “being (esse), as the good of love, here the Divine good of the Divine love received (of which presently) also from the signification of “they were created,” or “being created,” as being Divine truth also received, thus those reformed by it. “To be created” signifies to have existence, because only those who have been reformed are said to have existence; for in them is life, and they have intelligence and wisdom; while those who are not reformed have no life in them, but spiritual death, neither have they intelligence and wisdom, but insanity and folly,"

Everything indeed, that appears to any of the senses is said to have existence, but this cannot be said of man spiritually unless he is in good and truth; for man is created that he may be living, intelligent, and wise; consequently when he is dead, insane, and foolish, to that extent he does not exist as a man. There are two things that cause man to be a man, namely, good and truth, both from the Lord; good is the esse of his life, but truth is the existere of life therefrom; for all truth has existence from good, since it is the form and therefore the quality of good; and since good is the esse of life, and truth is the existere of life therefrom, and “to be created” signifies to have existence, it is said, “by Thy will they are, and they were created.” This, then, is the spiritual in these words. 295b. [2] “Will” in reference to the Lord means Divine love; because the Divine Itself, from which are all things, is the Divine love. The Lord, therefore, appears before the angels as a Sun, fiery and flaming, and this for the reason that in the spiritual world love appears as fire, consequently in reference to the Lord, heaven, and the church, “fire” in the Word signifies love. From that sun in the heavens heat and light proceed; and heat there is Divine good proceeding, and light is Divine truth proceeding. (This is more fully shown in the work on Heaven and Hell, on the sun of heaven, n. 116–125; and on heat and light in heaven, n. 126–140.) And since the Divine Itself from which are all things is the Divine love, so “will” in reference to the Lord is Divine love, for what love itself wills, that is the good of love; the truth which is said to be of faith is merely a means that good may have existence, and that truth may afterwards exist from good. Will and understanding with man are from this origin, the will is the receptacle of the good of love with man, and the understanding is the receptacle of the truth of faith with him. The understanding is the medium by which the will may be reformed, and by which afterwards the will may appear in form, such as it is by means of the understanding. From this it is clear that the will is the esse of man’s life, and the understanding is the existere of life therefrom. (But this is also more fully shown in the Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, where the will and understanding are treated of, n. 28–35.)"

      "text": "APOCALYPSE EXPLAINED 640 [3] Because man’s will is his love, and God’s will is the Divine love, it can be seen what is meant in the spiritual sense by “doing the will of God” and “the will of the Father,” namely, that it is to love God above all things, and the neighbor as oneself. And as to love is to will, so it is also to do; for what a man loves, that he wills, and what he wills he also does. Therefore “doing the will of God” or “of the Father” means doing His commandments, or living according to them from the affection of love or charity. This is what is meant by “the will of God” and “of the Father” in the following passages. In John: God heareth not sinners; but if anyone worship God and do His will, him He heareth (9:31). In Matthew (that the one who does the will of the Father who is in the heavens shall enter into the kingdom of the heavens): Not everyone that saith unto Me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but He that doeth the will of My Father that is in the heavens (7:21). Thy kingdom come; Thy will be done, as in heaven so upon the earth (6:10). It is not the will of the Father that one of these little ones should perish (18:14). “It is not His will that one of these little ones should perish” means evidently love. It is said “the will of the Father,” because “Father” means Divine good. In John: If ye abide in Me, and My words abide in you, you may ask what ever ye will, and it shall be done unto you (15:7). Whatsoever they will and ask shall be done for those who abide in the Lord and in whom His words abide, because they then will nothing except what the Lord gives them to will, and that is good, and good is from Him."

[4] The Lord’s will in the Old Testament is called His “good pleasure,” and this likewise means the Divine love; and to do His good pleasure or His will signifies to love God and the neighbor, thus to live according to the commandments of the Lord, since this is to love God and the neighbor, and this comes down from the Lord’s love. For no one can love the Lord and the neighbor except from the Lord; for this is the veriest good for man, and all good is from the Lord. That “good pleasure” has this signification is clear from the following passages. In Isaiah: In My wrath I smote thee, but in My good pleasure have I had mercy on thee (60:10). “To smite in anger” signifies temptation; “in good pleasure to have mercy” signifies deliverance from love; “to have mercy” is to do good to the needy from love. [5] In David: My prayer is unto thee, O Jehovah, in the time of good pleasure; O God, for the greatness of Thy mercy answer me, in the truth of Thy salvation (Ps. 69:13). “The time of Jehovah’s good pleasure” signifies acceptance from love; “time,” when said of men, signifies the existing state, but in reference to Jehovah, perpetual existing, thus His love, because this is perpetual. Hearing and help from love through the proceeding Divine which is the Divine truth, is signified by “for the greatness of Thy mercy answer me, in the truth of Thy salvation.” [6] In Isaiah: Jehovah said, In the time of My good pleasure have I answered thee, and in the day of salvation have I helped thee (49:8). Here also “the time of good pleasure,” that is, of will, signifies the Divine love; and “to answer” signifies to bring aid, and to benefit."

This is said of the coming of the Lord; and “the year of Jehovah’s good pleasure” signifies the time and state of the men of the church, when from love they are to be succored, therefore it is also said, “to comfort all that mourn.” [8] In David: Thou dost bless the righteous; Thou wilt compass him with Thy good pleasure as with a shield (Ps. 5:12). Here “good pleasure” stands plainly for the Divine love, from which the Lord protects everyone; protection by the Lord from love is signified by “Thou wilt compass him as with a shield.” [9] In the same: Jehovah openeth the hand and satisfieth every living thing with His good pleasure (Ps. 145:16); “to open the hand” signifies to gift with good; and “to satisfy every living thing with good pleasure” signifies from love to enrich with Divine truth all who receive life from Him.

This makes clear what is signified by Joseph’s having “of the precious things of the earth and the fullness thereof, and the good pleasure of Him that dwelleth in the thornbush;” “the precious things of the earth” are spiritual goods and truths therefrom belonging to the church; “the earth” is the church; the “good pleasure of Him that dwelleth in the thorn bush” is the Lord’s Divine love of truth; the “thorn bush” in which the Lord appeared to Moses signifies that Divine love; “the head of Joseph” signifies the wisdom of the internal man; and “the crown of the head of the Nazarite of his brethren” signifies the intelligence and knowledge of the external man; “Naphtali” (named from wrestlings) signifies temptations and after them consolation and blessing from the Divine love, which is meant by “satisfied with the good pleasure and the blessing of Jehovah.” [11] In Isaiah: Wilt thou call this a fast, and the day of Jehovah’s good pleasure? Is it not to break thy bread to the hungry; and when thou seest the naked that thou cover him? (58:5, 7). That “Jehovah’s good pleasure,” in reference to men, signifies to live according to His commandments, which is to love God and the neighbor (as was said above) is evident; for it is said that “His good pleasure is to break the bread to the hungry, and to cover the naked;” “to break bread to the hungry” signifies from love to do good to the neighbor who desires good; and “to cover the naked” signifies to instruct in truths him who desires to be instructed. [12] In David: I delight in doing Thy good pleasure (that is, Thy will) O my God; and Thy law is in my bowels (Ps. 40:8). Teach me to do Thy good pleasure; Thy good spirit shall lead me into the land of uprightness (Ps. 143:10)."

To “do the good pleasure of Jehovah God” signifies to live according to His commandments; this is His good pleasure or His will, because from Divine love He wills that all should be saved, and by it they are saved. Moreover, in the Hebrew expression “good pleasure” also means will; for whatever is done according to the will is well pleasing, and the Divine love wills nothing else than that love from itself may be with angels and men, and His love is with them when they love to live according to His commandments. That this is to love the Lord He teaches in John 14:15, 21, 23, 24; 15:10, 14; 21:15–17). 295d. [13] That “will” signifies love in a contrary sense, namely, the love of evil and the love of falsity, is evident in John: As many as received Jesus, to them gave He the power to become the sons of God, to them that believe in His name; who were born, not of bloods nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but from God (1:12, 13). “To believe in the Lord’s name” signifies to live according to the commandments of His teaching; that “the Lord’s name” signifies all things by which He is worshiped, thus all things of love and faith, see above (n. 102a, 135). “Not of bloods” signifies not in a life contrary to good and truth; “not of the will of the flesh” signifies not in a love of evil; “not of the will of man (vir)” signifies not in the love of falsity. (That “flesh,” in reference to man, means the voluntary that is man’s own [proprium voluntarium], thus evil, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 148, 149, 780, 999, 3813, 8409, 10283; and that man [vir] means the intellectual that is man’s own [proprium intellectuale], which is falsity, see n. 4823.)"
