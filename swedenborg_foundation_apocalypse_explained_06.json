      "text": "APOCALYPSE EXPLAINED 3294 Editor’s Preface This edition of Apocalypse Explained was translated by John C. Ager and revised by John Whitehead. The text for this edition was electronically scanned from the Foundation’s Standard Edition. This process has allowed the book to be completely redesigned and set in a new and more readable typeface. Certain stylistic changes have also been introduced. These include modernized spelling and punctuation as well as substituting new words for terms whose meanings have become obscure or have changed since the nineteenth century. Arabic numerals have replaced roman numerals in Bible passages, and certain capitalized words including pronouns referring to God have been lowercased to reflect contemporary usage. All these changes have been carefully made in order to make the book easier to read and use while preserving the dignity and power of the original Latin. On the whole, however, the Ager/Whitehead translation has not been materially altered. Volume 6 of Apocalypse Explained concludes Swedenborg’s verse- by-verse exposition, or commentary, of the biblical text of the Apocalypse, commonly known as Revelation or the Revelation of John. This volume covers chapters 17, 18, and the first part of 19, breaking off after verse 10. To round out the volume, the reviser added three other posthumous documents: (1) On Divine Love and Divine Wisdom, a draft version of the later published work Divine Love and Wisdom (1763); (2) Athanasian Creed, which was first published as part of an appendix to the Latin-English edition of Apocalypse Explained, translated and edited by Samuel Worcester; and (3) Concerning the Lord and Concerning the Holy Spirit (generally identified by the Latin title De Domino ), which Worcester also published as part of the appendix to the Latin-English Apocalypse Explained. None of these three documents had the usual paragraph numbers which Swedenborg consistently used in his published theological works. However, the Swedenborg Society, London, had assigned"

This volume of the Standard Edition has added these now widely recognized paragraph numbers to these documents. As was the custom in his day, Swedenborg referred to the Psalms as the book of David, and to the Pentateuch (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy) as the books of Moses. As with previous printings, the bold numerals in brackets, [2], [3], etc., indicate divisions of Swedenborg’s longer numbered sections that were added for the convenience of the reader by J. F. Potts in his six-volume Swedenborg Concordance (London: Swedenborg Society, 1888–1902). The numbers in parentheses (6), (7), etc., are divisions of the exposition by the author. Italicized letters following a number (518a, 518b) are subdivisions added by the Latin editor, S. H. Worcester. The critical notes were originally compiled by Worcester when he edited the Latin text for a Latin-English edition of Apocalypse Explained published by the Swedenborg Foundation between 1889 and 1897. These notes were used sparingly by Whitehead in this English edition, principally in cases where some difference in meaning is involved.

And there came one of the seven angels that had the seven vials and spoke with me, saying unto me, Come, I will show thee the judgment of the great harlot that sitteth upon many waters; 2. With whom the kings of the earth committed whoredom, and they that dwell on the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her whoredom. 3. And he carried me away in the spirit into a wilderness; and I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns. 4. And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet, and inwrought with gold and precious stone and pearls, having in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and the uncleanness of her whoredom. 5. And upon her forehead a name written, Mystery, Babylon the great, the mother of the whoredoms and of the abominations of the earth. 6. And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus; and when I saw her I wondered with great wonder. 7. And the angel said unto me, Wherefore dost thou wonder? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carrieth her, which hath the seven heads and the ten horns. 8. The beast that thou sawest was and is not, and is about to come up out of the abyss, and to go into perdition; and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names have not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, seeing the beast that was and is not, and yet is. 9. This is the mind that hath wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, where the woman sitteth upon them. 10. And they are seven kings; the five have fallen, and the one is, the other is not yet come; and when he is come he must remain a short time. 11.

As this chapter and the following treat of Babylon, before these chapters are explained, what is meant by Babylon in general and in particular shall be told; also what it is in the beginning, and what it becomes afterwards by degrees. “Babylon” (or Babel) means the church consisting of those who by means of the holy things of the church strive to gain dominion over the whole world, and this by dominion over the souls of men, claiming to themselves authority to save whomsoever they will; and these finally seek dominion over heaven and hell and make it their own. And to this end they draw and transfer to themselves all the Lord’s authority, as if it had been given them by him. The church consisting of such is very different in the beginning from what it becomes in process of time. In the beginning they are as it were in zeal for the Lord, for the Word, for love and faith, and especially for the salvation of men. But in that zeal the fire of domineering lies hidden; and in process of time as dominion increases this breaks forth; and so far as it comes into act the holy things of the church become the means, and dominion itself the end; and when dominion becomes"

And when they do this they pervert every good and every truth of the church, and thus profane the holy things of the church. These things are “Babylon.” [2] That this is so has been shown me in a vivid way. In the spiritual world there were those who strove to gain such dominion; and as they knew that the Lord alone has all power, they put on a seeming zeal for him and for heaven and for the church, and they labored with all their might to worship the Lord alone, and to observe in a holy way all things of the Word; and they arranged to have sanctity and integrity prevail in all. But it was granted to know that in such zeal an ardent desire of domineering over all others lay hidden, believing that the things they arranged would be acceptable to the Lord. For just as soon as they began to gain dominion, their end was gradually disclosed, which was that they and not the Lord should rule, and thus that the Lord should serve them and not they the Lord; and they were indignant if they were not permitted, like gods, to dispose everything at their will; and it was perceived also that they thought lightly of the Lord, and even rejected him if he did not grant them authority to do all things as they pleased, and unless he assented to every decision of theirs. It was also perceived that if they dared, they would, under some pretext, transfer his Divine authority to themselves; but they were afraid of being for this reason cast down into hell. By this it was shown how Babylon begins and how it ends. The conclusion to be drawn from this was that when dominion becomes the end, and the holy things of the church become the means, the worship of God is turned, under various pretexts, into the worship of men; so that they themselves are actually gods, and the Lord is not actually God, but is so called for the sake of form. [3] Now because dominion by means of the holy things of the church over the souls of men, over heaven, and over the Lord himself, is inwardly profane, it follows that it is infernal; for the devils who are in hell desire nothing so much as to have dominion"

And since those who in the world cast the Lord down from the seat of his kingdom and place themselves upon it, are in heart like devils, it is evident that a church made up of such must in process of time be devastated as to all its good and all its truth; and this is its end. That such are devils is evident from the same in the spiritual world. Those who have exercised the Lord’s Divine authority in the world talk about the Lord after death in a most holy manner, and worship him with all external devotion. But when their interiors are looked into (for in the spiritual world these can be uncovered and looked into) they are seen to be profane, because they are godless and full of diabolical craft; and from this it becomes clear that their holy externals had served them as means to an end, which was dominion. At one time the question arose among spirits whether any devil in hell could do the like; one of the worst was therefore summoned, and was told that he would receive dominion over many if he would worship the Lord with sanctity and acknowledge his Divine to be equal to the Divine of the Father, and at the same time would observe all things of worship. When he heard of dominion over many he immediately disposed his interiors to craft and his exteriors to holiness, and worshiped the Lord in a more holy manner than many angels, burning with anger against all who would not adore him. But as soon as he observed that dominion was not given to him, he burned with anger against the Lord himself, and denied both his Divine and the Divine of the Father, and even cast reproaches upon both; for he was an atheist. [4] That such is Babylon at this day is clearly evident from the fact that under the pretext of the keys having been given to Peter, they have transferred to themselves all the Divine authority of the Lord, that they have shut up Divine truth from the people by taking away the Word, and that they have ascribed to the decrees of the pope a holiness equal and even superior to the holiness of the Word; also that they teach little, if at all, the fear and worship of God, but only a fear and worship of themselves, and also a worship of the saints for the sake of themselves.

      "text": "APOCALYPSE EXPLAINED 3300 Babylon in its end is a church empty and void of all the good of love to God, and of all the good of love towards the neighbor, and consequently of all truth. It is therefore no longer a church but an idolatry, and as such it differs but little from the heathenisms of the ancients, who worshiped Baal, Ashtaroth, Beelzebub, and others, and yet had temples, appointed feasts, altars, sacrifices, incense, libations and other things like those of the Jewish church. These things have been said about Babylon in its beginning and at its end, to make known why in the Word Babylon is sometimes extolled even to heaven, and sometimes cast down even to hell. 1029b. [5] That Babylon is such can be seen fully from the descriptions and representations of it in the prophets, and especially in Daniel. First, from the statue of king Nebuchadnezzar, in Daniel: There appeared to king Nebuchadnezzar in a dream, a statue standing opposite the king; its head was of good gold, its breast and arms of silver, its belly and thighs of brass, its legs of iron, and its feet part of iron and part of clay. Afterwards a stone was cut out, not by hands, which smote the statue upon its feet, which were of iron and clay, and brake them in pieces; and then the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, were broken in pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshing floors, so that the wind carried them away, and no place was found for them. But the stone that smote the statue became a great rock (Dan. 2:31–35). From the interpretation of this dream by Daniel, it is clear that it describes the state of the church that becomes Babylon, from its beginning to its end. It is Babylon that is described, for these things were seen by the king of Babylon in a dream, and he saw a statue opposite to him; also Daniel said plainly to the king: Thou art its head which is gold (Dan. 2:38). The successive states of this church even to the last are depicted by the head, breast, arms, belly, thighs, legs, and feet of that statue; likewise by the gold, silver, brass, iron and clay, of which the statue consisted from top to bottom. All this makes clear that this church in its beginning was full of wisdom from the good of love to the"

That the toes of its feet were “part of iron and part of clay” signifies that the last state of that church would be without any good of love and without any wisdom; for this is thus interpreted by Daniel: Whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of man; but they shall not cohere one with the other, even as iron doth not mingle with clay (Dan. 2:43). “The seed of man” signifies the Divine truth, thus the truth of the Word; and by this no coherence is effected, because at the end of the church it is falsified by application to the worship of men. The destruction of this church is described by “the stone brake in pieces all parts of the statue.” “Stone” signifies the Divine truth; and the “rock” which the stone became signifies the Lord as to the Divine truth. Its destruction is the last judgment. The new church that will then be established by the Lord is described by these words: The God of the heavens shall make a kingdom to arise which shall not perish for ages, and his kingdom shall not be committed to another people. It shall break in pieces and consume all those kingdoms, but itself shall stand for ages (Dan. 2:44). Here and elsewhere in the Word “kingdom” signifies the church; so, too, does a “man,” in the form of which the statue was. [6] The church that afterwards became Babylon is also described by the “tree” seen by King Nebuchadnezzar in a dream, in Daniel: I was looking, when behold a tree in the midst of the earth, and the height thereof was great; the tree grew and became strong, and the height thereof reached even unto heaven, and the sight thereof even unto the end of all the earth; the leaf thereof was beautiful, and the flower thereof much; the beast of the field had shadow under it, and the birds of heaven dwelt in the branches of it, and all flesh was nourished by it. But behold, a watcher and an holy one came down from heaven, crying with all might, saying thus, Hew down the tree and cut off his branches, and scatter his flower, let the beast flee from under him, and the birds from his branches; but leave the stump of his root in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the herb of the field, and let him"

That King Nebuchadnezzar, consequently Babylon itself, is meant by that tree and all things of it, is plainly declared in verses 20–22; and that the things that were heard happened to the king, namely, that he was driven out from man, dwelt with the beast of the field, ate the herb like oxen, until seven times had passed over him, is evident from verses 32–34, of the same chapter. That these things came upon him because of the love of self and the pride of his own dominion is evident from these words of his: Is not this great Babylon, which I have built for the house of the kingdom, by the might of my power and for the glory of mine honor? (Dan. 2:30.) And afterwards when he was restored: I, Nebuchadnezzar, honor the king of the heavens, all whose works are truth, and his ways judgment; and those that walk in pride he is able to humble (Dan. 2:37). This state of Nebuchadnezzar depicts the state of those after death who exalt themselves as gods over all things of the church, namely, “they are driven out from man,” which means that as to the understanding they are no longer like men; “they become beasts and eat grass like oxen,” and “their hairs grow like eagles’ feathers and their nails like birds’ claws” signifies that they are wholly sensual, that in place of intelligence they have foolishness and in place of wisdom insanity; “to eat grass, to have hair like eagles’ feathers, and nails like birds’ claws” signifies to become sensual. 1029c. [7] The successive states of the church which at length became Babylon are described also by “the four beasts coming up out of the sea,” in Daniel:"

Afterwards another beast, a second, like a bear, and it raised itself up on one side, and it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth; and they said thus unto it, Arise, devour much flesh. After this, behold another like a leopard, which had upon its back four wings like those of birds, and four heads; and dominion was given to it. Afterwards a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible and exceedingly strong and it had great teeth of iron, it devoured and brake in pieces, and trampled the residue with its feet (Dan. 7:3–7). That by these beasts also the successive states of the church from its first to its last are described may be seen above (n. 316, 556, 650, 780, 781). That in the first state they were in truths, and thus in intelligence, is signified by “the lion that had an eagle’s wings,” and that afterwards appeared “like a man, and a man’s heart was given to it.” That in the last state they are in falsities from evil of every kind is signified by “the fourth beast, that was dreadful, that devoured and brake in pieces, and trampled the residue with its feet.” Of this beast other things are said in verses 23–25. [8] That the church that has become Babylon will then be destroyed, and a new church established that will worship the Lord, is meant by these words: I was seeing, and behold with the clouds of the heavens one like the son of man. And there was given him dominion and glory and a kingdom, that all peoples, nations, and tongues might worship him. His dominion is the dominion of an age, which shall not pass away; and his kingdom that which shall not perish. And the kingdom and the dominion and the majesty of kingdoms under all the heavens shall be given to the people of the saints of the most high, whose kingdom is the kingdom of an age; and all dominions shall worship him and obey (Dan. 7:13–14, 27). “The son of man” means the Lord as to the Divine human and as to the Word. That a church is to be established by him that will worship him is meant by the words, “there was given him dominion and glory and a kingdom, and his dominion is the dominion of an age, which shall not pass away”; and the church"

This end is meant by the end of Babylon. Not that the idolatrous worship of such in the world will be destroyed and themselves with it, for this will remain, but not as the worship of any church, but as the worship of paganism; consequently such after death will come among pagans, and be no longer among Christians. But from those who have adored the Lord, and not the pope or saints or graven images, a new church will be gathered up by the Lord. [9] The Babylonish idolatry is described in Daniel: By the high statue which king Nebuchadnezzar set up and which he decreed all should fall down to and adore; and those who did not should be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace (Dan. 3:1–7). This idolatry is described also in the same: By the statute that Darius the Mede decreed, that no one should ask any petition from any god or from any man, but from the king; and that whosoever should ask anything from god or from man within thirty days, should be cast into a den of lions (Dan. 6:7–9). By this “Babel” or “Babylon” is depicted as to dominion over holy things, and the assumption of Divine authority; and the destruction of such is described by all who persuaded Darius to make that statute being cast into the den of lions and devoured. [10] Babylon is described also in Daniel: By Belshazzar the king, his nobles, his wives, and his concubines, drank wine out of the vessels of gold and silver that Nebuchadnezzar his father had brought from the temple of Jerusalem, and at the same time they praised the gods of gold and silver, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, and then the writing on the wall appeared to him; after which the king was slain that same night (Dan. 5:1 to the end)."

From these passages in Daniel it can be seen that “Babylon” or “Babel” means in the Word the love of dominion over the entire globe, likewise over heaven and over the Lord himself, and that the church of the Lord successively becomes Babylon, and that as it becomes Babylon so it is devastated as to all the good of love and all the truth of faith; and that this is its end, that is, it is no longer a church; and when it is no longer a church it is reckoned among the idolatrous nations, except those in it who worship the Lord, regard the Word as holy, and admit instruction from it. 1029d.

And I will break the Assyrian in my land, and upon my mountains will I trample him (Isa. 14:1–25). All this is said of Babylon, and not of any devil who was created an angel of light, and became a rebel and was cast into hell, and from his first state was called “Lucifer, son of the dawn.” That Babylon is here described is evident from the fourth and twenty-second verses of this chapter, where the king of Babylon and Babylon are mentioned, for it is said, “Thou shalt declare this parable concerning the king of Babylon,” and afterwards, “I will cut off from Babylon name and remnant.” It is to be known that a king has a like signification in the Word as his kingdom. Babylon is called “Lucifer, son of the dawn,” because, as has been said above, Babylon in the beginning is the church that is in zeal for the Lord, for the good of love, and for the truths of faith, although inwardly in the zeal of its pastors lies hidden the fire of dominating by means of the holy things of the church over all whom they can subdue to themselves. This is why Babylon is called “Lucifer, son of the dawn.” For the same reason it is called: King of kings, into whose hand all things are given (Dan. 2:37); The head of the statue which was gold (Dan. 2:38); A tree in the midst of the earth, great in height (Dan. 4:10, 22).

Now as Babylon in its beginning signifies such a church, the king of Babylon is here called “Lucifer, son of the dawn,” “Lucifer” because of the light of truth at that time, and “son of the dawn” because of the beginning of light or of day, for “dawn” means the church in its beginning. But this chapter describes this church as to its state even to the end, when it has become “Babylon the harlot,” which is its state when there is no longer any good of love nor any truth of faith left. This state of it is what is meant by its destruction and condemnation to hell. Their destruction in the world means nothing else than that after death hell is for those who have arrogated to themselves the Divine authority, and have exercised it, and to that end have held the peoples of the earth in dense thick darkness or blindness, and in idolatrous worship; especially those who have led men away from the worship of the Lord. [13] As these are the things described in this chapter I will explain briefly the passages quoted from it. “Jehovah will have compassion on Jacob, and will again choose Israel, that he may set him upon their own land” signifies a new church to be established by the Lord after the end of Babylon. “In that day thou shalt declare this parable concerning the king of Babylon, and say, How hath the exactor ceased, the lust for gold ceased” signifies deliverance from the spiritual captivity and servitude in which those were who were under its dominion. “Jehovah hath broken the staff of the wicked, the rod of those having dominion” signifies that they no longer have any power by means of truths from good, because they are in mere falsities from evil; such is their impotence in the spiritual world. “The whole earth is quiet; they have broken forth into singing, even the oaks rejoice on account of thee, the"

Art thou become like unto us? Thy magnificence is brought down into hell, the noise of thy psalteries” signifies such delight on this account that the church has become like them, and is likewise in the falsities of evil. “How hast thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning, thou hast been cut down to the earth, thou hast been weakened below the nations” signifies derision because of its having become such, although in the beginning it was in heaven, because in the good of love and in the truths of faith. This was said by those who are in hell, because to those in hell nothing is more delightful than to be able to draw one down from heaven and destroy him by falsities of evil. “And thou hast said in thine heart, I will exalt my throne above the stars of heaven, and I will sit on the mount of assembly, on the sides of the north, I will ascend above the heights of the cloud, I will become like the most high,” are also words of derision respecting their pride of dominion, that they spread out even to heaven, and arrogate to themselves the Divine authority, and thus subject all things of heaven and all things of the church to their will, to the end that they may be worshiped and adored as gods, “the mount of assembly on the sides of the north” being where there is ascent into the heavens, “over the stars and over the heights of the cloud” being over the Divine truth, “stars” being the knowledges of good and truth, and “heights of the cloud” the interior truths of the Word. “Yet in truth thou hast been brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit; they that see thee consider thee.

This entire chapter treats of the total devastation of all things of good and all things of truth of the church, with those who are of Babylon. “So shall Babylon be” means in the sense of the letter the great city called Babylon; but in the spiritual sense it means the church that has become Babylon. Babylon is called “the ornament of kingdoms and the adornment of the magnificence of the Chaldeans,” because of the wisdom of that church in its beginning, as has been said before; but in general “Babel” or “Babylon” means the church in which all the goods of love have been destroyed and finally profaned, and “Chaldea” the church in which all the truths of faith are destroyed and finally profaned; and this is why it is said “as God’s overthrowing Sodom and Gomorrah,” “Sodom” also signifying the destruction of all good by the love of self, and “Gomorrah” the destruction of all truth therefrom. “It shall not be inhabited forever, it shall not be dwelt in even from generation to generation” signifies its destruction to eternity, “not to be inhabited forever” relating to the destruction of good, and “not to be dwelt in from generation to generation” relating to the destruction of truth; for those who destroy good and truth and afterwards embrace in place of these evil and falsity cannot be reformed. It is otherwise with those who are in evils and falsities but have not destroyed good and truth, as are the Gentiles that have no knowledge of good and truth. “The Arabian shall not abide there, and the shepherds shall not make to lie down” signifies that the church will become such a desert, “the Arabian” meaning one who lives in a desert, but does not abide there, because there is no corn or fruit; and it is the same with the flocks of shepherds when there is no pasture. “The ijim3 shall lie down there, and the houses shall be full of ochim” signifies the infernal falsities and evils pertaining to them, “ijim” meaning infernal falsities, and “ochim” infernal evils, and “house” the mind of those who are such. “The daughters of the owl shall lie down there, and the satyrs shall dance there” signifies that falsified truths and adulterated goods shall be there, “daughters of the owl” meaning falsified truths, and “satyrs” adulterated goods, and “to dance” meaning the joy from filthy love which has adulterated the good of love. “The ijim shall answer in her palaces, and dragons in"

[15] Babylon is likewise described in other passages in the prophets. As in Jeremiah: O sword against Babylon, a sword against her treasures, that they may be spoiled; a drought upon her waters, that they may be dried up; for it is a land of graven images, and they glory in horrible things; therefore the ziim with the ijim shall dwell there, and the daughters of the owl shall dwell therein; she shall not sit anymore forever, nor shall she be inhabited even from generation to generation; according to God’s overthrowing Sodom and Gomorrah, and its neighboring cities, not a man shall dwell there, neither shall a son of man tarry therein (Jer. 50:35, 37–40). Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and deliver a man his soul, lest ye be cut off for her iniquity. Babylon is a cup of gold in the hand of Jehovah, making the whole earth drunken; the nations have drunk of her wine, therefore the nations are mad. Babylon is fallen suddenly, and is broken in pieces. Behold I am against thee, O destroying mountain, saith Jehovah, destroying the whole earth. And I will stretch out my hand against thee, to roll thee down from the rocks, and to make thee a mountain of burning. And they shall not take from thee a stone for a corner. Babylon shall become heaps, a habitation of dragons, an astonishment and a hissing, without inhabitant (Jer. 51:6–8, 25, 26, 37). In Isaiah: Hear now, O Babylon, sitting securely, saying in her heart, I and none like me besides; I shall not sit a widow, neither shall I know bereavement. But these two things shall come to thee in a moment, in one day, bereavement and widowhood. They shall come upon thee fully because of the multitude of thy sorceries and the great abundance of thine enchantments. For thou hast trusted in thy wickedness, saying, No one seeth me. Thy wisdom and thy knowledge hath seduced thee, when thou hast said in thy heart, I and none like me besides. Therefore evil shall come upon thee which thou knowest not how to ward off, and calamity shall fall upon thee which thou shall not be able to expiate; and devastation shall come upon thee suddenly which thou knewest not (Isa. 47:8–11)."

Again, the adulteration of good and the falsification of truth by the Jews is described by their whoredoms in Egypt, and afterwards with the daughters of Assyria, and finally with the daughters of Babylon and with the Chaldeans (Ezek. 16:1 to the end; 23:1 to the end). “Whoredom in Egypt” means falsification of truth from the natural man, which is effected by fallacies, appearances, and knowledges. Their whoredom with the daughters of Assyria signifies falsification of truth from the rational man, which is effected by reasonings and sophistries from fallacies, appearances, and knowledges. Their whoredom with the daughters of Babylon and with the Chaldeans signifies the adulteration of good and the profanation of truth. [16] When, therefore, the sons of Israel wholly departed from the statutes which were representative of the spiritual things of the church, through which they had communication with heaven, they were all given into the hands of the king of Assyria; for there was no longer with them any representative church and consequently no communication with heaven. Respecting their offenses and their being carried away by the king of Assyria into his cities, and also into Babylon, see 2 Kings 17:1 to the end. The same thing happened to the Jews. When they had adulterated and profaned all the statutes, judgments, and laws that represented good and truth of faith, to the extent that there was no longer anything of good and truth left, and when their church thus became Babylon, then not only their kings and princes and the whole people, but also all the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and afterwards all its golden vessels, were given into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon; and moreover the temple itself was burned (respecting this see 2 Kings 24:1–20; 25:1–26; also Isa. 20:17, 18; 39:6, 7; Jer. 20:4, 5; 21:4–10; 25:1–12; 27:6–22; 28:1–16; 29:1–21; 32:1–5; 34:1–7, 18–22; 35:11; 38:17–23; 39:2–18; 41:1–12; 52:1 to the end).

All these signify the profanation of the holy things of the church. Such profanation is signified also by “Babylon.” That the land, therefore, which signified the church might no longer be profaned by them, and also that Babylon might thus fully put on its representation, it was said to them by Jeremiah that they should surrender themselves voluntarily into the hands of the king of Babylon, and those who did not surrender themselves, but remained in the land, should die by the sword, famine, and pestilence (Jer. 25:1–11). [17] But since the Lord was to be born in that nation and make himself manifest where the church then was and where his Word was, so that nation after a captivity of seventy years was brought back from Babylon, and the temple was rebuilt. And yet no other church remained with them except a church like that called Babylon, as can be seen from many things which the Lord himself said about that nation, and from the way they received him; and for this reason Jerusalem was again destroyed, and the temple burnt with fire. [18] It is to be known in general that every church in its beginning is like a virgin, but in process of time it becomes a harlot. For it enters gradually into a life of evil and thus embraces a doctrine of falsity, as gradually it begins to love self and the world; and then from being a church it becomes either Babylon or Philistia, Babylon with those who love self above all things, and Philistia with those who love the world above all things. For as these two loves increase, the men of the church adulterate and falsify the goods and truths of the Word, which is from being a virgin to become a harlot.

Verses 1–2. And there came one of the seven angels that had the seven vials and spoke with me, saying unto me, Come, I will show thee the judgment of the great harlot that sitteth upon many waters, with whom the kings of the earth committed whoredom; and they that dwell on the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her whoredom. 1. “And there came one of the seven angels that had the seven vials and spoke with me” signifies a manifestation of the state of the church with the Papists (n. 1031); “saying unto me, Come, I will show thee the judgment of the great harlot” signifies the religious persuasion of those in whom all the good and truth of the church has been adulterated and profaned (n. 1032); “that sitteth upon many waters” signifies that has dominion over all things of the Word, and thus over the holy things of the church (n. 1033). 2. “With whom the kings of the earth committed whoredom” signifies that it has falsified all the truths of the church (n. 1034); “and they that dwell on the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her whoredom” signifies that from falsifications those who are of the church have become insane (n. 1035). 1031. Verse 1. And there came one of the seven angels that had the seven vials and spoke with me, signifies a manifestation of the state of the church with the Papists.

Saying unto me, Come, I will show thee the judgment of the great harlot, signifies the religious persuasion of those in whom all the good and truth of the church has been adulterated and profaned. This is evident from the signification of “judgment,” as being all that concerns their religious persuasion, and finally its condemnation. Also from the signification of “the great harlot,” as being the adulteration and profanation of the good and truth of the church (see above, n. 141b, 161, 717d, 881). This is the meaning of “the great harlot” because by her Babylon is meant, as is evident from the fifth verse of this chapter, where it is said, “Upon the forehead” of the harlot “a name written, Mystery, Babylon the great, the mother of the whoredoms and abominations of the earth”; and “Babylon” signifies the adulteration and profanation of good and truth (as has been fully shown above in article 1029). [2] Babylon is called “the great harlot” and “the mother of the whoredoms and abominations of the earth,” because a love of having dominion over all things of the world, and still further, over all things of heaven and the church, and finally over the Lord himself, cannot do otherwise than wholly change Divine truths into falsities and Divine goods into evils, thus the church into a religious persuasion in which all its good and truth is adulterated and profaned. For by that love a man wholly turns himself away from the Lord, and turns only towards self; and thus he can no longer be led by the Lord, but is led by what is his own [proprium]; and to be led by what is his own is to be led by hell. Man is either led from heaven or he is led from hell; he cannot be led by both at the same time; and he is led from heaven when he is led by the Lord, and from hell when he is led by self. For man was so created as to be capable of being raised above what is his own and of thinking in that elevated state.

This is effected by an elevation above what is his own; and when man thinks in that elevated state he thinks truth from the Lord and does good from him. [3] The opposite comes to pass when a man strives to gain dominion over the world, over heaven, and over the Lord; for he then immerses the interiors of his mind which belong to his thought and will in what is his own; and when a man is immersed in what is his own he thinks and wills from hell; consequently he thinks and wills falsities and evils; and for the reason that what is man’s own is nothing but evil, for it is his inherited evil itself. Such then are the Babylonians; and therefore they have adulterated and profaned all the goods and truths of the church; and this is why Babylon is called a “harlot,” and “the mother of the whoredoms and abominations of the earth.” 1033. That sitteth upon many waters, signifies that has dominion over all things of the Word, and thus over the holy things of the church. This is evident from the signification of “to sit,” as being to subject to her judgment and to bring under her jurisdiction, and thus to have dominion over. This is why the expressions “sitting in judgment” and “sitting upon a throne” are used (see above, n. 687). Also from the signification of “waters,” as being truths (see n. 71, 483, 518, 854), but here all things of the Word, because it is said “many waters,” and has reference to the “harlot,” which is Babylon, by which is meant adulteration and profanation of the Word from which comes every good and truth of the church. “Many waters” signify also the holy things of the church, because all holy things of the church have reference to goods and truths, which are from the Word.

O thou that dwellest upon many waters, upon many treasures, thine end is come, the measure of thy gain (Jer. 51:12–13). Because “many waters” signify the truths of the Word, and thus the holy things of the church, it is here added, “upon many treasures”; for “treasures” signify Divine truths, which are in the Word. “Many waters” here signify also the holy things of the church, as will be evident from the explanation of the fifteenth verse, where it is said, “The waters which thou sawest, where the harlot sitteth, are peoples and multitudes, nations and tongues,” and “peoples, multitudes, nations, and tongues,” there mean all things of the church; because the “earth” in the Word signifies the church, and thus those on the earth signify all things of the church. But on this more will be said in the explanation of that verse. That the Babylonians have subjected the truths of the Word and the holy things of the church to their judgment, jurisdiction, and dominion, can be seen from this, that they persuade the people that the Word is understood by them alone and not by any who have not been inaugurated into the ministry; and by this means they subject all things of the Word and thus all things of the church to their dominion. [3] Moreover, the Word is such in the sense of its letter that it may be drawn aside to confirm any heresy whatever; for the sense of the letter consists of appearances of truth, which hold enclosed in them the genuine truths of heaven, which are called spiritual truths; and unless these truths are revealed and laid bare, that is, unless they are taught in the doctrines of the church, the appearances they present may be drawn over and perverted to favor any falsity whatever, and even to favor evil. For the genuine truths of the Word are like a man, and the appearances of truth, of which the sense of the letter consists, are like his garments, from which alone no judgment can be formed respecting who the man is or what he is. If a man were judged from his garments alone, a king might be called a servant, and a servant a king, and a good man might be called an evil man, and an evil man a good man; and so on.

And this is an easy task, because all things of the church, which are called holy, they place above the human understanding, and when this is assented to and no genuine truth is taught, infernal falsities may be called truths, and devilish evils may be called goods; and the simple may even be persuaded that the edicts of the pope are just as holy as the commandments of the Word, and even more holy; and yet these are from heaven, while those edicts are for the most part from hell. For every edict respecting government, faith, and worship in the church, that has for an end dominion in the world, however it may appear in the external form, and may sound as if from the Word, is from hell; while every commandment from the Word, because it has for its end the salvation of souls by the Lord, is from heaven. From all this it can be seen that “sitting upon many waters,” when predicated of Babylon as a harlot, signifies having dominion over all things of the Word, and thus over the holy things of the church. 1034. Verse 2. With whom the kings of the earth committed whoredom, signifies that they have falsified all the truths of the church. This is evident from the signification of “committing whoredom,” as being to falsify (see n. 141, 161, 817c, 881); also from the signification of “the kings of the earth,” as being the truths of the church, “kings” being truths, and the “earth” the church. “Kings” are mentioned in many places in the Word, and it is supposed that kings or their kingdoms are thereby meant; but in the Word “kings” mean all who are in truths from good from the Lord, and in an abstract sense, in which is the spiritual sense, they mean truths from good. That this is the meaning of “kings” may be seen above (n. 29, 31, 553, 624e, 625). This can be further seen from the following in Revelation: Jesus Christ, the Prince of the kings of the earth, who hath made us kings and priests (Rev. 1:5–6). The lamb made us kings and priests, that we might reign upon the earth (Rev. 5:10; likewise 16:12, 14)."

The ten horns that thou sawest are ten kings (Rev. 17:12). The woman is the great city which hath kingship over the kings of the earth (Rev. 17:18). So, too, in a subsequent passage, where it is said: That the beast, the kings of the earth, and their armies, made war with him that sat on the white horse (Rev. 19:19). All this makes clear the signification of the words “the kings of the earth committed whoredom with the harlot that sitteth upon many waters,” namely, that the truths of the church have been falsified by those who are of Babylon. So again in a subsequent passage, where it is said that: The kings of the earth committed whoredom with that woman, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich from the abundance of her delicacies. The kings of the earth, who have committed whoredom and lived deliciously with her, shall weep and lament over her (Rev. 18:3, 9, 11). “Kings” have a like signification in Daniel: As for the ten horns of the fourth beast, out of this kingdom ten kings shall arise; and another shall arise after them, and he shall be diverse from the former, and he shall put down three kings (Dan. 7:24).

(That the “earth” in the Word signifies the church, has been frequently shown above.) From all this it is clear that “they that dwell on the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her whoredom” signifies that from falsifications those who are of that church have become insane. [2] In regard to the insanity that is signified in the Word by “intoxication” and “drunkenness,” it is not from falsities but from truths falsified, for the reason that truth from heaven acts into the understanding, and at the same time falsity from hell; and this gives rise to dissension in the mind, and to an insanity like that of a drunkard in the world. But only those are subject to this insanity who are in evil, and who have confirmed falsities of evil by means of the Word; for all things of the Word are truths and communicate with heaven, while falsities of evil are from hell. But from falsities that are not from evil there is no spiritual intoxication, for such falsities do not pervert and destroy the spiritual truths that lie hidden within the truths of the sense of the letter, since from falsities not from evil, they cannot produce evil, as they can by falsities from evil."

Verse 3. And he carried me away in the spirit into a wilderness, signifies into a place appearing in vision that corresponded to the state of that religious persuasion. This is evident from the signification of “wilderness,” as being a state of the church in which there is no longer any good or truth (see n. 730). But as a church in which there is no longer any good or truth is not a church, it is called a religious persuasion. Also from the signification of “in the spirit,” as being in vision, for what John saw in the spirit he saw in vision. To see in vision is to see such things as exist with angels in heaven, which are representative and thus significative of things spiritual. When these appear to man they do not appear before the sight of his body, but before the sight of his spirit. For the spirit of man has eyes as well as his body; but the eyes of his spirit see the things that are in the spiritual world, because all things that appear there are from a spiritual origin, and the spiritual man sees spiritual things with the understanding, and with the eyes he sees the same in a form like the natural. But the eyes of the body see the things that are in the material world, because all things that appear there are from a natural origin; and with his understanding the material man sees natural things, while with his eyes he sees the same in a material form. So when the eyes of the spirit were opened with the prophets they saw such things as represented and thus signified the celestial Divine and spiritual Divine things of the church, and sometimes such things as represented and thus signified things that were to come to pass in the churches in the future; and such were the things that John saw. He now saw a wilderness, because a “wilderness” signifies a state of the church devastated of all good and truth; and this state corresponds to the church that had become Babylon. This is why"

And I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet beast, signifies the dominion of that religious persuasion over the holy things of the Word.

That Babylon is meant by this “woman” is clearly evident from the fifth verse of this chapter. Also from the signification of “sitting,” as being to have dominion (see just above, n. 1033); also from the signification of “a scarlet beast,” as being the Word as to the holy things of it, which the woman that is Babylon had profaned by dominion over them. That “the scarlet beast” signifies the Word as to the holy things of it that have been profaned by Babylon can be seen from what follows in this chapter, where it is said that “it was and is not, and is about to come up out of the abyss and to go into perdition” (verses 8–11); and afterwards, that “the ten horns of the beast were ten kings, who hated the harlot, and would make her desolate and naked, and would eat her flesh, and burn her up with fire, and would give the kingdom unto the beast” (verses 12, 16, 17). From these words viewed in the spiritual sense it is clear that “the scarlet beast” signifies the Word as to the holy things of it.

And the four beasts, or four animals, that also were cherubim, were seen by John sitting and standing before the throne (Rev. 4:6–10; 5:6–12; 7:11; 14:3). And these as cherubim signify providence and protection that the Lord be not approached except by the good of love, and thus also they signify the Word in the letter, since that protects (see above, n. 277, 278a, 717c). Moreover, all beasts that were sacrificed, as oxen, bullocks, goats, she-goats, kids, rams, sheep, and lambs, signified the holy things of the church (as can be seen from what has been shown above, n. 279, 283, 362, 552, 650a, g, 781d, 817d, e). And this is why men because of charity are called “sheep,” and even the Lord himself because of the Divine innocence is called a “lamb,” and because of the Divine power is called a “lion.” This has been said that it may not seem strange that the “beast” here signifies the Word, but the Word in the letter, where it is natural. Also, in a general sense, “beast” signifies in the Word the natural as to affection. The beast appeared scarlet in color, because “scarlet” signifies truth from a celestial origin, such as the truth of the Word is in the sense of its letter, that is, in its natural sense, which is what is meant by its holiness. Nearly the same is signified by “the harlot seen sitting upon many waters” (in the first verse of this chapter), also “upon many treasures” (in Jer. 51:13). For “many waters” and “many treasures” there signify the truths of the Word, and thus the holy things of the church which have been adulterated (see above, n. 1033). The signification of “scarlet” will be seen in the explanation of the following verse. 1039. Full of names of blasphemy, signifies which are adulterated and falsified. This is evident from the signification of “name,” as being what a thing is or what a state is (see n. 102, 148, 676, 695b, 841); therefore “full of names” signifies what the holy things of the Word were to it; also from the signification of “blasphemy,” in reference to the Word, as being its adulteration and falsification (see n. 778)."

And as these heads were the heads of the scarlet beast, which signifies the Word as to its holy things (see above, n. 1038), and seven of them were seen, so “the seven heads” signify the holy things of the Word profaned, for the number “seven” signifies what is holy, and in the contrary sense what is profane. In the sense nearest to the letter “the head” of this beast signifies the Word as to the understanding of it, and thus as to the intelligence and wisdom in it and from it. But when its truths and goods, from which intelligence and wisdom come, have been falsified and adulterated, its “heads,” when seven were seen, signify the holy things of the Word profaned. That this is the signification of “the seven heads” is evident also from the ninth and tenth verses of this chapter, where it is said, “The seven heads are seven mountains, where the woman sitteth upon them, and they are seven kings,” which signifies profanation of the good of love and of the truth of faith. 1041. And ten horns, signifies the power of the Word from truths. This is evident from the signification of “horns,” as being the power of truth against falsity; and in the contrary sense the power of falsity against truth (see n. 316, 567, 776); here the power of truth from the Word against falsity, because it is said in what follows: The ten horns that thou sawest are ten kings. These shall hate the harlot, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her up with fire. And God gave into their hearts to give their kingdom unto the beast (Rev. 17:12, 16–17). This makes clear that “the ten horns” that the scarlet beast had signify the power of truth, thus of the Word, against falsities; for it is said that they “will hate the harlot and will burn her up with fire,” and the “harlot” signifies the truth of the Word falsified, which in itself is falsity, and this can be hated and burned up only by the truth of the Word in its power, thus by those who are in truths from the Word, and who think of the Word alone as holy,"

This is evident from the signification of the “woman,” as being the religious persuasion of the Papists; also from the signification of “arrayed,” as being what it is in externals, for “garments” are external things that clothe; therefore “to be arrayed” means the appearance in externals. Also from the signification of “purple,” as being good from a celestial origin, and also the evil opposite thereto, which is called devilish evil (of which presently). Also from the signification of “scarlet,” as being truth from a celestial origin, and also the falsity opposite thereto, which is called devilish falsity.

So in other passages. Babylon is here described as a harlot appears in the world, splendidly clothed and yet abominable, because full of uncleanness. [3] Before proving from the Word that “purple and scarlet” signify goods and truths from a celestial origin, something shall be said about such goods and truths. The Divine good that proceeds from the Lord is united with his Divine truth, as heat from the sun is with light in the time of spring. But the angels, who are recipients of the Divine good and Divine truth proceeding from the Lord, are distinguished into celestial and spiritual. Those who receive more of the Lord’s Divine good than of his Divine truth are called celestial angels; because these constitute the kingdom of the Lord that is called the celestial kingdom. But the angels who receive more of the Lord’s Divine truth than of his Divine good are called spiritual angels, because the Lord’s spiritual kingdom consists of these. This makes clear that goods and truths have a twofold origin, namely, a celestial origin and a spiritual origin. Those goods and truths that are from a celestial origin are the goods and truths of love to the Lord; while those goods and truths that are from a spiritual origin are the goods and truths of love towards the neighbor. The difference is like that between higher and lower, or between interior and exterior; thus like that between things that are in a higher or interior degree, and those that are in a lower or exterior degree; and what this difference is can be seen from what has been said in Heaven and Hell about the three degrees of the heavens, and thus of the angels, and of their wisdom and intelligence (n. 33–34, 38–39, 208–209, 211, 435)."

As in Ezekiel: Fine linen of embroidered work from Egypt was thy spreading forth, blue and purple from the isles of Elishah was thy covering (Ezek. 27:7). This is said of Tyre, which signifies the church as to the knowledges of truth and good, “blue and purple” standing for such knowledges from a celestial origin, and “covering and spreading forth” signifying the externals of that church. In Luke: There was a certain rich man, who was clothed in purple and fine linen and indulged in delicacies every day (Luke 16:19). The “rich man” means the Jewish nation and the church therein, which was called “rich” from the knowledges of good and truth from the Word that they had, “in purple” meaning the knowledges of good, and “in fine linen” the knowledges of truth, both from a celestial origin. In Lamentations: They that did eat delicacies are laid waste in the streets; they that were brought up in scarlet have embraced a dunghill (Lam. 4:5). “To be brought up in scarlet” means to be instructed from infancy in truths from celestial good. [5] As the Tent of meeting represented heaven, and the garments of Aaron represented the holy things of heaven, and purple and scarlet signify the goods and truths of heaven, so the curtains and veils of the Tent, as well as the garments of Aaron, were wrought with blue, purple, scarlet double-dyed, and fine linen woven together; as: The curtains of the habitation (Exod. 26:1); The veil before the ark (Exod. 26:31);"

And for the same reason it was a custom in ancient times, when significatives were in use, to tie a scarlet cord as a reminder or remembrance of a thing, as is said of Perez the son of Tamar, that: The midwife tied scarlet upon his hand (Gen. 38:28, 30);"

And scarlet was used for the waters of separation and expiation from a red heifer (Num. 19:6). Purple and scarlet derive their signification from the nature of these colors. For there are colors in heaven far more brilliant than in the world, originating from the light there; and as red has its origin there from what is fiery or flame-like, and what is fiery and flame- like has its origin there from the good of love, so “purple” signifies good from a celestial origin. But scarlet derives its color from what is flame-like and at the same time glistening, and glistening from light signifies truth; consequently that color signifies the truth of celestial good. [8] As most things in the Word have a contrary sense, so have purple and scarlet; and in that sense they signify the evils and falsities opposite to those goods and truths. As in Isaiah: Although your sins have been as scarlet they shall become white like snow; although they have been red as purple they shall be as wool (Isa. 1:18). Since “scarlet,” the same as “snow” signifies truth, and “purple,” the same as “wool” signifies good, and since “scarlet and purple” signify in the contrary sense falsity and evil (falsity and truth, and evil and good corresponding by opposition), so it is said “Although your sins have been as scarlet they shall become white like snow, and although they have been red as purple they shall be as wool.”"

These dominions are distinguished in the Word by the names devil and satan. There are two dominions in the hells, because the heavens and the hells are opposite to each other; and opposite must fully correspond to opposite that there may be equilibrium. For the existence and subsistence of all things, both in the natural world and in the spiritual world, depend upon an exact equilibrium between two activities that are opposite; and when these act against each other manifestly, they act by forces, but when not manifestly they act by endeavors [conatus]. By means of equilibriums all things in both worlds are preserved; without this all things would perish. In the spiritual world the equilibrium is between good from heaven and evil from hell; and thus between truth from heaven and falsity from hell. For the Lord continually arranges that all kinds and species of good and truth in the heavens shall have opposite to them in the hells evils and falsities of kinds that correspond by opposition; thus goods and truths from a celestial origin have for their opposites evils and falsities that are called devilish; and in like"

All angels, spirits, and men are kept by the Lord in equilibrium between good and evil, and thus between truth and falsity, in order that they may be in freedom; and thus may be led from evil to good and from falsity to truth easily and as if by themselves, although in fact they are led by the Lord.

And as a “cup” signifies truth or falsity, and the doctrine of every church is either of truth or of falsity, for all truth or falsity of the church is contained in doctrine, so a “cup” also signifies doctrine, and “a golden cup” the doctrine of falsity from evil."

It is called “a golden cup” for the same reason that the woman is said to be “arrayed in purple and scarlet, and inwrought with gold, precious stones and pearls,” that is, from the appearance in externals; and yet in internals it is like a cup “full of abominations and uncleanness.” For it is like what the Lord says of the externals and internals with the scribes and Pharisees: Woe unto you scribes and Pharisees, who cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess. And ye make yourselves like unto whited sepulchers, which outwardly appear beautiful, but within are full of bones of the dead and all uncleanness (Matt. 23:25–27). The above is evident also from the signification of “abominations,” as being the profanations of good (of which presently); also from the signification of “the uncleanness of whoredom,” as being the profanation of truth. For “whoredom” signifies falsification of truth (see above), therefore its “uncleanness” signifies profanation. [3] In regard to the profanations that are signified by “abominations,” they are perversions of the holy things of the church, thus conversions of its goods into evils, and of its truths into falsities. They are called “abominations” because the angels abominate them; for so far as they have been holy things of the church, derived from goods and truths from the Word, they ascend into heaven; but so far as they have been applied to evils, and thus profaned, they carry with them what is infernal, which lies hidden within; and consequently they are perceived as things dead, in which there was once a living soul; and this is why heaven abominates and detests them. [4] That this is the meaning of “abominations” in the Word is evident from the account of the abominations of Jerusalem in Ezekiel:"

(Ezek. 16:2–63). All these things signify profanations of the Word, of the church, and of worship. So in other passages where abominations are either recounted or mentioned (as Jer. 7:9, 10; 16:18; 32:35; Ezek. 5:11; 7:19, 20; 8:6–18; 11:21; 14:6; 20:7, 8; Deut. 7:25, 26; 12:31; 18:9, 10; Matt. 24:15; Mark 13:14; Dan. 9:27; 11:31; and elsewhere). 1046.

And upon her forehead a name written, Mystery, Babylon the great, signifies having in heart a love of dominion over the world and heaven, which the holy things of the Word, of the church, and of worship are made to serve as means. This is evident from the signification of “a name written upon the forehead,” as being what she is as to love, for “name” signifies what a thing or a state is, and “forehead” signifies love. That “name” means what a thing or a state is may be seen n. 102, 148, 676, 695b, 841, 892; and that “forehead” corresponds to the good of love, n. 427a, 852a. Also from the signification of “mystery,” as being that which lies hidden in the heart and is not evident to the common people. That this is the love of dominion over the world and over heaven, which the holy things of the church are made to serve as means, and that the cupidity and government of that love is Babylon, has been fully shown in the introduction to this chapter (n. 1029). And as that love devastates the church of all truths and goods, that devastation is also meant by “Mystery, Babylon the great.”"

This is evident from the signification of “mother,” as being the church, but here a religious persuasion which in the general sense is meant by “Babylon”; also from the signification of “whoredoms,” as being adulterations of good and falsifications of truth (see n. 141, 161, 817c, 881); also from the signification of “abominations,” as being profanations (see n. 1045); also from the signification of the “earth,” as being the church, here as to its holy things.

The most grievous kind is when one acknowledges and lives according to the truths and goods of the Word, of the church, and of worship, and afterwards denies them and lives contrary to them, or even lives contrary to them and does not deny them. Such profanation effects a conjunction and coherence of good with falsity, and of truth with evil, and from this it comes to pass that man is at the same time in heaven and in hell; consequently, when heaven wills to have its own, and hell wills to have its own, and yet they cohere, they are both swept away, and thus the proper human life perishes, and the man becomes like a brute animal, continually delirious, and carried hither and thither by fantasy like a dragon in the air, and in his fantasy shreds and specks appear like giants and crowds, and a little platter like the universe; and so on.

And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus; and when I saw her I wondered with great wonder. 6. “And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints” signifies a religious persuasion that is insane from the falsities of evil, from which violence is done to Divine truths (n. 1049); “and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus” signifies violence done to those truths of the Word that teach that the Lord alone is to be adored (n. 1050); “and when I saw her I wondered with great wonder” signifies an astonishing vision in which were arcana of heaven, that were unknown to him (n. 1051). 1049. Verse 6. And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, signifies a religious persuasion that is insane from falsities of evil, from which violence is done to Divine truths. This is evident from the signification of “the woman,” as being the religious persuasion that is meant in a general sense by “Babylon” (as above, n. 1042); also from the signification of “to be drunken,” as meaning to be insane in spiritual things from falsities of evil (see above, n. 376f, 1035); also from the signification of “the blood of the saints,” as being Divine truths, here violence done to them, because it is meant that the blood was shed. (That “blood” signifies the Divine truth may be seen n. 30, 328a, 329, 476, 748; and that “shedding blood” signifies violence done to Divine truth, n. 329f, g.) It is said “the blood of the saints,” because the Divine truths of the Word are what are called holy, and because by “saints” in the spiritual sense saints are not meant, but things holy; for in the spiritual sense of the Word there is no idea of person, place or time; but it is otherwise with its natural sense. [2] How these two senses differ from each other can be clearly seen in many passages of the Word, as here where it is said that he “saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and the blood of the witnesses or martyrs of Jesus,” and in the natural sense these words mean that Babylon shed the blood of the saints, and the blood of those who bore witness to the Lord; while in the"

That this sense is contained in these words can also be seen or concluded from this, that the modern Babylon has not slain the saints nor the witnesses of the Lord, for it worships saints even to idolatry, and the Lord with supreme though external sanctity, but the pope with internal sanctity; which makes clear that this is not what is to be understood, but that something more interior lies hidden in these words, which is, that they have done violence to Divine truths, and also to the Lord’s Divine authority; for they have done violence to Divine truths by falsifying, adulterating, and profaning the Word; and it is known that they have done violence to the Lord’s Divine authority by transferring it to themselves. (Continuation respecting Profanation) [3] It has been said that the most grievous kind of profanation is when the truths of the Word are acknowledged in faith and confirmed in the life, and man afterwards recedes from faith and lives in evil, or if he does not recede from faith he nevertheless lives in evil. But one who is in faith and in the life according to it from childhood to youth, and afterwards in adult age recedes from faith and from the life of faith, does not profane, for the reason that the faith of childhood is the faith of the memory, and is the master’s faith in the child; while the faith of adult age is the faith of the understanding, and thus man’s own faith. This faith man can profane if he recedes from it and lives contrary to it, but not the former. For nothing enters the life of man and affects it except what comes into the understanding and from that into the will; and man does not think from his own understanding and act from his own will until he arrives at adult age. Before that he has thought merely from knowledge and has acted merely from obedience; and this does not make a part of his life, and therefore cannot be profaned. [4] In a word, whatever a man thinks, speaks, and does from the understanding with the will favoring it, this belongs to his life or comes to be of his life; and if this is holy it is profaned by his"

But the profanations of this kind are more grievous or are lighter according to the quality of the truth and the consequent faith, and according to the quality of the good and the consequent life, and according to the quality of the withdrawal from these; and therefore there are many specific differences in this profanation. 1050. And with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus, signifies violence done to those truths of the Word that teach that the Lord alone is to be adored. This is evident from the signification of “blood,” as being the Divine truth of the Word and violence done to it (as has been said just above); also from the signification of “the witnesses of Jesus,” as being those who in heart acknowledge the Lord, and worship and adore him only. That “to bear witness” means to acknowledge in heart, and that “the testimony of Jesus” means the acknowledgment of the Lord’s Divine in his human, and that he alone is to be worshiped and adored, may be seen (n. 10, 27, 228, 392b–e, 635, 649, 749). That the Babylonians do violence to the truths of the Word that teach about the Lord can be clearly seen from this, that they have transferred the Lord’s Divine authority to the pope as his vicar, and worship and adoration along with it; also with this end in view they have separated the Lord’s Divine from his human, that they might say that they have not assumed his Divine but his human authority; not being willing to know that the Divine authority consists chiefly in the power to save the human race; although the Babylonians appropriate even this power to themselves. But on this more will be said elsewhere. (Continuation respecting Profanation) [2] Why the state of profaners after death is so horrible shall be disclosed. Man has two minds, the natural and the spiritual. The natural mind is opened to him by the knowledges and cognitions of truth and good, and the spiritual mind is opened by a life according to these; and this is effected in those who know, acknowledge, and believe the truths of the Word and live according to them. In others that mind is not opened. When the spiritual mind has been opened, the light of heaven, which is Divine truth, flows through it into the natural mind, and there arranges truths in"

Therefore when a man passes over into a contrary state, and either in faith or life denies the truths of the Word that he has previously acknowledged, the things that are in the natural mind no longer correspond with those that are in the spiritual mind; consequently heaven with its light flows in through the spiritual mind into things that do not correspond, or into things opposite in the natural man; and from this a fantasy arises that is so direful that they seem to themselves to fly in the air like dragons, while shreds and specks appear to them like giants and crowds, and a little ball like the whole globe, and other like things. The reason of this is that they have heaven in the spiritual mind and hell in the natural mind, and when heaven, which is in the spiritual mind, acts into hell, which is in the natural mind, such things appear. And as this destroys all things pertaining to the understanding, and the will with the understanding, the man comes to be no longer a man. And this is why a profaner is no longer called a man, nor he or she, but it, for he is a brute. 1051. And when I saw her I wondered with great wonder, signifies an astonishing vision, in which were arcana of heaven that were unknown to him. This is evident from the signification of “wondering with great wonder” at those things that he saw, as being to be astonished respecting the vision, in which lay hidden arcana unknown to him, therefore the angel said to him, “I will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carrieth her.” (Continuation respecting Profanation) [2] This kind of profanation exists especially with those who acknowledge the Lord and his Divine, and the Word and its holiness; and for the reason that the Lord alone by means of truths from the Word opens heaven to the man who lives according to those truths; and unless heaven is opened such profanation is not possible. And this shows why the Gentiles, who are ignorant of the Lord and know nothing about the Word, cannot bring upon themselves such profanation; neither can the Jews, for they deny the Lord from their infancy, and heaven is not opened to them by means of the Word; neither can the impious who have been such"

(Continuation: the Second Kind of Profanation) [2] There is another kind of profanation of holy things that those come into who have domination as their end, and regard the holy things of the Word, of the church, and of worship, as means. The Divine order is that heaven and the church, and consequently the holy things of these, be the end, and domination the means for promoting that end. For when holy things are the end and domination the means, the Lord is worshiped and adored; but when domination is the end and holy things the means, instead of the Lord man is worshiped and adored. For the means look to the end as servants look to their master, and the end looks to the means as a master looks to his servants; consequently as a master esteems and loves his servants according to the compliance they render to his will, so a man who has domination as his end esteems and loves the holy things of the Word, of the church, and of worship, according to the compliance they render to his end, which is domination. And on the other hand, as a lord despises and dismisses servants and takes others in their place when they are not subservient to his will, so a man who has domination as his end despises and rejects the holy things of the church, and takes other things in their place when they are not subservient to his end, which is domination. [3] From this it is clear that in those who have domination as their end, holy things are of no account except so far as they are subservient to the end, and also that they are not holy, but are profane when they are subservient to this end; and for the reason that the end, when it is domination, is the man himself, and as this end is love of self it is the man’s own [proprium]; and man’s own when viewed in itself is nothing but evil, and indeed is profane, and the end joins to itself the means that they may be as one. In this kind of profanation are all those who are in sacred ministries, and who are seeking by means of the holy things of the church to gain honor and glory, and these and not use, which is the salvation of souls, are what give them joy of heart."

The beast that thou sawest was and is not, signifies that the Word in the beginning was received in the church and read, and afterwards was taken away from the people and not read. This is evident from the signification of “the scarlet beast,” as being the Word in the letter as to its holy things (see n. 1038); also from the signification of “was,” as being that in the beginning it was received in the church and read; also from the signification of “is not,” as being that afterwards it was taken away and not read. That this is the meaning of these words is evident from the fact that the Word was so treated, namely, that in the beginning they acknowledged it as Divine, taught from it, and read it before the people; but that afterwards, as they extended their dominion over the church and over heaven, while they acknowledged it to be Divine they no longer taught from it as before. For they interdicted the people from reading it, and instead of doctrine from it they put forth their doctrine from the Papal throne as Divine, they instituted Divine worship in masses not understood by the common people, and they preached the adoration of the pope and of dead men whom they call saints, instead of the Lord whom they previously adored. All this makes clear that the Word is what is meant by “the scarlet beast, which was and is not, and is about to come up out of the abyss, and go into perdition.” That Babylon in the beginning was a church that worshiped the Lord, and preached the Divine truth from the Word, but afterwards, while it retained an adoration of the Lord it was an external, that is, a formal adoration, and the internal which is the essential adoration they transferred to the pope as the Lord’s vicar, and consequently to the ministering body as vicars under him; this may be seen above (n. 1029). (Continuation respecting the Second Kind of Profanation) [2] Those who are in this kind of profanation cannot do otherwise than adulterate the goods of the Word and falsify its truths, and thus pervert the holy things of the church; for these are not in accord with the end, which is the domination of man over them, for they are Divine things that cannot be mere servants; therefore from necessity, that the means may be in accord with the"

[3] That this is so can be clearly seen from the Babylon of the present day, to which the holy things of the Word, of the church, and of worship, are means, and domination is the end. So far as they have amplified domination they have weakened the holiness of the Word, and have actually exalted above it the holiness of the pope’s decrees; they have claimed to themselves authority over heaven, and even over the Lord himself, and they have instituted the idolatrous worship of men, both living and dead, and this until there is nothing left of Divine good and Divine truth. [4] That the holy things of the Word, of the church, and of worship, have been so changed is of the Lord’s Divine providence; not of his providence that this should be so done, but of his providence that when men wish to have dominion and do have dominion by means of holy Divine things, they should choose falsity in place of truth and evil in place of good, for otherwise they would defile holy things, and render them abominable before angels; but when holy things no longer exist this cannot be done. Take as an example what has been done with the holy supper instituted by the Lord; they have separated the bread and the wine, giving the bread to the people and drinking the wine themselves. For “bread” signifies the good of love to the Lord, and “wine” the truth of faith in him; and good separated from truth is not good, nor is truth separated from good truth, for truth is truth from good, and good is good in truth. And so in other things. 1055. And is about to come up out of the abyss, and go into perdition, signifies that it is acknowledged as Divine for form’s sake, and yet is rejected.

For the Word is acknowledged as Divine on account of the Lord’s words to Peter respecting the keys, on account of the stories of the passion, of Mary, and of the apostles, and some passages which they can pervert to favor their dominion. Since all these are from the Word, and upon these their religion is founded, so if the Word were not acknowledged as Divine the religion itself would fall, and they could no longer rule over holy things, nor even be called Christians. But that the Word, nevertheless, is rejected by them is also known, for it is not read by the common people, and but little by the monks who teach; and many invalidate its holiness, as is evident from their writings and sayings, for the reason that it contains things that are not in accord with the decrees and bulls of the pope, also because Babylon is there described vividly and condemned to hell. These are the causes of its rejection. All this makes clear that the Word is acknowledged as Divine only for form’s sake. And that this is what these words signify can be clearly seen when it is seen that “the scarlet beast” means the Word, and the “harlot or the woman that sitteth upon it” means the religious persuasion that regards dominion as its end, and the holy things of the Word, of the church, and of worship as the means. (Continuation respecting the Second Kind of Profanation) [2] Those who are in the love of self, and from that in the love of having dominion, and who covet, acquire, and afterwards exercise domination by means of the holy things of the Word, of the church, and of worship, are those who profane.

Moreover, this reigns in hell, for in hell everyone wills to be the greatest, while in heaven everyone wills to be the least; and to have dominion over holy things from an infernal delight is to profane them.

For so long as the delight of the love of having dominion resides in man, that mind cannot be opened, and communication with heaven is not possible to him. [4] Moreover, the lot of these profaners after death differs from the lot of the former. The former, as has been said, are in an unceasing delirium of fantasy; but these hate the Lord, hate heaven, hate the Word, hate the church, and hate all its holy things; and they come into such hatred because their dominion is taken away from them, and thus their state is changed into its opposite. They appear like something fiery, and their hell appears like a conflagration; for infernal fire is nothing else than the lust of having dominion from the love of self. These are among the worst, and are called devils; while the others are called satans. 1056. And they that dwell upon the earth shall wonder, signifies those of that religious persuasion who reject the Word. This is evident from the signification of “they that dwell upon the earth,” as being those who are of that religious persuasion; for the “earth” signifies the church, but here a religious persuasion because there is no church, since there is a church only where the Lord is worshiped and the Word is read. That those who reject the Word are meant is clear from what follows, namely, that they are those “whose names have not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world,” and are those “who saw the beast that was and is not, and yet is,” “beast” signifying the Word (as above); therefore they wonder that the Word still is, although it was and is not.

The sensual mind is the first to be opened with man after his birth; after that the natural mind, and as he seeks to become intelligent the rational mind, and as he seeks to become wise the spiritual mind.

And thus they become merely sensual, and are the most stupid of all in things spiritual and thus in things rational, and the most crafty of all in worldly and thus in civil matters. That they are so stupid in spiritual things they do not themselves know, because in heart they do not believe these things, and because they believe craft to be prudence and malice to be wisdom. And yet all of this kind differ according to the kind and extent of their lust of having dominion and of exercising it, also according to the kind and extent of the persuasion that they are holy, and according to the kind of good and truth from the Word that they profane. 1057.

Also from the signification of “from the foundation of the world,” as being from the establishment of the church. In the sense of the letter or the natural sense “the foundation of the world” means the creation of the world; but in the internal spiritual sense it means the establishment of the church; for the spiritual sense treats of spiritual things, while the natural sense treats of natural things which pertain to the world. For this reason the creation of the heaven and the earth in the first chapter of Genesis describes in the spiritual sense the new creation or establishment of the first and most ancient church on this earth. (That this is described by the creation of heaven and earth in the first chapter of Genesis may be seen in Arcana Coelestia, where the contents of that chapter are explained.) Moreover, “to create” signifies in the Word to reform; and “the creator” means the Lord as reformer and savior. (That “to create” signifies to reform, and that the creation of heaven and earth in the first chapter of Genesis in the spiritual sense describes the establishment of the most ancient church can be seen above, n. 294, 739.) [2] The establishment of the church is meant by “the foundation of the world” in these passages in the Word: The king shall say to them on the right hand, Come and possess as an inheritance the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world (Matt. 15:34). Jesus praying said, Father, for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world (John 17:24). Jesus said, The blood of all the prophets shed from the foundation of the world shall be required of this generation (Luke 11:50). That the establishment of the church is meant by “the foundation of the world” is evident from passages in the Word where mention is made of “founding the earth,” “the founding of the earth,” and"

As in Zechariah: Jehovah spreadeth abroad the heavens, and foundeth the earth, and formeth the spirit of man in the midst of him (Zech. 12:1). Here “spreading abroad the heaven and founding the earth,” does not mean the spreading abroad of the visible heaven and the founding of the habitable earth, but the church as to its internals, which are called spiritual, and as to its externals, which are called natural. “To found” this and “to spread abroad” that means to establish; and therefore it is added, “and formeth the spirit of man in the midst of him,” which signifies his reformation and regeneration. [3] In Isaiah: Hearken unto me, O Jacob and Israel, my hand hath founded the earth, and my right hand hath spanned the heavens (Isa. 48:12–13). “Founding the earth with the hand, and spanning the heavens with the right hand,” has a similar signification here as above, as can be seen from what precedes and what follows in this chapter where the establishment of a new church by the Lord is treated of. In the same: Thou hast forgotten Jehovah thy maker, that stretcheth forth the heavens and foundeth the earth (Isa. 51:13). Here again, “the heavens and the earth” signify the church as to its internal or spiritual things and its external or natural things; and “to stretch forth and found” signifies to establish.

Here “to plant the heavens and to found the earth” evidently stands for the establishment of the church; for this is said to the prophet, that “the word should be put in his mouth, and that he should be covered with the shadow of the hand, to plant the heavens and to found the earth”; and a prophet cannot found the earth, but he can found a church; therefore it is also added, “to say unto Zion, thou art my people. Awake, awake, arise, O Jerusalem,” “Zion and Jerusalem,” in the Word, meaning the church. In David: The heaven is thine and the earth is thine; the world and the fullness thereof thou hast founded them (Ps. 89:11). Here too, “heaven and earth” signify the church; “the world” signifies the church as to good, and “the fullness thereof” signifies all the goods and truths of the church. [5] In the same: The earth and the world Jehovah hath founded upon the seas, and established upon the rivers. Who shall ascend into the mountain of Jehovah, and who shall stand in the place of his holiness? (Ps. 24:2–3). The establishment of the church is described by “founding the earth and the world upon the seas, and establishing them upon the rivers,” as can be seen above (n. 304c, 518d, 741b). That the establishment of the church is signified is evident from what here follows, namely, “Who shall ascend into the mountain of Jehovah, and who shall stand in the place of his holiness?” “The mountain of Jehovah” means Zion, which signifies where the Lord reigns by means of the Divine truth, and “the place of his holiness” means Jerusalem, where the temple was, which signifies the church as to doctrine. All this makes clear that “the founding of the world” signifies the establishment of the church. For the “world” has a similar meaning as “heaven and earth”; and the expression “to found the earth” is used because the “earth” signifies the church on earth, and upon this heaven as to its holy things is founded.

In Isaiah: Do ye not know, do ye not hear, hath it not been declared to you from the beginning, do ye not understand the foundations of the earth? (Isa. 40:21). The foundations of the earth are corrupted (Isa. 24:18; likewise 63:12; Jer. 31:37; Micah 6:2; Ps. 18:7, 15; 82:5; and elsewhere). (Continuation respecting the Second Kind of Profanation) [6] Profaners of this kind are stupid and foolish in spiritual things, but are crafty and keen in worldly things, because they make one with the devils in hell; and because, as has been said above, they are merely sensual, and are therefore in what is their own [proprium], which draws its delight of life from the unclean effluvia that exhale from waste matters in the body, and that are emitted from dunghills; and these cause a swelling of their breasts when their pride is active and the titillation of these causes delight. [7] That such is the source of their delight is made evident by their delights after death when they are living as spirits; for then more than the sweetest odors do they love the rank stenches arising from the gases of the belly and from outhouses, which to their smell are more fragrant than thyme. The approach and touch of these close up the interiors of their mind, and open the exteriors pertaining to the body, from which comes their quickness in worldly things, and their dullness in spiritual things. In a word, the love of having dominion by means of the holy things of the church corresponds to filth, and its delight to a stench indescribable by words, and at which angels shudder. Such is the exhalation from their hells when they are opened; but they are kept closed because of the oppression and occasional swooning which they produce. 1058.

When those of this class are in a holy external, and are teaching in a temple or conversing with the common people, they do not know otherwise than that what they say is true; but as soon as they return into themselves they think the opposite. Because these are such they can counterfeit angels of light, although they are angels of darkness. From this it is clear that this kind of profanation is a hypocritical kind. They are not unlike images made of filth and gilded, or like fruits rotten within but with a beautiful skin, or like nuts eaten by worms within but with a whole shell. From all this it is evident that their internal is diabolical, and therefore that their holy external is profane. [3] Such are most of the rulers in the Babylon of the present day, and many of a certain society in Babylon, as those of them know who claim to themselves dominion over the souls of men and over heaven. For to believe as they do, that authority has been given them to save and to admit into heaven, is the very opposite of acknowledging in heart that there is a God, and for the reason that man, in order to be saved and admitted into heaven must look to the Lord and pray to him. But a man who believes that such authority has been given to him looks to himself, and believes the things that are the Lord’s to be in himself; and to believe this, and at the same time to believe that there is a God or that God is in him, is impossible. For a man to believe that God is in him when he thinks himself to be above the holy things of the church, and heaven to be in his power, is like ascribing that belief to Lucifer, who burns with the fire of ruling over all things. If such a man thinks that God is in him he cannot think this otherwise than from himself; and thinking from himself that God is in him is thinking"

From this it is clear that such are atheists, some avowedly, some clandestinely, and some ignorantly. And as they regard dominion as an end, and the holy things of heaven and the church as means, they counterfeit angels of light in face, gesture, and speech, and thus profane holy things. 1059. And yet is, signifies that it still is, because it is Divine, and has not been rejected except by profaners. This is evident from the signification of the “beast” of which this is said, as being the Word. That this still is, and that it is commonly acknowledged to be Divine, and its sanctity to be equal to that of the decrees and bulls of the pope is known; and that it is nevertheless rejected by those who deny Divine truths in heart, and thus profane the holy things of the church, has been shown above. The expression “and yet is” is a hidden saying, that has respect to those who acknowledge the Word to be Divine, of whom we shall speak in the explanation of the sixteenth and seventeenth verses of this chapter.

When such after death become spirits they appear encompassed with a cloud, in the midst of which is something black, like an Egyptian mummy.

He that hath intelligence let him count the number of the beast (Rev. 13:18). The angel did not explain the vision in the natural sense from the spiritual, because his explanation constitutes the Word in the letter; and the Word in the letter must be natural, in every particular of which the spiritual sense must be stored up; otherwise the Word would not serve the heavens as a basis; nor would it serve the church as the means for its conjunction with heaven. For the same reason when angels explain visions elsewhere in the Word, as in Daniel and the rest of the prophets, they explain them in a sense merely natural, and not at all in the natural sense from the spiritual. The natural sense from the spiritual is when the signification of “the seven mountains,” “the seven kings,” and the other things is explained, namely, that “mountains” signify the goods of the Word, and “seven mountains” these profaned; and that “kings” signify the truths of the Word, and “seven kings” these profaned.

When a man is in these evils, and has not been purified from them by turning away from them and hating them, and still worships God devoutly, as has been said above, then he profanes; for he mingles his internals which are impure with externals that are pious, and these he defiles. For there can be nothing external that does not proceed and exist from internals. The actions and speech of man are his externals, and thoughts and volitions are his internals. Man can speak only from thought, and can act only from volition. When the life of the thoughts and of the will is imbued with cunning, malice, and violence, it must needs be that these, as interior crimes of the life, will flow into the speech and actions pertaining to worship and piety, and defile them as filth defiles waters. [3] This worship is what is meant by “Gog and Magog” (Rev. 20:8), and is thus described in Isaiah: What is the multitude of sacrifices unto me, meal offerings, incense, sabbaths, new moons, appointed feasts, and prayers, when your hands are full of bloods? Wash you, make you clean, put away the wickednesses of your doings; cease to do evil (Isa. 1:11–19).

When such live according to the statutes of the pope, and acknowledge him to be the Lord’s vicar, and observe the holy things of worship as they have been instituted, they are not dissimilar to upright pagans, who know not otherwise than that they are truths, goods and holy things which their ministers and monks teach; and this the more because they do not read the Word, some because it has been taken away from them, and some because under persuasion they depend upon the mouth of their monks, and believe that these alone and no others understand the Word.

In regard to “the seven mountains” upon which the woman was seen to sit, it is believed that they are the seven mountains of Rome, where the Papal throne is. But admitting that Rome is meant, still “the seven mountains” signify the goods of the Word adulterated and profaned; for the Word is spiritual in every part, and this is the spiritual of it.

Of this kind there are some who still more fully profane; these are like those just described, but by reasonings and by the Word falsely interpreted they defend their vices, as adulteries and lusts that belong to their nature, and thus to their enjoyment.

For in the Word where good is treated of truth is also treated of, because of the heavenly marriage, which is the marriage of good and truth in all the particulars of it (see above, n. 238, 660, 775). [2] One who does not know that in the Word “kings” signify truths can by no means know what is meant by “kings” in many passages in the Word, as in Daniel where it is said: The heads and the horns of the beasts are kings or kingdoms (Dan. 7:17, 24; also in Rev. 16:12, 14; 18:3; 19:19; 21:24; and elsewhere). And in this chapter: The seven heads are seven kings; the five have fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet come. And the beast that was and is not is the eighth king, and is of the seven, and he goeth into perdition. And the ten horns are ten kings, who have not yet received a kingdom; and other things that follow (Rev. 17:10–12). For if kings were here meant by “kings” it could not possibly be divined by any conjecture what these expressions mean. But when it is known that “kings” signify the truths of the Word and thus the truths of the church, the meaning is plainly evident. Moreover, by the numbers so many truths are not to be understood, but such truths as are signified by the number in the spiritual sense. For if seven truths were signified by the “seven kings,” and five truths by “the five kings who have fallen,” and ten truths by the “ten kings” and as many “horns,” from all this no spiritual sense could in any way result; therefore it must be altogether known that all numbers signify in the Word the qualities of the things which are described."

That is said to be profane that is the opposite of what is holy, and that offers violence to what is holy and destroys it. From this it follows that those do not belong to this kind of profanation who do not read the Word and do not approach the Lord, as is the case with the Papists, still less those who know nothing about the Lord and the Word, like the Gentiles. Those who belong to this kind of profanation appear after death at first with a face of human color, around which float many wandering stars; and those of them that had been leaders sometimes appear shining about the mouth. But as they are brought into the light of heaven, the stars and the shining of the mouth vanish, and the color of the face is changed to black, and likewise their garments. But the blackness of these profaners draws something from blue, as the blackness of the other kind of profaners draws something from red, for the reason that the latter profane the goods of the Word and of the church, while the others profane the truths of the Word and of the church. For red derives from the sun its signification of good, while blue derives from the sky its signification of truth. 1064.

This is evident from the signification of “the five have fallen,” as being that of the rest nothing is here said.

(On the signification of this number see n. 584.) That “the five have fallen” signifies that nothing is said of the rest is evident also from what follows, “The one is, and the other is not yet come, and when he is come he must continue a little while,” which signifies that the two profaned truths that are the heads of the rest must here be spoken of; and of the other it is further said in"

Therefore the two profaned truths here treated of, that are the heads of the rest, are that they have transferred to themselves the Lord’s Divine authority, and that they have rejected the Word. The transferring of the Lord’s Divine authority to themselves is signified by the “one king who is,” and by “the other who is to come”; and their rejection of the Word by the “beast” that is the eighth king, and yet among the seven.

For those who make jokes from the Word do not regard it as holy, and those who joke about it hold it in no esteem. And yet the Word is the very Divine truth of the Lord with men, and the Lord is present in the Word, and heaven also; for every particular of the Word communicates with heaven, and through heaven with the Lord; therefore to jest from the Word and about the Word is to bespatter the holy things of heaven with the dust of the earth. 1065. And the one is, signifies the adulterated and profaned truth that the Lord’s authority over heaven and earth, thus over men to save them, is transferred to their head, and from him to the others who are under him. This is evident from the series of things regarded in the internal sense. For as the “seven kings” signify all the truths of the Word profaned, and “the five have fallen” signifies that nothing is here said about the rest of the truths, or that they are to be passed by, only the two that are heads of the rest, namely, that respecting the Lord’s authority over heaven and earth, and that"

[2] In respect to the matter itself, namely, that they have transferred the Lord’s authority over heaven and earth, thus over men to save them, to their head and from him to the others who are under him, this is well known; and it is evident from this that with all the heart and mind they aspire to be gods over the earth, consequently to be adored with Divine worship. That their head is adored as a god in place of the Lord is evident from their venerating him upon the knees, from the holy kissing of his shoes, also of his footsteps. This veneration or rather adoration follows from this, that he is able to open heaven by the keys of Peter, and thus to give heaven to whomsoever he pleases; also by the same means to close heaven, thus to cast into hell whomsoever he pleases. Nor is this enough; they aspire to dominion over the earth, and to this end under various pretenses of sanctity they scrape together and bring into their monasteries, which are so many treasuries, the wealth of the kingdoms of the world, thus subjecting to themselves both the souls of men and their resources; consequently not only the things of heaven but also those of the world with men. For they know that he who possesses the souls of men and also their wealth, possesses men as God does, and can transfer to himself a kind of Divine worship. From this it is clear that those who belong to the Babylon of the present day aspire with the whole heart and mind to be gods, and to be adored with Divine worship. But although they aspire to this they deny that they have transferred anything Divine to themselves, as will be shown in the following article."

It was said of old that the Word is from God, divinely inspired, and thus holy; and yet it has not been known heretofore where in the Word the Divine is. For the Word appears in the letter like a common writing in a strange style, not so sublime or so lucid as appears in the writings of the present age. For this reason a man who worships nature more than God, or in place of God, and thus thinks from himself and what is his own [proprium], and not from the Lord out of heaven, can easily fall into error respecting the Word, and into contempt for it, saying in his heart when he reads it, “What is this? What is that? Is this Divine? Can God who has infinite wisdom speak in this manner? Where is its holiness, and from what source, unless from the religious persuasion whose ministers it serves?” And other like things. But that they may know that the Word is Divine, not only in every sentence but also in every expression, its internal sense, which is spiritual, and which is in its external sense, which is natural, as a soul in its body, has now been revealed. This sense can bear witness to the Divinity and consequent holiness of the Word; and can convince even the natural man that the Word is Divine if he is willing to be convinced. 1066. The other is not yet come, and when he is come he must remain a short time, signifies the profaned truth that the Lord’s authority over heaven and earth, assumed by them, is said not to be Divine, and yet it is Divine. This is evident from the signification of “the other king” of the two that remained besides “the five” of the seven that “had fallen,” as being here the other truth profaned, which nevertheless is one with the former, with the difference that the Lord’s authority over heaven and earth, which they have transferred to themselves, is said not to be Divine, and yet it is Divine. And because it is Divine, although this is denied, it is said that “this king,” that is, this profaned truth, “is not yet come”; and that “when he is come he must remain a short time,” which signifies that that authority is Divine, although it is said that it is not Divine.

That he acts as one with the former with this difference is evident from the following verse, in which the beast is said to be “the eighth king, and yet of the seven”; therefore as the beast is said to be one king of the seven, it follows that these two that remain after five of the seven had fallen, and that are called “the one” and “the other,” have respect to one matter, that is, to one profaned truth; and that the other profaned truth is what is signified by the beast, so far as that is said to be “one king of the seven.” [2] In respect to the thing itself it is well known that they claim that the authority over heaven, and over the souls of men to save them, is not Divine, since it was the authority of the Lord’s human transferred to him from God the Father, and from the Lord to Peter. But this is said from a fear that the common people may withdraw from them. Nevertheless, that authority is Divine as is clearly evident from this, that after God had created the universe, the chief object of the Divine power is to deliver men from hell and to save them. For man is not saved in a single moment, since he is reformed and regenerated by the Lord by successive steps from infancy even to the end of his life in the world, and afterwards to eternity; and to this no human power can contribute in the least. That man is thus reformed and regenerated by the Lord they do not know, because they do not wish to know it; consequently they persuade themselves that salvation is instantaneous, and is simply an admission into heaven, which is a huge falsity. But on this more will be said elsewhere. (Continuation respecting the Word) [3] In a summary: The Word is Divine truth itself, which gives wisdom to angels and enlightens men. As Divine truth proceeds from the Lord, and as what proceeds is himself out of himself, the same as light and heat proceed from the sun and are the sun, that is, are of the sun out of it, and as the Word is the Divine truth, it is also the Lord, as it is called in John (1:1–3, 14).

This is why there are in the Word four senses, one outside of the other from the highest heaven down to the world, or one within the other from the world up to the highest heaven. These four senses are called the celestial, the spiritual, the natural from the celestial and the spiritual, and the merely natural. This last is for the world, the next for the lowest heaven, the spiritual for the second heaven, and the celestial for the third. These four senses differ so greatly from one another that when one is exhibited beside the other no connection can be recognized; and yet they make one when one follows the other; for one follows from the other as an effect from a cause, or as what is posterior from what is prior; consequently as an effect represents its cause and corresponds to its cause, so the posterior sense corresponds to the prior; and thus it is that all four senses make one through correspondences. [4] From all this these truths follow. The ultimate sense of the Word, which is the sense of its letter, and the fourth in order, contains in itself the three interior senses, which are for the three heavens when a man on the earth is reverently reading the Word. Therefore the sense of the letter of the Word is that from which and through which there is communication with the heavens, also from which and through which man has conjunction with the heavens. The sense of the letter of the Word is the basis of Divine truth in the heavens, and without such a basis the Divine truth would be like a house without a foundation; and without such a basis the wisdom of the angels would be like a house in the air. It is the sense of the letter of the Word in which the power of Divine truth consists. It is the sense of the letter of the Word through which man is enlightened by the Lord and through which he receives answers when he wishes to be enlightened. It is the sense of the letter of the Word by which everything of doctrine on the earth must be confirmed. In the sense of the letter of the Word is the Divine truth in its fullness.

And the beast which was and is not is himself the eighth, and is of the seven, and he goeth into perdition, signifies that the truth that the Word is Divine has also been profaned; and yet it has been rejected. This is evident from the signification of “the beast,” as being the Word (see above, n. 1038); also from the signification of “which was and is not,” as being that the Word in the beginning was received and read, but afterwards was taken away, and not read (see above, n. 1054); also from the signification of “is himself the eighth, and is of the seven,” as being that the good and truth that the Word to them is Divine has been profaned (of which presently); also from the signification of “going into perdition,” as being that this is acknowledged for the sake of form, and still has been rejected (see above, n. 1055). From all this it can be seen that these words signify this profaned truth of good that the Word is Divine, and still it has been rejected. It has been received and acknowledged as Divine chiefly because their religion is founded on the keys given to Peter, as described in the Word. Nevertheless, that it has been rejected is well known, for it is taken away from the common people, it is not read in the temples, and the same holiness and inspiration are attributed to the decrees of the pope as to the Word; but as these are not in harmony with the Word, the Word in general is invalidated, and even blasphemed, by the claim that it is allowable to change it according to the state of the church. From this it is clear that the truth that the Word is Divine has been profaned by them. [2] That this is the signification of these words can be seen from this, that “the beast” treated of in this chapter signifies the Word, and is called the “eighth king,” and yet is “of the seven.” It is called “the eighth king” because a “king” signifies truth, and the number “eight” signifies good, and “seven” the truth of good profaned. For the Word is truth conjoined to good; therefore in every particular of it there is the marriage of good and truth. When this is seen to be the signification of these words their meaning is clearly evident; but otherwise no one could perceive nor indeed surmise what is meant by “the beast is the eighth king and yet of the seven, and he goeth into perdition,” for to be the eighth and yet to be of the seven would be a contradiction.

(Continuation respecting the Word) [3] That the Word is the Divine truth itself, which gives wisdom to angels and enlightens men, can be apperceived or seen only by a man enlightened. For to a worldly man, whose mind has not been raised above the sensual sphere, the Word in the sense of the letter appears so simple that scarcely anything could be more simple; and yet the Divine truth, such as it is in the heavens, and from which angels have their wisdom, lies concealed in it as in its sanctuary. For the Word in the letter is like the adytum in the midst of a temple covered with a veil, within which lie deposited arcana of heavenly wisdom such as no ear hath heard. For in the Word and in every particular of it there is a spiritual sense, and in that a Divine celestial sense, which regarded in itself is the Divine truth itself, which is in the heavens and which gives wisdom to angels and enlightens men. The Divine truth in the heavens is light proceeding from the Lord as a sun, which is the Divine love. And as the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord is the light of heaven, so it is the Divine wisdom. This illuminates both the minds and the eyes of angels, and also enlightens the minds of men, but not their eyes, and enables them to understand truth and also to perceive good when man reads the Word from the Lord and not from self; for he is then in consort with angels, and interiorly has a perception like the spiritual perception of angels; and that spiritual perception which the man-angel has flows into his natural perception, which is his own while in the world, and enlightens it. Consequently the man who reads the Word from the affection of truth has enlightenment through heaven from the Lord."

For the Lord reforms man, and the Word teaches how man must live that he may be reformed by the Lord; therefore if these two truths are not acknowledged and received the church itself perishes, for upon these two truths the church is founded. It was for this reason that it came to pass through the Divine providence of the Lord that certain churches separated themselves from the Babylonish, and these acknowledge the Lord’s Divine power over heaven and earth to be equal to the power of God the Father, and also attribute Divine holiness to the Word alone. This was provided by the Lord in order that the Christian church in the European world might not be utterly overthrown. That this is the signification of “the ten horns which are ten kings” will appear from what follows. (Continuation respecting the Word) [2] Since the Word is the Divine truth, and this proceeds from the Lord’s Divine being [esse] as light proceeds from the sun, it follows as a consequence that the Lord is the Word because he is the Divine truth. The Lord is the Word because he is the Divine truth, and this proceeds from his Divine being, which is the Divine love, because the Divine love was in him when he was in the world as the soul is in its body; and as the Divine truth proceeds from the Divine love as light proceeds from the sun, as has been said, therefore the Lord’s human in the world was the Divine truth proceeding from the Divine love that was in him. That the Divine itself, which is called “Jehovah” and the “Father,” and which is the Divine love, was in the Lord from conception, is evident in the gospels of Matthew and Luke. In Matthew from these words: When Mary the mother of Jesus had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found with child of the Holy Spirit."

And Joseph knew her not until she had brought forth her firstborn son; and he called his name Jesus (Matt. 1:18–25). And in Luke from these words: The angel said to Mary, Behold thou shalt conceive in the womb, and bring forth a son, and shall call his name Jesus; he shall be great, and shall be called the son of the most high. But Mary said unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man? The angel answered her, The Holy Spirit shall come upon thee, and the power of the most high shall overshadow thee; wherefore also the holy one that shall be born of thee shall be called the son of God (Luke 1:30–35). It was because he was conceived of Jehovah that he is so frequently called in the Word “the son of God,” and Jehovah is called his “Father.” Jehovah as to his being [esse] is the Divine love, and as to his existing [existere] he is the Divine good united to the Divine truth. [3] From this it can be seen what is meant by: The Word that was with God and that was God, and also was the light that enlighteneth every man (John 1:1–10), namely, that it was the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord, thus the Lord as to his existing. That the Lord as to his existing was Divine truth, and that this was his Divine human, because this existed from his Divine being as the body from its soul, these words in John clearly certify: The Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only-begotten of the Father (John 1:14). “The Word” is the Divine truth, which also is “glory”; “flesh” means the Divine human, “the only-begotten of the Father” means that which exists or proceeds from the Divine being in him."

Within Babylon there are those in the kingdom of France, and many in Holland, England, Scotland, and Ireland, who have not taken away from the Lord the power to save men, nor from the Word Divine holiness, and ascribed these to some vicar; as may appear from the contest between the Gallican church and the Roman, which has so long continued and still continues. These are the things especially treated of in verses 12–14 of this chapter. Since outside of the kingdoms of Babylon there are churches that ascribe all power to save to the Lord, and none to the pope, and acknowledge the Word alone to be Divine, and have wholly withdrawn from the papal dominion, and are consequently called Protestants and Reformed, so these also are treated of in this chapter.

That when the Lord was in the world he was the Divine truth, which is the Word, he himself teaches in many passages where he calls himself “the Light,” also where he calls himself “the way, the truth, and the life”; and where he says that “the spirit of truth” proceeds from"

Moreover, all things of the Lord’s passion represented the kind of violence that the Jewish nation offered to the Word.

It can be said of every regenerate man that he is his own truth and his own good, since the thought which belongs to his understanding is from truths, and the affection which belongs to his will is from goods. Whether you say, therefore, that a man is his own understanding and his own will, or that a man is his own truth and his own good, it amounts to the same thing. The body is mere obedience; for it speaks that which man thinks from the understanding, and does that which he wills from affection. Thus these things and the body mutually correspond and make one, like an effect and its effecting cause; and these taken together constitute the human. [3] As it can be said of the regenerate man that he is his own truth and his own good, so it can be said of the Lord as man, that he is the truth itself or the Divine truth, and good itself or the Divine good. All this makes evident the truth that the Lord as to his human in the world was the Divine truth, that is, the Word; and that everything that he then spoke was the Divine truth, which is the Word; and that afterwards when he went to the Father, that is, became one with the Father, the Divine truth proceeding from him is the spirit of truth, which goes forth and proceeds from him, and at the same time from the Father in him."

These are the ones here meant. (Continuation respecting the Word) [2] That the Word is holy and Divine from inmosts to outermosts is not evident to the man who leads himself, but is evident to the man whom the Lord leads. For the man who leads himself sees only the external of the Word, and judges from its style; but the man whom the Lord leads judges of the external of the Word from the holiness that is in it. The Word is like a garden, that may be called a heavenly paradise, in which are dainties and delightful things of every kind, dainties from the fruits, and delightful things from the flowers; and in the middle of it trees of life, and near them fountains of living water, and round about trees of the forest, and near them rivers.

The man whom the Lord leads is actually in the middle of it, and looks to the Lord; but the man who leads himself actually sits down at the circumference, and looks away from it to the world. [3] Again, the Word is like fruit within which there is a nutritious pulp, and in the middle of it seed vessels, in which inmostly is a living germ that germinates in good soil. Again, the Word is also like a most beautiful infant, which, except the face, is enveloped in wrappings upon wrappings; the infant itself is in the inmost heaven, the wrappings are in the lower heavens, and the general covering of the wrappings is on the earth. As the Word is such it is holy and Divine from inmosts to the externals. 1073. For he is Lord of lords, and king of kings, signifies because the Lord is good itself and truth itself, and thus omnipotent, as is evident from the fact that the Lord is called “Lord” from the Divine good, and “king” from the Divine truth. There are two things that proceed from the Lord, namely, the Divine good and the Divine truth. These two proceed from the Lord united, but in heaven they are received by the angels not so united. In the highest or third heaven more Divine good than Divine truth is received; in the middle or second heaven more Divine truth than Divine good is received. Therefore the third heaven is called the Lord’s dominion, and the second heaven is called the Lord’s kingdom; and thence also the angels who are in the third heaven are called sons of the Lord, and also lords, and the angels in the second heaven are called sons of the kingdom and sons of the king, and also kings. These two classes of angels are meant by “lords” and by “kings,” when the Lord is called “Lord of lords and king of kings.” So, too, when he is called “God of gods,” the Lord is meant by “God,” and the angels by “gods.” But in general “lords” in the spiritual sense mean all who are in the good of love to the Lord from the Lord, and “kings” those who are in the doctrine of truth from that love, whether in the heavens or on the earth.

Because all things are done by the Lord from the Divine good by means of the Divine truth, “Lord of lords and king of kings” means also the Lord as omnipotent. (Continuation respecting the Word) [2] The Word is such because in its origin it is the Divine itself that proceeds from the Lord, and is called the Divine truth; and when this descended to men in the world it passed through the heavens in their order according to their degrees, which are three; and in each heaven it was written there in accommodation to the wisdom and intelligence of the angels. Finally it was brought down from the Lord through the heavens to men, and there it was written and promulgated in adaptation to man’s understanding and apprehension. This, therefore, is the sense of its letter, and in this the Divine truth such as it is in the three heavens, lies stored up in distinct order. From this it is clear that all the wisdom of the angels in the three heavens has been imparted by the Lord to our Word, and in its inmost there is the wisdom of the angels of the third heaven, which is incomprehensible and ineffable to man, because full of arcana and treasures of Divine verities. These lie stored up in each particular and in all the particulars of our Word. And as the Divine truth is the Lord in the heavens, so the Lord himself is present, and may be said to dwell in all the particulars and each particular of his Word, as he does in his heavens; and in the same way as he has said of the ark of the Covenant, in which were deposited only the Ten Commandments written on the two tables, the first fruits of the Word, for he said that he would speak there with Moses and Aaron, that he would be present there, that he would dwell there, and that it was his holy of holies, and his dwelling place as in heaven."

Verse 15 treats of profaned goods and truths in general, thus of all other truths.

This is the series of things in the internal sense from verses 12 to 17. (Continuation respecting the Word) [2] It has been said that the Divine truth proceeds from the Lord, and that the Word is from that, and that through the Word angels and men have wisdom. But so long as it is unknown how the Divine truth proceeds from the Lord, this may be said but it cannot be understood. The Divine truth, which is the same as the Divine wisdom, proceeds from the Lord as light and heat do from the sun. The Lord is the Divine love itself, and love appears in the heavens from correspondence as fire, and the Lord’s Divine love as a sun, glowing and resplendent like the sun of the world. From that sun, which is high above the heavens where the angels are, and which is the Divine love, heat and light proceed; the heat therefrom is the Divine good, and the light therefrom is the Divine truth. The heat is the Divine good, because all the heat of life proceeding from love is felt as good, for it is spiritual heat; and the light is the Divine truth, because all the light proceeding from love is felt as truth, for it is spiritual light; consequently it is from that light that the understanding sees truths, and it is from that heat that the will is sensible of goods; and this is why in the Word love is meant by heavenly fire and wisdom by heavenly light.

That sphere consists of the good of his love and of the truth of his love, for love produces both, as fire produces both heat and light; from the will of a man or angel it produces good, and from his understanding it produces truth. This sphere, when the man or angel is good, has an extension into the heavens in every direction according to the quality and the amount of the love, and into the hells in every direction when the man or angel is evil. But the sphere of the love of a man or an angel has a finite extension into a few societies only of heaven or hell, while the sphere of the Lord’s love, because it is Divine, has an infinite extension, and creates the heavens themselves. 1077.

This is evident from the signification of “peoples,” as being those who are in truths, and in the contrary sense those who are in falsities (see n. 175b, 331, 625); also from the signification of “multitudes,” as being also those who are in truths or in falsities, for “multitudes” mean people of a lower kind; also from the signification of “nations,” as being those who are in goods, and in the contrary sense those who are in evils (see n. 175, 331a, b; 452; 455a, b; 625); also from the signification of “tongues,” as being those who are in various confessions and perceptions of good (see n. 455, 625, 657, 990). “Peoples, multitudes, nations, and tongues” signify falsities and evils interior and exterior, because the truly spiritual sense comprehends things abstracted from persons; and thus when you take away from “peoples,” who are those who are in truths or falsities, all idea of person, truths or falsities are signified instead. The same is true of “multitudes, nations, and tongues.” Falsities and evils are signified, because the “earth” signifies the church, and therefore “peoples, multitudes, nations, and tongues” signify the things of which the church consists, which are either truths and goods or falsities and evils; and as every church is internal and external, because its truths and goods or falsities and evils are interior and exterior, therefore these are the things that are signified"

(Continuation respecting the Word) [2] The Word of the Lord is wonderful in this, that in every particular of it there is a reciprocal union of good and truth, which testifies that the Word is the Divine proceeding from the Lord, which is the Divine good and the Divine truth reciprocally united; and also testifies that in the Word there is a marriage of the Lord with heaven and the church, which also is reciprocal. There is a marriage of good and truth, also of truth and good, in every particular of the Word, in order that it may be a source of wisdom to angels and of intelligence to men, for from good alone no wisdom or intelligence is born, neither from truth alone, but from their marriage when the love is reciprocal. This reciprocal love the Lord teaches in John: He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood abideth in me and I in him (John 6:56). In that day ye shall know, that ye are in me and I in you. He that hath my commandments and doeth them, he it is that loveth me; and I will love him (John 14:20–21).

Again, as good is of the will and truth is of the understanding, and as the will and understanding make man, it follows that man is man according to the union of the will and all things belonging to it with the understanding and all things belonging to it, and this reciprocally.

These senses are in the sense of the letter, one within the other, and are evolved therefrom one after the other, each from its own heaven, when a man who is led by the Lord reads the Word.

These changes in the face are correspondences, as consequently the face itself is; and the action of the mind into it, that the correspondences may be exhibited, is called influx. The sight of man’s thought, which is called the understanding, corresponds to the sight of his eyes; and consequently the quality of the thought from the understanding is made evident from the light and flame of the eyes. The sight of the eye is a correspondence, as consequently the eye itself is; the action of the understanding into the eye, by which the correspondence is exhibited, is influx. The active thought, which belongs to the understanding, corresponds to speech, which belongs to the mouth. The speech is a correspondence, likewise the mouth and everything belonging to it, and the action of thought into speech and into the organs of speech is influx. The perception of the mind corresponds to the smell of the nostrils. The smell and the nostrils are correspondences, and the action is influx.

From these few examples it can be seen what correspondence is and what influx is; and that when the spiritual, which belongs to the life of man’s understanding and will, flows into the acts which belong to his body, it exhibits itself in a natural effigy, and there is correspondence; also that thus the spiritual and the natural act as one by correspondences, like interior and exterior, or like prior and posterior, or like the effecting cause and the effect, or like the principal cause which belongs to man’s thought and will, and the instrumental cause which belongs to his speech and action.

And because a man becomes wise from understanding and believing in truth, it is said “if the eye be sound the whole body is lucid.” The “body” means the man, and “to be lucid” means to be wise. But it is the reverse with the “evil eye,” that is, understanding and believing in falsity. “Darkness” means falsities, “if the light [lumen] be darkness” signifies if the truth be false or falsified, and because truth falsified is worse than any other falsity, it is said, “If the light be darkness, how great is the darkness.” [5] These few examples make clear what correspondence is and what influx is, namely, that the eye is a correspondence of the understanding and faith, the heart a correspondence of the will and love, the ears a correspondence of obedience, the lamp and light correspondences of truth, and darkness a correspondence of falsity, and so on; and as the one is spiritual and the other natural, and the spiritual acts into the natural and forms it to an image of itself that it may appear before the eyes or before the world, therefore that action is influx. Such is the Word in each and every particular. 1082. And shall eat her flesh, signifies rejection of its evils, which are adulterated goods, and then the manifestation that they were without any good. This is evident from the signification of “flesh,” as being the good of the Word and of the church, and in the contrary sense the evil thereof. Here “flesh” means evils, which are adulterated goods. Also from the signification of “to eat,” as being to consume, but here to reject wholly, because this is said of the Reformed, who have rejected the works or goods of Babylon, which consist especially in gifts to the idols of their saints, to their sepulchers, also to monasteries, and to the monks themselves, given as offerings for various expiations. It follows that the same words mean also the manifestation that they were without any good, for when spurious and meritorious goods are rejected, which are"

It signifies what is man’s own [proprium], thus either his good or evil, and from this it signifies the whole man. But in the highest sense it signifies the Lord’s Divine human, and particularly the Divine good of the Divine love that proceeds from him. That “flesh” signifies the Divine human as to the good of love is evident in John: Jesus said, I am the living bread, which cometh down out of heaven; if anyone eat of this bread he shall live forever; and the bread which I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world. The Jews, therefore, strove one with another, saying, How can this one give his flesh to eat? Jesus therefore said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, except ye eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood ye shall not have life in yourselves. He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day; for my flesh is truly food, and my blood is truly drink. He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood abideth in me and I in him. This is the bread which cometh down out of heaven (John 6:51–58). It is clearly evident that “flesh” here means the own of the Lord’s Divine human, which is the Divine good of the Divine love, and is that which is called in the holy supper the body. (That the “body” there, that is, the “flesh,” is the Divine good, and the “blood” is the Divine truth, may be seen above, n. 329b.) And as “bread and wine” have the same signification as “flesh and blood,” “bread” meaning the Divine good, and “wine” the Divine truth, therefore these were commanded in place of flesh and blood. [3] Divine good from the Lord was signified also by the flesh of the sacrifices that Aaron, his sons, and those who sacrificed, and others who were clean, might eat: And that this was holy (may be seen in Exod. 12:7–9; 29:31–34; Lev. 7:15–21; 8:31; Deut. 12:27; 16:4);"

The Lord’s Divine human is also called “flesh” in John: The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us; and we saw his glory, the glory as of the only-begotten of the Father (John 1:14). [4] That “flesh” signified also the good with man can be seen from the following passages. In Ezekiel: I will give them one heart, and I will give a new spirit in the midst of you, and I will take away the heart of stone out of their flesh, and I will give them a heart of flesh (Ezek. 11:19; 36:26). “Heart of flesh” means the will and love of good. In David: O God, thou art my God, in the morning I seek thee; my soul thirsteth for thee; my flesh longeth for thee in a land of drought and weariness without waters (Ps. 63:1). My soul longeth for the courts of Jehovah; my heart and my flesh cry out unto the living God (Ps. 84:2). The “flesh” that longeth for Jehovah, and that crieth out unto the living God, signifies man as to good of the will, for the “flesh” of man corresponds to the good or evil of his will, and the “blood” to the truth or falsity of his understanding; here “flesh” means the good of the will, because it longeth for Jehovah and crieth out unto God.

To see God from one’s flesh signifies from one’s own voluntary made new by the Lord, and thus good. In Ezekiel: Upon the bones seen in the midst of the valley, I will put sinews, and I will cause flesh to come up upon them, and I will cover them with skin, and I will give spirit unto them that they may live (Ezek. 37:6, 8). Here, too, “flesh” signifies what is one’s own [proprium] of the will made new by the Lord, and thus good. What “bones” and the rest signify here may be seen above (n. 418b, 419, 665). In Revelation: Come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great God, that ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of commanders of thousands, and the flesh of the mighty, and the flesh of horses and of them that sit on them, and the flesh of all, free and bond, small and great (Rev. 19:17–18; Ezek. 39:17–19). That “flesh” here does not mean flesh but goods of every kind, is clearly evident. [6] But on the other hand, that “flesh” signifies man’s own voluntary, which regarded in itself is evil, is evident from the following passages. In Isaiah: They shall eat every man the flesh of his own arm (Isa. 9:20). I will feed thine oppressors with their own flesh (Isa. 49:26).

The evil of man’s will, which is what is his own from birth, is what is signified in these passages by “flesh”; also by: The flesh that the sons of Israel lusted after in the desert, and on account of which they were smitten with a great plague, and from which the place was called graves of lust (Num. 11:4–34). Moreover, in the Word the expression “all flesh” is frequently used as meaning every man (as in Gen. 6:12, 13, 17, 19; Isa. 40:5, 6; 49:26; 66:16, 23, 24; Jer. 25:31; 32:27; 45:5; Ezek. 20:48; 21:4, 5; and elsewhere).

This is evident from the signification of “burning with fire,” as being to destroy the things of the church that have been profaned by the love of having dominion. The punishment for profaning the holy things of the church was burning with fire, for the reason that that “fire” represented the fire of hell, and “to be burned” signified to perish thereby, and the fire of hell is the love of having dominion. “To be burned up with fire” is here the punishment for profaning the holy things of the church, since the harlot is here referred to, and “Babylon” as a “harlot” signifies profanation of the holy things of the church by the diabolical love of having dominion over them. “To be burned up with fire” has a like signification as “Tophet” in the valley of Hinnom, where they burned sons and daughters, and which signified in the spiritual sense the profanation of the truths and goods of the church, “sons” its truths, and “daughters” its goods. The valley of Achor, where Achan, who took of the devoted thing, was burned with fire after he had been stoned, has nearly the same signification. From all this it can be seen that “burning the harlot with fire” signifies the rejection of the whole religious persuasion that has profaned the holy things of the church by the love of having dominion over them and over heaven. This means rejection by the Reformed, as above."

(That all the heavens are divided into two kingdoms, the spiritual and the celestial, may be seen in Heaven and Hell n. 20–28.) Now as there is one sense within another, the first which is the sense of the letter for the natural world, the second which is the internal sense for the spiritual kingdom, and the third which is the inmost for the celestial kingdom, it follows that the natural man draws from it his sense, the spiritual angel his sense, and the celestial angel his sense, thus everyone what is analogous to and in agreement with his own essence and nature. This takes place whenever a man who is led by the Lord is reading the Word. [3] But let this be illustrated by examples. When this commandment of the Decalogue is read: “Thou shalt honor thy father and thy mother,” a man in the world understands by “father and mother” a father and mother on the earth, and also all who are or may be in the place of father or mother; and by “honoring” he understands to hold such in honor. But an angel of the spiritual kingdom understands by “father” the Divine good, and by “mother” the Divine truth, and by “honoring” loving; while an angel of the celestial kingdom understands by “father” the Lord, and by “mother” heaven and the church, and by “honoring” doing. [4] When the fifth commandment of the Decalogue, “Thou shalt not steal,” is read, by “stealing” a man understands stealing, defrauding, and taking away under any pretense his neighbor’s goods.

But an angel of the spiritual kingdom by “committing adultery” understands falsifying the truths of the Word and adulterating its goods, while an angel of the celestial kingdom by “committing adultery” understands blaspheming against the Lord, heaven, and the church.

For the heavens rest upon the human race as a house rests upon its foundation; so the wisdom of the angels of heaven rests in like manner upon the knowledge, intelligence, and wisdom of men from the sense of the letter of the Word; for as has been said above, communication and conjunction with the heavens are effected through the sense of the letter of the Word. Thence it is, that of the Lord’s Divine providence it has come to pass, that the Word as to the sense of the letter from its first revelation has not been mutilated,5 not even as to an expression and letter in the original text, for every expression is a support, and in some measure the letters. From all this it is clear what a profanation it is to falsify the truths and adulterate the goods of the Word, and how infernal it is to deny or to weaken its holiness. As soon as that is done, for that man of the church heaven is closed. The blasphemy against the Holy Spirit, which cannot be forgiven, is the blasphemy of the Word by those who deny its holiness. Since the Word is the basis of the heavens, and since the Word has been wholly falsified and adulterated by the Jewish nation by traditions and by applications of the sense of the letter to favor their evil loves, lest the heavens should be endangered and the wisdom of the angels there should become foolishness, it has pleased the Lord to come down from heaven and to put on the human and to become the Word (as is evident from John 1:14), and thus to restore the state of heaven. 1086.

From what is related in this verse, also in verses 11, 12, 13, 16 above respecting the beast, and which is there explained, it is clearly evident that “the beast” signifies the Word received by those who are meant by “the harlot,” and yet rejected, and nevertheless defended by others both within Babylon and without it. [2] The Word can be meant by a “beast,” for a lion and a lamb are beasts, and yet by them the Lord is meant throughout the Word; also sheep, kids, rams, goats, and heifers are beasts, and yet by them the holy things of heaven and the church are signified throughout the Word; and again, “the beast out of the earth,” mentioned above, signified confirmations from the Word in favor of faith separated (see n. 815). That nothing else can be signified by this beast is clearly evident from what is said about it (verse 13), that “the ten kings would give their power and authority unto the beast”; also in verses 16 and 17, that “they would give their kingdom to the beast”; although they were those who “made the harlot desolate, ate her flesh, and burnt her up with fire.” [3] The harlot was seen sitting upon the beast because Babylon has founded her dominion upon certain passages in the Word; as upon those things which were said by the Lord to Peter. That the harlot would sit “upon many waters,” and elsewhere “upon treasures,” also that she was seen “arrayed in purple and scarlet, and inwrought with gold and precious stone and pearls, having in her hand a golden cup” (verses 1–4 of this chapter, and Jer. 51:13), has a like signification.

[5] And as all higher things place themselves in what is lowest in simultaneous order, it follows that in the ultimates of the Word, which constitute the sense of its letter, are all things of the Divine truth and of the Divine good, even from their firsts. And as all things of the Divine truth and the Divine good are together in their ultimate, which is the sense of the letter of the Word, there evidently is the power of Divine truth, yea, the omnipotence of the Lord in saving man. For when the Lord operates he operates not from first things through mediates into ultimates, but from first things through ultimates and thus into mediates. This is why the Lord is called in the Word the first and the last; and this is why the Lord assumed the human, which in the world was the Divine truth or the Word, and glorified it even to the ultimates, which are the bones and the flesh, in order that he might operate from first things through ultimates, and not as before from man, but from himself. This power in ultimates was represented by the hair with the Nazirites, as with Samson, for the hair corresponds to the ultimates of the Divine truth.

Until the words of God shall be consummated, signifies even to the last state of the church, when there is a judgment, and after that what is new. This is evident from the signification of “to be consummated,” as being to have an end; or specifically, when there is no longer any good and truth of doctrine and of life remaining, that is, when the last state of the church has come. (That consummation signifies the last state of the church can be seen n. 624b, 911.) And as the last judgment comes in the last state of the church, and after that the new church is established by the Lord, so “to be consummated” signifies the last state of the church when judgment takes place, and afterwards that which is new. Also from the signification of “the words of God,” as being predictions in the Word; therefore “the words of God shall be consummated” signifies when the predictions are fulfilled. It is said that those signified by “the ten horns of the beast” will “make the harlot desolate, eat her flesh, and burn her up with fire,” and “will give the kingdom to the beast, until the words of God shall be consummated,” because those also who have wholly withdrawn from Babylon and have rejected her profane things are then devastated as to all the goods and truths of heaven, that is, they have equally falsified the Word, not from the principle of having dominion over the holy things of the church and over heaven, but from the principle of separating works from faith, and when these have been separated there is no longer any living from the Lord, but only a living from self and the world, and that life is a life of evil from falsity, therefore “the words of God shall be consummated” also means when these, too, have been devastated. (Continuation respecting the Word) [2] Now since all interior things, that is, the spiritual and celestial things that are in the Words of the three heavens, are together in the ultimate sense of the Word, which is called the sense of the letter (for in its inmosts there are the things that are in the Word with the angels of the third heaven, and in its middle parts the"

From this it can be seen that the Divine truth is in its fullness in the sense of the letter of our Word. That is said to be full which contains in itself all things prior, even from the first, or all things higher even from the highest; the ultimate is what includes these. The fullness of the Word is like a general vessel of marble, in which are countless lesser vessels of crystal, and in these still more numerous vessels of precious stones, in and about which are the most delightful things of heaven which are for those who perform noble uses from the Word. That the Word is such is not evident to man while he is in the world; but it is evident to him when he becomes an angel. Because the Word is such in ultimates it follows that it is not the Word until it is in that ultimate, that is, until it is in the sense of the letter. The Word not in that ultimate would be like a temple in the air and not on the earth, or like a man having flesh but without bones. [3] As the Divine truth is in its fullness and also in its power in its ultimate, for when it is in that it is in all things at once, therefore the Lord never works except from first things through ultimates, and thus in fullness. For he reforms and regenerates man only through truths in ultimates, which are natural. And this is why a man after his departure out of the world remains to eternity such as he has been in the world. For the same reason heaven and hell are from the human race, and angels are not created immediately; for in the world a man is in his fullness, consequently he can there be conceived and born, and afterwards be imbued with knowledge, intelligence, and wisdom, and become an angel. To create angels in any other way is not given. [4] Because the Lord works all things from things first through ultimates, and is in his power and in his fullness in ultimates, therefore it pleased the Lord to take upon him the human and to become the Divine truth, that is, the Word, and thus from himself to reduce to order all things of heaven and all things of hell, that is, to execute a last judgment.

This was the chief reason for the Lord’s coming into the world, also for making his human Divine; for by this he put himself into the power of holding all things of heaven and all things of hell in order to eternity. This is meant by: Sitting at the right hand of God (Mark 16:19). “The right hand of God” means the Divine omnipotence, and “to sit at the right hand of God” means to be in that omnipotence through the human. That the Lord ascended into heaven with his human glorified even to the ultimates he testifies in Luke: Jesus said to the disciples, See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself, handle me and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones as ye behold me have (Luke 24:39). This the Lord said just before6 his resurrection. “Flesh and bones” are the ultimates of the human body, on which its strength depends. 1088. Verse 18.

(Continuation respecting the Word) [2] The Divine truth is what is called holy, but only when it is in its ultimate, and its ultimate is the Word in the sense of the letter; therefore the Divine truth there is holy, and may be called a sanctuary, and for the reason that that sense contains and encloses all the holy things of heaven and the church. The appearance is that the Divine truths in the heavens, which are called spiritual and celestial, are more holy than the Divine truths in the sense of the letter of the Word, which are natural; but the Divine truths in the heavens, which are called spiritual and celestial, are comparatively like the lungs and heart in man, which form the chest only when they are encompassed by ribs, and enclosed in the pleura and diaphragm; for without these integuments they could not perform their vital functions, and even unless connected with them by bonds. The spiritual things of the Word are like the breathing of the lungs, its celestial things are like the systole and diastole of the heart, and its natural things are like the pleura, the diaphragm, and the ribs, with the moving fibers attached, by which the motions are made reciprocal. [3] Again, the spiritual and celestial things of the Word are comparatively like the holy things of the tabernacle, which were the table upon which was the show bread, the golden altar upon which was the incense, the perfumes and the censer, also the lampstand with the lamps, and still further within the cherubim, the mercy seat and the ark. All these were the holy things of the Jewish and Israelitish church; nevertheless they could not be called holy and the sanctuary until they had been covered by curtains and veils, for without those coverings they would have stood under the naked sky, exposed to showers and storms, to the birds of heaven and the"

So would it be with the Divine truths in the heavens, which are called spiritual and celestial, unless they were enclosed in natural truths, like the truths of the sense of the letter of the Word. [4] Natural truths, which are the truths of the sense of the letter of the Word, are not the very truths of heaven, but are appearances of them; and appearances of truth encompass, enclose, and contain the truths of heaven, which are genuine truths, and cause them to be in connection and order and to act together, like the cardiac and pulmonary organs with their coverings and ribs, as has been said above; and when these truths are held in connection and in order they are holy, and not till then. This the sense of the letter of our Word does by means of the appearances of truth of which its ultimate consists; and this is why that sense is the holy Divine itself and the sanctuary. [5] But he is greatly mistaken who separates appearances of truth from genuine truths and calls these appearances holy by themselves and from themselves, and not the sense of the letter holy by genuine truths and from them and together with them. He separates these who sees only the sense of the letter and does not explore its meaning, as those do who do not read the Word from doctrine. The “cherubim” mean in the Word a guard and protection that the holy things of heaven be not violated, and that the Lord be approached only through love; consequently these signify the sense of the letter of the Word, because that is what guards and protects. It guards and protects in this manner that man can think and speak according to the appearances of truth so long as he is well-disposed, simple, and as it were an infant; but he must take heed not to so confirm appearances as to destroy the genuine truths in the heavens. 1089.

This makes clear that “having a kingdom over the kings of the earth” signifies domination over the truths of the church. There is domination over the truths of the church because their chief, who is called pope and pontiff, ascribes to his own decrees an equal holiness and a like inspiration with the truths of the Word. It is also a part of this doctrine that it is lawful for him to change the truths of the Word according to the changes of the state of the church, and thus to turn them into such things as may be means of domination, and these are falsities; for all things that have regard to domination are falsities, or truths falsified, since the end chooses the means and applies them to itself; and means that are applied to an end which is domination over the souls of men, over all things of the church and over heaven, cannot be truths, and if they are truths the end falsifies them, but with those only who are in dominion. (Continuation respecting the Word) [2] It is an invariable truth that no one can understand the Word without doctrine; for he may be led away into any errors to which he may be inclined from some love, or to which he may be drawn from some principle, whereby his mind becomes unsettled and uncertain, and at length as it were destitute of truth. But he who reads the Word from doctrine sees all things that confirm it, and many things that are hidden from the eyes of others, and does not permit himself to be drawn away into strange things; and thus his mind becomes so settled as to see with certainty. The Word may be drawn away to confirm heresies unless it is read from doctrine, for the reason that the sense of its letter consists of mere correspondences, and these are in great part appearances of truth, and in part genuine truths, and unless there be doctrine for a lamp these cannot be seen and cannot be distinguished from each other."

[4] That there is such an extension and determination of all man’s thoughts has not been known heretofore, because it has not been known what heaven is and what hell is, thus that they consist of societies, consequently that there is an extension of man’s thoughts into another world than this natural world, into which the sight of his eyes extends. Thus it is the spiritual world into which thought extends, and the natural world into which sight extends, because the thought of the mind is spiritual while the sight of the eye is natural. That all thoughts of man extend into the societies of the spiritual world, and that without such extension no thought is possible, has been made so evident to me by the experience of many years that I can with all faith affirm it to be true.

The Lord’s omnipotence as in the heavens so upon the earth, is what is meant by “the great authority of the angel,” because it is added, that “the earth was lightened by his glory”; for when the last judgment upon those who are meant by “the harlot or Babylon” was accomplished, the darkness that was interposed between heaven and earth was removed. But more upon this below. (Continuation respecting the Athanasian Faith) [2] From what has been said it is clear that the thoughts of man are extensions into societies either heavenly or infernal, and that if there were no extensions there would be no thoughts. For man’s thought is like the sight of his eyes; if sight had no extension out of itself, either there would be no sight or there would be blindness. But it is a man’s love that determines his thoughts into societies, good love determining them into heavenly societies, and evil love into infernal societies; for the entire heaven is arranged into societies, generally, particularly, and most particularly, according to all the varieties of affections belonging to the love; while on the other hand, hell is arranged into societies according to the cupidities of the love of evil, which are opposite to the affections of the love of good."

If the love is good, the thoughts, which are like rays, are truths. If the love is evil, the thoughts, which are like rays, are falsities. Thoughts from a good love, which are truths, tend towards heaven; while thoughts from an evil love, which are falsities, tend towards hell and conjoin themselves with homogeneous societies, that is, with societies of like love, and adapt themselves to them, and ingraft themselves into them, and so intimately that the man is wholly one with them. [4] Through love to the Lord man is an image of the Lord. The Lord is the Divine love; and in heaven before the angels he appears as a sun. From that sun light and heat proceed; the light is the Divine truth and the heat is the Divine good. From these two is the whole heaven, and from them are all the societies of heaven. The Lord’s love in a man who is an image of him is like the fire from that sun, from which fire also light and heat proceed; the light is the truth of faith and the heat is the good of love; both of these are from the Lord, and both are implanted in the societies with which the man’s love acts as one. That man from creation is an image and likeness of God is evident from Genesis (1:26); and he is an image and likeness of the Lord by means of love, because by means of love he is in the Lord and the Lord is in him (John 14:20, 21). In a word, not the least thought can exist unless it finds reception in some society, not in the individuals or angels of the society, but in the affection of love from which and in which that society is; and for this reason the angels are not aware of the influx at all, and such influx in no way disturbs the society. [5] From all this the truth is clear that while man is living in the world he is in conjunction with heaven and also in consociation with angels, although both men and angels are unconscious of it. They are unconscious of it because man’s thought is natural and an angel’s thought is spiritual, and these make one only by correspondence. Because man is inaugurated into societies either of heaven or hell by means of the thoughts of his love, so when he comes into the spiritual world, as he does immediately after death, his character is known merely by the extensions of his thoughts"

And the earth was lightened by his glory, signifies the church now in light from the influx and reception of Divine truth. This is evident from the signification of “the earth,” as being the church (of which frequently); also from the signification of “to be lightened,” as meaning to be in light; also from the signification of “glory,” as being, in reference to the Lord who is here meant by the angel, the Divine truth (see n. 33, 288, 345, 874). That “glory” means the Divine truth, since that is the light of heaven and from it angels have all their wisdom and happiness, and also magnificence, may be seen (n. 678). It is said of the angel coming down out of heaven, that he had “great authority,” and that “the earth was lightened by his glory,” because the last judgment was effected on those who are meant by “the harlot or Babylon,” for this is the meaning of the words of the angel: Fallen, fallen is Babylon, and is become a habitation of demons, and a hold of every unclean spirit, and a hold of every unclean and hateful bird (Rev. 18:2). And when judgment had been effected upon these, the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord came into its power and into its light; for so long as the Babylonians were tolerated under heaven they were like the dense and dusky clouds between heaven and earth by which the rays of light from the sun are intercepted and the day is darkened; and this for the reason that the Divine truth, which is the Word, was not only falsified but also rejected; and moreover, by transferring the Lord’s Divine authority to themselves they annihilated it. These and many other things, so long as they were permitted to make dwelling places for themselves under the heavens, were like dusky clouds between heaven and earth, through which the Divine truth could not pass to enlighten any man of the church. But as soon as they had been driven away and cast into hell, there was an accession of power and light to the Divine truth that proceeded from the Lord as a sun, to the extent that the Lord"

This is why the spiritual sense of the Word was not revealed and the state of heaven and hell manifested until the last judgment had been accomplished, for if before there would have been no power and light in the Divine truth. (Continuation respecting the Athanasian Faith) [2] Since man when born is not in any society either heavenly or infernal, being without thought, and yet is born for eternal life, it follows that in the course of time he either opens heaven or opens hell to himself, and enters into societies, and becomes an inhabitant either of heaven or of hell even while he is in the world. Man becomes an inhabitant of the spiritual world, because that is his real dwelling place, and as it is called, his native land, for there he is to live to eternity after he has lived some years in the natural world. From this it may be concluded how necessary it is for a man to know what it is in him that opens heaven and leads him into its societies, and what it is that opens hell and leads him into its societies. This will be told in the appendices to the following articles. Here let it be said that a man lets himself more and more into the societies of heaven successively according to the increase of wisdom, and into more and more interior societies successively according to the increase of the love of good; also that so far as heaven is opened to him hell is closed. But it is man who opens hell to himself, while it is the Lord who opens heaven to man. 1095. Verse 2.

Verse 2. And he cried out mightily with a great voice, signifies manifestation before heaven and in the church from joy of heart. This is evident from the signification of “crying out,” as being to make manifest, namely, that the last judgment has been effected upon Babylon, for it is added, “Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great.” Also from the signification of “mightily,” as being in power before heaven and in the church (of which in what follows). Also from the signification of “a great voice,” as being joy of heart, for from joy of heart the voice becomes great. The joy of heart was from this, that after the last judgment upon those who are meant by the “harlot” (or “Babylon”), power and light came to the Divine truth that proceeds from the Lord, according to those things which have been said in a preceding article. A “great voice” signifies joy of heart, because every great voice crying out comes from some affection, more intense according to the affection or degree of love. “Mightily” signifies in heaven and on earth, because might signifies power, and there was now the power to make these things manifest before heaven and before the world. That there was now this power, may be seen above (n. 1093).

For such light is like winter light, in which man sees with the same clearness as in summer light, and yet that light does not join itself to the earth, nor to any tree, shrub, flower, or blade of grass. Moreover, every man has implanted in him the faculty of thinking about God, and also of understanding in the light of heaven the things relating to God; but thought alone from that light, which is intellectual thought, merely causes his presence with the Lord and with angels, as has been said.

Goods that have been applied to evils are called adulterated, as for instance, the goods of love to the Lord applied to the loves of self, and the goods of love towards the neighbor applied to the loves of the world. Love to the Lord and love towards the neighbor are pure and holy loves, but the loves of self and of the world, such as they are in those who have claimed to themselves the Lord’s dominion over heaven and over the church, are impure and profane loves; therefore to change holy loves into profane loves is to adulterate the goods of the Word, especially when they call their profane things holy and their evil things good.

Therefore, when man’s thought from light becomes his thought from love he is introduced into heaven as to a marriage, and so far as love is the primary agent in thought from light or leads that thought, man enters heaven as a bride enters the bride chamber, and is wedded. For the Lord is called in the Word a “bridegroom” and a “husband,” and heaven and the church are called a “bride” and a “wife.” “To be wedded” means to be conjoined to heaven in some society of it; and one is so far conjoined to heaven as he has acquired in the world intelligence and wisdom from the Lord through the Word, thus so far as he has learned by means of Divine truths to think that there is a God, and that the Lord is that God. And yet one who thinks from few truths, thus from little intelligence, although he is conjoined with heaven when he thinks from love, is conjoined in its lower parts only. [3] By love, love to the Lord is meant, and loving the Lord does not mean loving him as a person, for by such a love only man is not conjoined to heaven, but by the love of Divine good and Divine truth, which are the Lord in heaven and in the church; and these two are not loved by knowing them, thinking about them, understanding them, and speaking them, but by willing and doing them for the reason that they are commanded by the Lord, and thus because they are uses. Nothing prior is full until it has been done; and the end for the sake of which the thing is done is the love; consequently the love of knowing a thing, of thinking about it, and of understanding it springs from a love of willing and doing it. Tell me why you wish to know and understand anything except for the sake of an end which you love. The end that is loved is the deed.

In David: Let them praise the name of Jehovah, the wild beast and every beast, creeping thing and winged bird (Ps. 148:5, 10). That “the wild beast and beast” signify the affections of the natural man, both of truth and of good, and in the contrary sense the cupidities of falsity and evil, may be seen above (n. 522, 650, 781); therefore “winged bird” signifies thoughts.

That there will then be no infestation from falsities and evils from hell is signified by “the bow, the sword, and the war shall be broken in the earth.” [4] In David: Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands, thou hast put all things under his feet, flocks and herds, yea, the beasts of the fields, the birds of heaven, and the fish of the sea (Ps. 8:6–8)."

For what have these things to do with his dominion, which is in the heavens, and from the heavens over men on the earth, whom he will lead to life eternal? Therefore the spiritual things of the church are what are meant, “flock” signifying in general all things spiritual with man, “herd” all things natural with him that correspond to things spiritual, “beasts of the fields” affections of good in the natural man that pertain to the church (for “field” signifies the church), “birds of heaven” signify the thoughts of the rational man, and “fishes of the sea” knowledges.

Here, too, “tree” signifies the church called Babylon in its beginning and progress, and here that church in the knowledges of truth and good. Its beginning and progress is described in the words, “it became great and strong, the leaf thereof was beautiful, and the flower thereof much, and in it was food for all”; its affections of good and thoughts of truth are signified by “the beast of the field that had shade under it, and the birds that dwelt in its branches.” That it lifted up its dominion over the holy things of the church and of heaven, is meant by “a watcher and a holy one came down from heaven, and cried out, Hew down the tree and cut off his branches.” That “beast and bird” here signify affections and thoughts is evident from its being said, when the tree was cut down, “let the beast flee away from under it, and the birds from his branches.”"

For otherwise why should it be said that “streams from fountains go between the mountains, and give drink to every wild beast of the field; that the wild asses quench their thirst, and by them the bird of the heavens dwells, and utters its voice among the boughs, and the stork in the fir trees”?

Who doth not know from all these that the hand of Jehovah doeth this? (Job 12:7–9). Evidently “beasts, birds of heaven, and fishes of the sea,” do not mean here beasts, birds, and fishes, for these cannot be asked, or teach, or tell, or declare “that the hand of Jehovah doeth this”; but these signify the things that pertain to man’s intelligence, “beasts” meaning his affections, “birds of heaven” his thoughts, and “fishes of the sea” cognitions and knowledges. From these man can teach that the hand of Jehovah doeth it. Unless the things of man’s intelligence were signified by “beasts, birds, and fishes,” it could not be asked, “Who doth not know from all these?” [11] In Ezekiel: Son of man, Say to the bird of every wing, and to every wild beast of the field, Gather yourselves and come, gather yourselves from every side to a great sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel. And I will give my glory among the nations (Ezek. 39:17, 21). This describes the establishment of the church among the nations, and the invitation and calling to it, for it is said, “So will I give my glory among the nations”; therefore “the bird of every wing,” and “every wild beast of the field,” signify all who are in the affection of good and the understanding of truth. [12] So in Revelation: An angel standing in the sun cried out with a great voice, saying to all the birds that fly in the midst of heaven, Come and be gathered together to the supper of the great God (Rev. 19:17)."

I beheld when Carmel was a wilderness, and all its cities were desolated (Jer. 4:24–26). This was said of the devastation of the church as to all its good and truth. “Mountains and valleys” signify celestial and spiritual loves; and “to be moved and overturned” signifies to perish. For in the spiritual world, when there no longer exists in spirits any celestial or spiritual love, the mountains are actually moved and the hills overthrown upon which they dwelt. “All the birds were flown away” signifies that there was no longer any knowledge and consequent thought of truth; “there was no man” signifies no understanding of truth; “Carmel was a wilderness” signifies a church destitute of good and truth; and “its cities desolated” signifies that there were no longer any doctrinals of truth. [14] In the same: The habitations are laid waste, so that no man passeth through, neither do they hear the voice of cattle; from the bird of the heavens even to the beast they have flown away, they have gone; for I will make Jerusalem heaps, a habitation of dragons (Jer. 9:10–11; 12:9). Here, too, the devastation of the church is described. “The habitations that are laid waste, so that no man passeth through,” signify the doctrinals of the church which were from the Word, in which now there is no good or truth; “the voice of cattle which they do not hear,” signifies good of charity and truth of faith, of which there is none; “the birds of the heavens and even the beasts are flown away, they have gone” signifies that there is no longer any thought of truth from the knowledge of it, nor any affection of good.

Here a church to be established by the Lord is treated of. 1100d.

In many passages of the Word it is said that men “should be given for food to birds and wild beasts,” which signifies that they would altogether perish by fallacies, falsities, consequent reasonings, cupidities of evil, and in general by evils and falsities from hell. This is signified by “being given for food to the birds of heaven and the beasts of the earth” in the following passages. In Jeremiah: The carcass of this people shall be for food to the bird of the heavens, none shall frighten them away (Jer. 7:33). I will visit upon you in four kinds, with the sword to kill, and with dogs to drag about, and with the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the earth to devour and to destroy (Jer. 15:3).

Its devastation by horrible falsities is signified by “the bird of abominations”; that falsity is here meant by “bird” is clearly evident. It is to be known that there are many kinds of falsities, and that each of them is signified by its own kind of bird; and these are enumerated in Moses (Lev. 11:13 seq.; and Deut. 14:11–20), and are mentioned in various parts of the Word, as the eagle, the kite, the woodpecker, the raven, the screech owl, the spoonbill, the heron, the owl, the horned owl, the dragon, and others.

This doctrine is such that when it is read it leaves a clear idea that there are three persons, and thus that there are three unanimous gods, but an obscure idea that God is one; and yet, as has been said above, the idea of thought of one God is what primarily opens heaven to man, and on the other hand the idea of three gods closes heaven. Whether this Athanasian doctrine, when it has been read, leaves a clear idea that there are three persons, and thus three unanimous gods, and whether this unanimous trinity gives rise to the thought that there is one God, let everyone consider from his own thought about it. For it is said in the Athanasian Faith in plain words, “There is one person of the Father, another of the Son, and another of the Holy Spirit. The Father is uncreate, infinite, eternal, almighty, God, Lord.” Likewise is the Son, and likewise the Holy Spirit. Also, “The Father was made and created of none; the Son was born of the Father; and the Holy Spirit proceedeth from both. Thus there is one Father, one Son, and one Holy Spirit. And in this trinity the whole three persons are co-eternal and co-equal.” From all this no one can think otherwise than that there are three gods; neither could Athanasius nor the Nicene Council think otherwise; as is evident from these words inserted in the doctrine, “Like as we are compelled by the Christian verity to acknowledge every person by himself to be God and Lord, yet we cannot from Christian faith make mention of three gods or three lords.” This cannot be understood otherwise than that it is allowable to acknowledge three gods and lords, but not to name them, or that it is allowable to think that there are three gods and lords, but not to say it. 1103.

(Continuation respecting the Athanasian Faith) That the doctrine of the trinity that is called the Athanasian Faith when it has been read leaves an obscure idea that God is one, and so obscure as not to remove the idea of three gods, can be seen from this, that the doctrine makes one God out of three through a unity of essence, saying, “This is the Christian faith: that we worship one God in trinity, and trinity in unity, neither confounding the persons nor dividing the essence.” And afterwards, “So that in all things the unity in trinity and the trinity in unity is to be worshipped.” This was said to remove the idea of three gods, but it enters the understanding in no other way than that there are three persons, although they all have one Divine essence, that is, by Divine essence God is here meant; and yet essence, like divinity, majesty, and glory, which are also mentioned, is something predicated, and God because a person is the subject; consequently to say that the essence is God would be like saying that something predicated is the subject. But the essence is not God; it belongs to God, as majesty and glory are not God but belong to God, just as what is predicated is not the subject, but belongs to the subject. This makes evident that the idea of three gods as three persons is not removed. This may be illustrated by a comparison. Suppose that there are in one kingdom three rulers of equal power, each called king; then if power and majesty are meant by king, these might, if it were so commanded, be called and declared king, although it would not be easy to call them one king. But as a person is meant when a king is mentioned, it is impossible from any command for three kings to be thought of as one king. If, therefore, they should say to you, Speak to us as freely as you think, you would certainly say, Ye kings and Your Majesties. If you answer, As I am commanded to speak so do I think, you are deceived, because either you are pretending or you are compelling yourself, and if you are compelling yourself, your thought is not left to itself, but inheres in your words."

Athanasius added the above words to the others, because no one, not even himself, could think otherwise. But everyone can speak otherwise, and ought so to speak in all things, because it is taught by the Christian religion, that is, from the Word, that there is one God and not three gods.

This is evident from the signification of “merchants,” as being those who acquire the knowledges of good and truth from the Word, that is, who either teach or learn them; for in the proper or natural sense he is called a merchant who buys and sells merchandise, and to buy and to sell signify to acquire and communicate, thus in the spiritual sense to learn and to teach; and “merchandise” signifies the knowledges of good and truth from the Word. (That this is the signification of “trading,” see above, n. 840.) “The merchants of the earth” signify instruction in the things of the church, because to teach is to instruct, and to be taught or to learn is to be instructed, and the term instruction is applicable to both; and as the spiritual sense of the Word is abstracted from persons, “merchant” signifies instruction, and the natural sense from the spiritual signifies those who instruct and who are instructed; for the spiritual sense has respect to goods and truths abstracted from persons, while the natural sense from the spiritual has respect to the persons in whom are these goods and truths.

The above is evide nt also from the signification of “the abundance of her luxuries,” as being the things of the church that are called knowledges, and that are said to be holy, and yet derive all that they are from the love of having dominion both over heaven and over the world. Such knowledges, which they call the holy things of the church, are what are meant by “the abundance of her luxuries” which are enumerated below (verses 11–15), and by which such things are signified.

The clear idea that the Lord has the Divine and the human is drawn from these words, “The true faith is, that we believe and confess that our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is God and man; God of the substance of the Father, begotten before the world, and man of the substance of the mother, born in the world; Perfect God and perfect man, consisting of a reasonable soul and a human body; equal to the Father as to the Divine, and inferior to the Father as to the human.” Here the clear idea stops and goes no farther, because it becomes from what follows an obscure idea, and what pertains to an obscure idea, since it does not enter the memory from thought from light, gains no other place there than among things not of light; and as these do not appear before the understanding they are hidden, and cannot be called forth from the memory in connection with things that belong to the light.

And if they are asked where his Divine is, they answer according to their idea, In heaven with the Father. They thus say and think because they have an aversion to thinking that the human is Divine, and is in heaven united with its Divine, not knowing that when they thus separate in thought the Lord’s Divine from his human they not only think contrary to their doctrine, which teaches that the Lord’s Divine is in his human as the soul in the body, and that there is a unity of person, that is, that they constitute one person, but they also charge that doctrine undeservedly with the contradiction or fallacy that the Lord’s human with its rational soul was from the mother alone, when in fact every man is rational from the soul, which is from the father. But that there is such a thought and such a separation is a result of the idea of three gods, according to which his Divine in the human is from the Divine of the Father, who is the first person, although it is his own Divine which descended from heaven and took on the human. If man does not rightly perceive this it might perhaps be supposed that the Father, who is the source, is not one Divine but threefold; and yet this cannot be accepted with any faith. In a word, those who separate the Divine from his human, and do not think that the Divine is in his human as the soul is in the body, and that the two are one person, may fall into strange ideas about the Lord, even into an idea like that of a man separated from his soul.

I have questioned very many about this, even primates of the church, and they have all answered that it is so; and when I have said that it is according to the doctrine in the Athanasian Faith, which is the very doctrine of their church respecting God and respecting the Lord, that the Lord’s Divine is in his human as the soul is in the body, they have replied that they did not know it; and when I recited these words of the doctrine: “Our Lord Jesus Christ is the Son of God, although he be God and man, yet he is not two but one Christ; one altogether by unity of person. For as the reasonable soul and body is one man, so God and man is one Christ,” they were silent, but afterwards confessed that they had not observed these words, and were indignant that they had passed over their own doctrine with eyes so closed; and some of them abandoned their mystical union of the Divine of the Father with the Lord’s human. [5] That the Divine is in the Lord’s human as the soul is in the body the Word teaches and testifies in Matthew and in Luke. In Matthew: When Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Spirit. And an angel said to Joseph in a dream, Fear not to take Mary thy bride, for that which is begotten in her is of the Holy Spirit. And Joseph knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son, and he called his name Jesus (Matt. 1:18, 20, 25)."

Mary said to the angel, How shall this be, since I know not a man? The angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Spirit shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee, therefore that holy one that is born of thee shall be called the Son of God (Luke 1:31–32, 34–35). All this makes clear that the Divine was in the Lord from conception, and that the Divine was his life from the Father, which life is the soul. This will suffice for the time. More will be said on this subject in what follows, where it will be shown that even the things in the Athanasian doctrine that produce an obscure idea of the Lord are in harmony with the truth when the trinity, that is, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, is thought and believed to be in the Lord as in one person. Without this thought and belief it may be said, and in fact it is said, that Christians, differently from all other peoples and nations in the whole globe that have rationality, worship three gods; and yet the Christian world might surpass and ought to surpass all others in the clearness of the doctrine and belief that God is one both in essence and in person. 1105.

That this is what is meant by “a voice from heaven” is evident from what follows, for it is said, “Come forth out of her, my people, that ye become not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues,” with other things besides; and after this is described what the wares of Babylon are, and what their state is; which makes clear that “a voice from heaven” means exhortation. There was heard “a voice from heaven,” because it means from the Lord through the Word; for everything that a man imbibes from the Word is a voice from heaven, and the Word teaches everyone what Babylon is, as is evident from the passages quoted from the Word respecting Babylon (n. 1029). [2] It is said “another voice,” because the former voice was that of the angel crying out that “Babylon had fallen, and was become the habitation of demons”; so this is an exhortation to all, both to those within Babylon who are in some affection of truth and in some life of good, that they should come forth out of her and have no faith in her witchcrafts and enchantments; and also to those who are out of Babylon, that they do not permit themselves to be led away by such. For it is the character of that nation to persuade by the delights of each one’s love, and thus close up the understanding, and thereby lead man into a belief in everything they say. That the Babylonish nation is such has been made known to me by much experience; for they enter into the delights of each one’s life, and thereby captivate minds; and thus they as it were spread the bait, and ensnare, until they get into one’s life; and thus they lead him like one blind and powerless wherever they wish, leading him first to accept a blind faith by removing all light from the understanding in theological matters, in order that their ends may not become evident, which are that they may be lords not only over man’s interiors that pertain to his mind but also over the exteriors that pertain to the body; over the interiors pertaining to the mind by dominion over all things of the church and of heaven, thus over souls, and over the exteriors pertaining to the body by dominion"

In a word, their ends are that they may themselves alone be lords and all others servants, for thus are they worshipped as gods, if not by open words, yet in silent acknowledgment; and this is their final end, which is concealed from men but is manifest to the angels in heaven. That this is their final end is clearly evident from this, that they have taken away from the Lord himself all power to save, by transferring it to the pope and from him to his ministers; and yet the saving of man is the Lord’s Divine itself; and he who is able to do this is not a man but God. But more will be said upon this subject in what follows. (Continuation respecting the Athanasian Faith) [3] It has been shown that the doctrine of faith that has its name from Athanasius, leaves a clear idea, when it is read, that there are three persons, and thus that there are three unanimous gods, and an obscure idea that God is one, so obscure that the idea of three gods is not removed. And again, this doctrine leaves a clear idea that the Lord has the Divine and the human, that is, that the Lord is God and man, but an obscure idea that the Divine and the human of the Lord are one person, and that his Divine is in his human as the soul is in the body. It has been also said that all things in that doctrine from beginning to end, both such as are clear and such as are obscure, nevertheless agree and coincide with the truth, if only instead of saying that God is one in essence and three in person, it is believed, as the truth really is, that God is one both in essence and in person. [4] There is a trinity in God and there is also a unity. That there is a trinity is evident from the passages in the Word where the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are mentioned; and that there is a unity, from the passages in the Word where it is said that God is one. The unity in which there is the trinity, or the one God in whom there is a trine, does not exist in the Divine that is called the Father, nor in the Divine that is called the Holy Spirit, but in the Lord alone. In the Lord alone there is a trine, namely, the Divine"

Afterwards it will be established in general, that the trine is in the Lord; and next in particular, that the Divine that is called the Father is the Lord, that the Divine that is called the Son is the Lord, and that the Divine that is called the Holy Spirit is the Lord. 1107. Come forth out of her, my people, signifies that they should leave them and not communicate with them. This is evident from the signification of “coming forth out of Babylon,” as being to leave those who are meant by “Babylon,” also not to communicate with them. Also from the signification of “my people,” as being those who are in truths, and through truths in the good of life. (That “people” signifies those who are in truths from good may be seen, n. 175b, 331, 625.) These are the subjects of the exhortation that is meant by “the voice from heaven.” They were exhorted to leave such, and not to communicate with them, because interaction with such is dangerous, especially in the spiritual world, where they send out emissaries, as they do in the natural world, and these persuade others in various ways and entice them by promises that they may accede to their religion; for as a man acts in the world so he acts after his departure out of the world, for the ruling love with everyone remains, and the love of such is to bring all the world over to their religious persuasion, and this for no other end than that they may extend the boundaries of their empire for the sake of the infernal delight of the love of self and the infernal delight of the love of the world. It is for the sake of these delights that the devil, as it is said, walks about and leads astray, as can be seen from what is said in the Gospels about the Lord’s temptations by the devil, where the love of self in which he is, is described by his wishing to be adored, and his love of the world by his showing from a"

As everyone’s love continues the same after death, so is it with the Babylonish nation when it has come into the spiritual world; then those who have exercised dominion from the delight of those loves, acquire arts unknown in the natural world, and by these they fascinate men’s spirits and draw them over to their side against their will. And now since the last judgment has been accomplished upon these, they are strictly forbidden to send emissaries into societies in which the Reformed are, or to the Gentiles; and when any are sent they are sought out and punished. As the state of such after the last judgment, especially their state in the spiritual world, is here treated of, what is said here and in the following parts of this chapter about Babylon must be understood as said chiefly on their account. For as regards Babylon in the natural world or on our earth, those meant by Babylon there are not in the same state as those who are in the spiritual world, and yet the exhortation is also for them, that they may take heed to themselves. (Continuation respecting the Athanasian Faith) [2] Now in regard to the agreement of all things of the Athanasian doctrine with this truth, that God is one both in essence and person, in whom is a trine, to establish this agreement and make it clear I will proceed in the following order. The Athanasian doctrine first teaches thus: “the Catholic faith is this: that we worship one God in trinity, and trinity in unity; neither confounding the persons nor dividing the essence.” When in place of three persons one person in whom is the trine is understood, this is in itself a truth, and in a clear idea is thus seen; the Christian faith is this: we worship one God in whom is a trine, and a trine in one God; and the God in whom is the trine is one person, and the trine in God is one essence; thus there is one God in a trinity, and a trinity in the unity; and neither are the persons confounded nor is the essence divided. That the persons are not confounded and the essence is not divided will appear more clearly from what follows. The Athanasian doctrine further teaches: “for there is one person of the Father, another of the Son, and another of the Holy Spirit;"

Again, “Such as the Father is, such is the Son, and such is the Holy Spirit.” These words are to be understood thus: such as is the Divine that is called the Father, such is the Divine that is called the Son, and such is the Divine that is called the Holy Spirit. [3] And further, “The Father is uncreate, the Son is uncreate, and the Holy Spirit is uncreate. The Father is infinite, the Son is infinite, and the Holy Spirit is infinite; the Father eternal, the Son eternal, the Holy Spirit eternal, and yet there are not three eternals, but one eternal. Also there are not three infinites, but one infinite; neither are there three uncreates, but one uncreate. As the Father is almighty the Son is almighty and the Holy Spirit almighty; and yet they are not three almighties, but one almighty.” When in place of three persons one person in whom is a trine is understood, this also in itself is a truth, and in a clear idea is thus seen: as the Divine in the Lord that is called the Father is uncreate, infinite, almighty, so the Divine human that is called the Son is uncreate, infinite, almighty, and the Divine that is called the Holy Spirit is uncreate, infinite, and almighty; but these three are one; because the Lord is one God, both in essence and in person, in whom is a trine. Again, in the Athanasian doctrine this follows: “as the Father is God so the Son is God and the Holy Spirit is God; and yet there are not three gods, but one God. So likewise the Father is Lord, the Son is Lord, and the Holy Spirit is Lord; and yet there are not three Lords, but one Lord.” Here again, when in place of three persons one person in whom is a trine is understood, this in a clear idea is thus seen: the Lord from his Divine that is called the Father, from his Divine human that is called the Son, and from his Divine proceeding that is called the Holy Spirit, is one God and one Lord; since the three"

[4] Still again: “for like as we are compelled by the Christian verity to acknowledge every person by himself to be God and Lord, so are we forbidden by the Catholic religion to say there be three gods or three lords.” Elsewhere thus: “like as we are bound by Christian truth to acknowledge every person to be God and Lord, so we cannot in Christian faith make mention of three gods or three lords.” This can be understood in no other way than that by Christian truth we cannot help acknowledging and thinking three gods and three lords, yet it is not permitted by the Christian faith and religion to speak of and name three gods or three lords. And this is what is done, for most people think of three gods who are of one mind, and consequently call them a unanimous trinity, and yet they are bound to say one God. But with the idea that there are not three persons but one person, in place of these words, which ought to be expunged from the Athanasian doctrine, this might be said: “when we acknowledge a trine in the Lord, then it is from truth, and thus from the Christian faith and religion, that we acknowledge both with the lips and the heart, one God and one Lord.” For if it were permissible to acknowledge and think of three it would be permissible also to believe in three, for believing or belief belongs to the thought and acknowledgment and to the speech therefrom, and not to the speech separately. [5] Afterwards this follows: “the Father was made of none, neither created nor begotten. The Son is of the Father alone, not made nor created, but begotten. The Holy Spirit is of the Father and of the Son, neither made nor created nor begotten, but proceeding. So there is one Father, not three fathers; one Son, not three sons; one Holy Spirit, not three holy spirits.” This is wholly in agreement with the truth if by the Father the Divine of the Lord that is called the Father is meant, and if by the Son his Divine human is meant, and if by the Holy Spirit his Divine proceeding is meant; for from the Divine that is called the Father the Divine human that is called the Son was begotten, and from both the Divine that is called the Holy Spirit proceeds.

All this makes clear that the Athanasian doctrine agrees with the truth that God is one both in essence and in person, if only in place of three persons one person, in whom is a trine that is called Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, is understood. In the following article a like agreement will be established respecting the unity of person in the Lord. 1108. That ye become not partakers of her sins, signifies lest ye come into their evils which are from the love of self and from the love of the world. This is evident from the signification of “becoming partakers,” as being in reference to sins to come into them, and thus to become guilty of them. Also from the signification of “sins,” as being here the evils that spring from the love of self and the love of the world. Such evils are here meant because the Babylonish nation is in those loves, and consequently in the evils that arise from them. That that nation is in such evils is evident, for those of that nation extend their dominion not only over all things of the church but also over heaven; nor are they content with that; they have extended their dominion over the Lord himself, for they have transferred to themselves his power over the souls of men to save them, which power is the Lord’s very Divine power, since it was for this end that the Lord came into the world and glorified his human, that is, made it Divine, that he might thereby save men. They have evidently extended their dominion over the Lord himself, for having transferred to themselves his Divine power, which is the power to save men, they believe that the Lord will do what they wish, and not that they are to do what the Lord wishes; thus their will rules and the Lord’s will serves; in a word, they have drawn down the Lord from his throne, and set themselves upon it, saying in their hearts, like Lucifer: And thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into the heavens, I will exalt my throne above the stars of heaven, I will ascend above the heights of the cloud, I will become like the most high (Isa. 14:13–14). That “Lucifer” here means Babylon may be seen above (n. 1029d), but the modern Babylon has made herself not merely like the Most High, but even higher. Now as those who are meant by “Babylon” are in the loves of self and of the world above all others in the"

(Continuation respecting the Athanasian Faith) [2] Now as to the agreement of the Athanasian doctrine with this truth, that the Lord’s human is Divine from the Divine that was in him from conception. That the Lord’s human is Divine appears as if it were not in the Athanasian doctrine, and yet it is, as is evident from these words in the doctrine: “our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is God and man; Who although he be God and man, yet he is not two but one Christ; one altogether by unity of person”(others, because they are one person). For as the reasonable soul and body are one man, so God and man is one Christ.” Now as the soul and body are one man, and thus one person, and such as the soul is such is the body, it follows that as his soul from the Father was Divine, his body also, which is his human, is Divine. He took, indeed, a body or a human from the mother, but this he put off in the world and put on a human from the Father, and this is the Divine human. It is said in the doctrine, “Equal to the Father as touching the Divine, and inferior to the Father as touching the human.” This, too, agrees with the truth when the human from the mother is meant, as it is here. Again, in the doctrine it is said, “God and man is one Christ, one not by conversion of the Divine essence into the human, but by the taking of the human essence into the Divine. One altogether, not by confusion of substance, but by unity of person.” This, too, agrees with the truth, since the soul does not change itself into body, nor so mingle itself with body as to become body, but it takes a body to itself. Thus soul and body, although the two are distinct, are still one man, and in respect to the Lord, one Christ, that is, one man who is God. More will be said on the Lord’s Divine human in what follows."

This is evident from the signification of “plagues,” as being such things as destroy man’s spiritual life (see above, n. 584), here falsities from evil, because these destroy that life. The appearance is that the evils themselves destroy man’s spiritual life, but they do not destroy it of themselves, but by means of falsities, and for the reason that evils without falsities do not enter the thought; for evils belong wholly to the will, and anything that belongs to the will and not at the same time to the thought cannot destroy, because it is without reason, and then man does not know that it is an evil. But when man confirms evils by the thought they do destroy, for they then are man’s. Confirmations of evils by the thought are falsities. “Plagues” here signify falsities, because “sins,” which are mentioned just before, mean evils of the love of self and of the world, and in the Word wherever evil is treated of falsity is also treated of. Now as evils destroy spiritual life by means of falsities, and “plagues” signify falsities from evil, so “plagues” signify destruction. (Continuation respecting the Athanasian Faith) [2] It was from the Divine providence that each and every thing of the Athanasian doctrine respecting the trinity and respecting the Lord is a truth and is harmonious, when in place of three persons one person in whom is the trinity is understood, and it is believed that the Lord is that person. For at that time, if the trinity of persons had not been accepted, they would have become either Arians or Socinians, and consequently the Lord would have been acknowledged as a mere man and not as God; and by this the Christian church would have been destroyed, and heaven would have been closed to the man of the church; for no one is conjoined with heaven, and after death admitted into heaven, unless in the idea of his thought he sees God as man, and at the same time believes God to be one both in essence and in person, for it is by this that the Gentiles are saved; also unless he acknowledges the Lord, his Divine and his human, for by this a man of the Christian church is saved, provided he lives at the same time as a Christian."

Neither would the Reformed have seen the Divine in the human of the Lord, for those who are in faith separated from charity do not see this. Nevertheless both of them acknowledge the Divine of the Lord in a trinity of persons. And yet this doctrine that is called the Athanasian Faith was by the Lord’s Divine providence so written that all things in it are truths, provided that in place of three persons one person in whom is a trine is recognized, and it is believed that the Lord is that person. Moreover, it was from providence that they are called persons, for a person is a man, and a Divine person is God who is man. This has been revealed at this day for the sake of the new church, which is called the holy Jerusalem. 1110. Verse 5.

Nevertheless, the Lord provides that those who are in evils, especially those who are in the evils that are the worst of all, be removed afar off from heaven, that the angels may not be infested by them.

From the Word: where the Lord himself teaches that the Father and he are one, and that the Holy Spirit proceeds from him and from the Father; also where the Lord teaches that the Father is in him and he in the Father, and that the spirit of truth, which is the Holy Spirit, does not speak from himself but from the Lord; and again, from passages in the Old Word where the Lord is called “Jehovah,” “Son of God,” and “the holy one of Israel.” [3] From the Divine essence: that one Divine by itself is not possible, but there must be a trine. This trine is being [esse], manifesting [existere], and proceeding [procedere], for being must necessarily be manifested, and when it is manifested it must proceed that it may produce. And this trine is one in essence and one in person, and is God. This may be illustrated by a comparison.

By this trine an angel is an image of God, and is called a “son of God,” and also an “heir,” and even a “god”; nevertheless, an angel is not life from himself, but is a recipient of life; God alone is life from himself. [4] From heaven: the Divine trine, which is one in essence and in person, is such in heaven. The Divine called the Father, and the Divine human called the Son, appear in heaven before the angels as a sun, and the Divine that proceeds therefrom appears as light united to heat; the light is Divine truth, and the heat is Divine good. Thus the Divine called the Father is the Divine being, the Divine human called the Son is the Divine manifesting from that being, and the Divine called the Holy Spirit is the Divine proceeding from the Divine manifesting and from the Divine being. This trine is the Lord in heaven; his Divine love is what appears there as a sun. 1112. And God hath remembered her injustices, signifies that falsities from evils have separated them from the Lord. This is evident from the signification of “remembering,” in reference to God as being to separate him from themselves (of which presently); also from the signification of “injustices,” as being falsities from evil, for “the just” is truth from good, consequently “the unjust” is falsity from evil. “The just” is truth from good because civil justice is nothing else than civil truth, which is of the law, and civil equity is the good that is also of the law, since as the law wills justice so it wills equity; for as all truth must be from good so all justice must be from equity; and as all truth must be of good so all justice must be of equity, and conversely.

It must be understood, however, that the Lord does not separate himself from such, but that they separate themselves from the Lord; for the Lord regards everyone from the face and not from the back of the head; and for this reason the angels of heaven have the Lord continually before their face, and this whichever way they turn, but evil spirits turn the face away from the Lord and turn to him the back part of the head, and thus they separate themselves from him. The falsities from evils that are with them are what do this. (That the angels of heaven thus turn to the Lord, and that the spirits of hell thus turn away from him, may be seen in Heaven and Hell, n. 17, 123, 142–145, 151, 251, 272, 548, 552, 561.) (Continuation respecting the Athanasian Faith and respecting the Lord) [3] It has been said that one Divine by itself is not possible, but that there must be a trine, and that this trine is one God in essence and in person. It may now be asked, What trine God had before the Lord took on the human and made it Divine in the world? God was then likewise man, and had the Divine, the Divine human, and the Divine proceeding, that is, the Divine being [esse], the Divine manifesting [existere], and the Divine proceeding [procedere], for as has been said, God without a trine is not possible. But the Divine human was not then Divine even to ultimates. Ultimates are meant by “flesh and bones,” and even these were made Divine by the Lord when he was in the world. This was what was added, and this is the Divine human that God now has. This, too, may be illustrated by this comparison. Every angel is a man, having a soul, having a body, and having a proceeding; and yet this does not make him a complete man, for he does not have flesh and bones as a man in the world has."

From this it follows that now God is man more than an angel is. Comparison has been made with an angel and with a man; yet it must be understood that God has life in himself, while an angel does not have life in himself, for he is a recipient of life. That the Lord as to both the Divine and the Divine human is life in himself, he teaches in John: As the Father hath life in himself so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself (John 5:26). Here by “Father” the Lord means the Divine in himself; for he says elsewhere that the Father is in him, and that the Father and he are one. 1113. Verse 6.

There are several reasons why Christians have formed such ideas of God. The first is that they believe from their doctrine in three Divine persons distinct from each other; in the Father as the invisible God, and in the Lord, but not God as to his human. The second reason is that they believe God to be a spirit, and they conceive of a spirit as wind or as air or ether, and yet every spirit is a man. The third reason is that Christians, in consequence of their faith alone without life, have become worldly, and from the love of self have become corporeal, and the worldly and corporeal man does not see God except from space, thus as the whole inmost in the universe or in nature, consequently as extended. But God must not be regarded from space, for in the spiritual world there is no space; space there is an appearance from something like it.

But these ideas of God are not so much the ideas of the simple as of the intelligent, for many of the intelligent are blinded by the pride of self intelligence, and are in consequence infatuated by what they know, according to the Lord’s words in Matthew (11:25; 13:13–15).

This is evident from the signification of “doubling double,” as being to make much retribution, or to render much punishment (of which presently); also from the signification of “works,” as being profanations of good, for the works of such are profanations; therefore “doubling double” signifies as much retribution as they have profaned good. “Doubling double” has this signification because “two” does not signify two, nor does any number signify the quantity of the thing, but its quality, and two signifies the quality of a thing as to union, and is predicated of good and of evil (see above, n. 532, 984); and here “double” is predicated of the retribution of evil on account of the profanation of good; from which it is clear that “double” here does not mean double, but much of evil. [2] That “double” is predicated of retribution and of remuneration, and signifies much, is evident from these passages in the Word. In Jeremiah: Let my persecutors be ashamed, bring upon them the day of evil, and break them with a double breaking (Jer. 17:18)."

[3] In Isaiah: Comfort ye, my people, and speak unto the heart of Jerusalem that her warfare is accomplished and that her iniquity is pardoned, for she hath received from the hand double for all her sins (Isa. 40:1–2). This is said of the Lord’s coming and of a new church to be established by him.

That every man in the idea of his spirit sees God as man has been made evident to me by men after death, who are then in the ideas of the spirit; for after death a man becomes a spirit, and then it is impossible for him to think of God otherwise than as man. An experiment was made whether they could think otherwise, and for this purpose they were let down into the state in which they had been in the world, and then they thought about God. The thought of some was that of the universe, others that of nature in her inmost, others that of a cloud in midair, others that of a beam of light, and others thought in other ways; but the moment they came out of that state into a state of the spirit they thought of God as man. At this they were surprised, and declared that it was something implanted in every spirit. But evil spirits who have denied God in the world deny him also after death, and yet in place of God they worship some spirit, who gains power over the rest by diabolical arts. [5] It has been said that to think of God as man has been implanted in every spirit. That this comes through an influx of the Lord into the interiors of their thoughts is evident from the fact that the angels of all the heavens acknowledge the Lord alone. They acknowledge his Divine which is called the Father, they see his Divine human, and they are in the Divine proceeding, for the whole angelic heaven is the Lord’s Divine proceeding. An angel is not an angel from what is his own, but from the Divine that he receives from the Lord. From this they are in the Lord; consequently when they think of God they can think of no other than the Lord in whom they are and from whom they think. Add to this that the whole angelic heaven in its complex before the Lord is as one man, which may be called the greatest man; consequently the angels in heaven are in the man that is the Lord’s Divine proceeding, as has been said; and since their thoughts have direction there according to the form of heaven, they are unable when they think of God to think of any other than the Lord.

This is evident from the signification of “cup,” as being truth, and in the contrary sense falsity, for “cup” has a similar signification as “wine” (see above, n. 887, 1045). Also from the signification of “to mingle,” as being to profane, for he who mingles falsity with truth or truth with falsity profanes (of which presently). Also from the signification of “double,” as being much, and as said of retribution (see just above, n. 1115). “To mingle” signifies to profane, because it is predicated of the wine that is in the cup, which signifies truth, and in the contrary sense falsity; and when truth and falsity are mingled profanation takes place (see above, n. 1053–1063). “To mingle” has this signification in David: There is a cup in the hand of Jehovah, and he hath mingled it with wine, he hath filled it with the mixture, and hath poured it out therefrom; but the dregs of it all the wicked of the earth shall suck out and drink (Ps. 75:8). “The cup in the hand of Jehovah,” and the “wine,” signify the Divine truth; “to mingle” and “mixture” signify profanation, for the mingling of falsity with truth is meant; “he hath poured it out therefrom, but the dregs of it all the wicked of the earth shall suck out and drink,” signifies the punishment of profanation; all of which makes clear that “mingling the cup” has the same meaning here as in Revelation.

They distributed divinity among so many persons, because from intuition they saw God as man, and therefore viewed all the attributes, properties, and qualities of God as persons, and thence also the virtues, affections, inclinations, and knowledges as persons. It was also from intuition that the inhabitants of the countries round about Canaan, as well as those of the regions within it, worshiped Baalim, Ashtaroth, Beelzebub, Chemosh, Milcom, Molech, and others, some of whom had lived as men. [3] Again, it is from intuition that in Christian gentilism at this day there are those who worship saints as gods, bending the knee before their idols, kissing them, baring the head before them in the ways where they are set up, and worshiping at their graves; and even doing the same to the pope, whose shoes and even his footsteps they press with their lips, and would salute him as a god if religion allowed it. These and other practices are from an intuition, that is, a desire to worship a visible god, and not an airy something which is nothing but smoke to them. But the idea of God as man that flows in from heaven is so perverted with many that either a man of the world or an idol is worshiped in place of God, comparatively as the bright light of the sun is turned into colors not beautiful, and its summer heat into foul stenches, according to the objects upon which they fall.

Those, therefore, who have glorified themselves much and have taken delight in the love of having dominion over heaven and over the church, and for the sake of that glory and consequent delight have perverted the goods of heaven and the church which belong to the Word, have their lot in a hell more grievous in respect to torment; while those who have glorified and delighted themselves less in such things have their lot in a milder hell; and those who have not glorified themselves at all, and thus have not perverted the goods and truths of heaven and the church, which are from the Word, but have simply rendered obedience to them either ignorantly or from persuasion, do not have their lot in hell; and such people as have no part in dominion, especially those who look to the Lord and have some affection of truth, have their lot in the heavens, where they are taught by the angels.

This psalm treats of the Lord and his kingdom; and “kings’ daughters” among the precious ones signify the affections of truth, which are said to be “among the precious ones” because “precious” is predicated in the Word of truths; “the queen who stands at the right hand in gold of Ophir,” signifies the church from the reception of good from the Lord; for all things with man that belong to his right side have reference to good from which is truth, and those belonging to the left side have reference to truth from good, and this is why it is said that “the queen stands at the right hand.” Also “the gold of Ophir” signifies good.

For the marriage of man [vir] and woman is a complete likeness of the marriage of truth and good; since a man is born to be the understanding of truth, consequently that predominates in him, and woman is born to be the affection of good, consequently that predominates in her; and as good and truth mutually love each other and will to be conjoined, so do the understanding of truth and the affection or will of good.

This, too, is said of Babylon, and it has the same signification as these words in Revelation, “A widow I am not, and mourning I shall not see, for this reason in one day shall her plagues come to thee, death, and mourning, and famine.” Elsewhere in the Word “widows” signify those, both women and males, who are in good and not in truth and yet desire truth, thus those who are without defense against falsity and evil, but who are defended by the Lord. The term is used also in the contrary sense, as in Isaiah 9:17; 10:1, 2; Jer. 15:7–9; 22:3; 49:10–11; Lam. 5:3; Ezek. 22:6–7; David, Psalm 68:9; Psalm 146:9; Exod. 22:21–24; Deut. 10:18; 27:19; Matt. 23:14; Luke 20:47; and elsewhere."

But the life that is God can create forms out of substances that are not life, in which it can be, and give to them the appearance of living. Such forms are men; and since they are receptacles of life they could not when first created be anything else than images and likenesses of God; images from the reception of truth and likenesses from the reception of good; for life and its recipient are fitted to each other as the active and passive, but do not mingle. For this reason human forms, which are recipients of life, live, not from themselves, but from God who alone is life; consequently, as is well known, every good of love and every truth of faith is from God, and nothing of these is from man; for if man had the least portion of life as his own he would be able to will and do good from himself, and to understand and believe truth from himself, and thus to claim merit; and yet if he so believes, the form recipient of life closes itself above and becomes perverted, and intelligence perishes. Good and its love and truth and its faith are the life that is God, for God is good itself and truth itself; and therefore in these God dwells in man. And from all this it follows, that man of himself is nothing, and is something only so far as he receives from the Lord, and at the same time acknowledges that it is not his own but is the Lord’s; then the Lord gives him to be something; yet not from himself but from the Lord. 1122. And mourning I shall not see, signifies that they will never be in desolation and will not perish. This is evident from the signification of “not to see mourning” (when predicated of a “widow,” which signifies defense) as being to be desolated and perish. “Mourning” here has reference to dominion and to its having no end. Moreover, such things the Babylonians say in their hearts, because they have fortified themselves by every art. This they have done by having ingratiated and by continually ingratiating themselves by means of the delights of earthly and"

These defenses pertain, however, to those who are on earth, and not to those who are in the spiritual world; where no one has any longer the refuge they had before the last judgment. For when they come thither after death they are immediately separated, and those who have exercised dominion from the love of self are cast into hell, and the others are sent away into societies. Thus Babylon at this day has been desolated and has perished. (Continuation respecting the Athanasian Faith and respecting the Lord) [2] The appearance to man is that he lives from himself, but this is a fallacy; if it were not a fallacy man would be able to love God from himself, and be wise from himself. The appearance is that life is in man, because it flows in from the Lord into his inmosts, which are far removed from the sight of his thought, and thus from perception; also for the reason that the principal cause which is life and the instrumental cause which is a recipient of life act together as one cause, and this is felt in the instrumental cause which is the recipient, that is, in man, as if it were in him. It is exactly the same as our feeling that the light, which is the cause of sight, is in the eye, and that sound, which is the cause of hearing, is in the ear, and that the volatile particles in the air that cause smell are in the nose, that the soluble particles of food that cause taste are on the tongue; when the truth is that the eyes, the ears, the nose, and the tongue, are recipient organized substances, that is, instrumental causes, while light, sound, the volatile particles in the air, and the soluble particles on the tongue, are the principal causes, and these act"

He who examines the subject more deeply can see that man, as to each and every thing pertaining to him, is an organ of life, and that what produces sensation and perception flows in from without, and that the life itself is what causes man to feel and to perceive as if from himself. Another reason why life appears to be in man is that the Divine love is such that it desires its own to be man’s, and yet it teaches that it is not man’s. And the Lord wills that man should think and will and in consequence speak and act as if from himself, and yet should acknowledge that this is not done from himself. Otherwise man could not be reformed (see above, n. 971, 973). 1123. Verse 8.

Verse 8. For this reason in one day shall her plagues come, signifies that being such it is their last state, and then comes destruction.

Also from the signification of “in that day,” as being their last state, “day” signifying state, here the last, because it is added that then there is “death, mourning, and famine.” Also from the signification of “plagues,” as being such things as destroy spiritual life, thus destruction (see n. 584).

When this takes place the evil are cast into hell, and the good are drawn away from them and raised up into heaven; for as soon as the connection of anyone with heaven is broken he at once falls into hell. It is only the connection with heaven, thus with the Lord, that withholds from hell. (Continuation respecting the Athanasian Faith and respecting the Lord) [2] If it is said and thought that life itself is God, or that God is life itself, and with this there is no idea of what life is, then beyond these expressions there is no understanding of what God is. In the thought of man there are two ideas, one abstract, which is spiritual, and one not abstract, which is natural. The abstract idea, which is spiritual, about the life which is God is that it is love itself and that it is wisdom itself, and that love is of wisdom and that wisdom is of love. But the idea that is not abstract which is natural about the life which is God is that his love is like fire and his wisdom like light, and that together they are like a sunbeam. This natural idea is acquired from correspondence, for fire corresponds to love and light corresponds to wisdom, and therefore in the Word “fire” signifies love and “light” signifies wisdom. And when one preaches from the Word he also prays that heavenly fire (which means the Divine love) may warm all hearts, and that heavenly light (which means the Divine wisdom) may enlighten all minds. The Divine love, which in the Divine wisdom is the life itself which is God, is not in its essence thinkable, for it is infinite and thus transcends comprehension, but in its appearance it is thinkable. Before the eyes of angels the Lord appears as a sun, and from that sun proceed heat and light. The sun is the Divine love, the heat is the Divine love proceeding, which is called the Divine good, and the light is the Divine wisdom proceeding, which is called the Divine truth. And yet the life that is God must not be thought of as a fire or heat"

For God is a perfect man, in face like man and in body like man, with no difference as to form but only as to essence; his essence is that he is love itself and wisdom itself, thus life itself. 1125. Death and mourning and famine, signifies when there is no longer any good nor any truth, but only evil and falsity. This is evident from the signification of “death,” as being when there is no good, for then man is spiritually dead. (That “death” signifies in the Word spiritual death may be seen n. 78, 387, 694.) Also from the signification of “mourning,” as being when there is no longer any truth, thus when the church is desolated (see above, n. 1119). Also from the signification of “famine,” as being when there is nothing but evil and falsity, for “famine” signifies in the Word a lack of truth and good, and still a desire for them. Those who have such a lack and desire are meant by “those who hunger” and the “famished.” “Famine” signifies also a lack of truth and good when there is no desire for them, thus the loss of them. Such is the famine of those who are solely in falsities and evils (see above, n. 386a, b).

There is an inmost degree of life and there is an ultimate degree of life and there are intermediate degrees of life; the distinction between these is like the difference between things prior and things posterior, for a posterior degree exists from a prior one, and so on. Again, the difference is like the difference between things less and more general, for what is of a prior degree is less general, and what is of a posterior one is more general.

These degrees are called degrees of man’s life, but they are degrees of his wisdom and love, because they are opened according to the reception of wisdom and love, thus of life from the Lord. There are such degrees of life also in all the organs and viscera and members of the body, and by influx they act as one with the degrees of life in the brains. The skins, the cartilages, and the bones make their ultimate degree. [3] There are such degrees in man because there are such degrees in the life that proceeds from the Lord, but in the Lord these are life, while in man they are recipients of life. But it is to be known that in the Lord there are still higher degrees, and that all, both the highest and the lowest, are life; for the Lord teaches both that he is the life and that he has flesh and bones.

This is evident from the signification of “fire,” as being love in both senses, celestial love and diabolical love (see n. 68, 496, 504, 916), but here diabolical love, because it is the love of having dominion both over heaven and over the world. This is called diabolical love because it is from the deepest hells, where the devils are who desire to have dominion over all things of heaven, and who believe in their hearts that they are gods, and that there is no God besides them. Also from the signification of “to be burned up,” as meaning to perish by that love. To be burned up with fire is the penalty of profaning holy things by the love of having dominion over them, as may be seen above (n. 1083)."

This first, which has being [esse] in itself and from which all things have been created, is God, who is called Jehovah because he is being in himself. This, especially if it is illustrated by things created, reason can see. Now as there can be no being unless it exists, so being and existing [esse et existere] in God are one; for when there is being there is existing, and when there is existing there is being.

This is evident from the signification of “to weep and wail,” as being mourning and grief of heart (of which presently); also from the signification of “kings of the earth,” as being those who are in truths from good, and in the contrary sense who are in falsities from evil (see n. 29, 31, 625, 1034, 1063), here those who have exercised that authority and are therefore called “kings of the earth,” the “earth” meaning the church. It is evident from what follows that such are signified by “kings of the earth,” for it is said “who have committed whoredom and lived luxuriously with her,” which signifies who have been in falsities and evils from delight respecting that authority. Those who are in truths from good, who are also signified by “kings of the earth,” cannot “weep for her and wail over her.” [2] The expressions “to weep” and “to wail” are used, because “to weep” signifies mourning because of falsities, and “to wail” mourning because of evils, and because both have been lost; thus “to weep” has reference to the falsity that they have called truth, and “to wail” has reference to the evil that they have called good. This is why “mourning and wailing” are mentioned together in the Word. As in Jeremiah: O daughter of my people, make thee mourning for an only begotten, a wailing of bitterness, for the waster shall suddenly come upon us (Jer. 6:26). Here “mourning” is named because of truth destroyed, and wailing on account of good destroyed; the “waster” signifies the loss of these, and thus the end of the church.

Thus in the spring time, by the union of heat and light at that season the flying things of heaven and the animals of earth return into the love of prolification, and into a knowledge of all things pertaining to that love; and the things of the vegetable kingdom return into the efforts and activities of producing leaves, flowers and fruits, and seeds in them for perpetuating their kind to eternity, and for multiplying it to infinity.

Also from the signification of “living luxuriously,” as being to have delight from dominion or from that authority, thus to love evils. “To commit whoredom” is predicated of falsities, and “to live luxuriously” of evils, and both of delight in these. [2] As “committing whoredom” signifies the falsifying of truths, and “living luxuriously” signifies loving evils and thus also falsities, it shall now be told whence it is that the Babylonish nation has falsified the Word and weakened its Divine holiness. It has been known in the whole Christian world that the Word is Divine, and consequently that all things contained in the Word are Divine truths. Now as the Babylonians have claimed for themselves and have actually assumed dominion over all things of the church and also over heaven, and as they thus let themselves into all evils that spring up from the love of self, it was necessary for them to confirm those evils by means of the Word, and this could be done only by falsifying it, for the Word can in no wise confirm evil; consequently when a man confirms evil by means of the Word he falsifies its truths. This was done by the Babylonians; but as they still saw truths in the Word that they could not falsify, as for instance, all that is said in it about Babylon, so by their craft they weakened the Divine holiness of the Word, and forbade the reading of it by the people; and their leaders and presbyters, who are called monks, also refrained from reading it, saying that the decrees of the pope were just as holy as the contents of the Word, and that all things of the church must be adapted to its state, and consequently must be changed as its state requires, and that such adaptation and changes must be made from the inspiration of the pope. All this makes clear how it is that the truths of the Word have been falsified and rejected by them, and in place of these such things as pander to their love of ruling and wholly favor it, and which are in themselves falsities, have been accepted, and have been endorsed by their pope."

But an idea of anything without origin is impossible to the natural man; so, too, is the idea of God from eternity; but it is possible to the spiritual man. The thought of the natural man cannot be separated and abstracted from the idea of time; this idea clings to him from nature, in which he is. Nor can his thought be separated and abstracted from the idea of origin, since origin means to him a beginning in time. The appearance in the sun’s progression has impressed this idea on the natural man. But the thought of the spiritual man is abstracted from the idea of time, because it is raised above nature, and in place of that idea there is the idea of state of life, and in place of duration of time is an idea of the state of thought from affection, which constitutes life. For in the angelic heaven the sun does not rise or set or make years and days, as the sun in the world does; and for this reason the angels of heaven, because they are in spiritual ideas, think apart from time; consequently their idea of God from eternity does not take anything from origin, that is, from a beginning, but from state that it is eternal, and that everything therefore that is God and that proceeds from God is eternal, in other words, is Divine in itself. That this is so has been granted to perceive by an elevation above the natural idea into a spiritual idea. From all this it is now clear that God, who is uncreate, is also eternal, also that it is impossible to think that nature is from eternity, or that it is from itself in time; but it is possible to think that God is from eternity, and that nature with time is from God. 1131.

(That “smoke” signifies infernal falsity, may be seen n. 494, 539a, b, 889; and that “fire” signifies infernal evil, which is such as their love is, may be seen n. 68, 496, 504, 916.)

The natural idea of the eternal is from time, but the spiritual idea of it is not from time. And the natural idea of the infinite is from space, but the spiritual idea of it is not from space. For as life is not nature, so the two properties of nature, which are time and space, are not properties of life, for they were created with nature by the life which is God. The natural idea of the infinite God, which is from space, is that he fills the universe from end to end; but from this idea of the infinite there springs the thought that the inmost of nature is God, and thus that he is something extended, and yet everything extended belongs to matter. [3] As, therefore, the natural idea has nothing in common with the idea of life, of wisdom, and of love, which is God, so the infinite must be viewed from the spiritual idea, in which there is nothing of time and nothing of space, because there is in it nothing of nature. According to the spiritual idea the Divine love is infinite and the Divine wisdom is infinite, and since the Divine love and the Divine wisdom are the life which is God the Divine life is also"

As these excel all others in wisdom, they perceive that there is no ratio between their wisdom and the Lord’s Divine wisdom, because there is no ratio between the infinite and the finite. Moreover, they say that the first degree of wisdom is to see and acknowledge that this is so. The same is true of the Divine love. Furthermore, angels like men are recipient forms of life, thus they are recipients of wisdom and love from the Lord; and these forms are from substances that are without life, thus are in themselves dead, and between what is dead and what is living there is no ratio. [4] But how that finite receives the infinite can be illustrated by the light and heat of the sun of the world. The light itself and the heat itself from that sun are not material, and yet they affect material substances, the light by modifying them, and the heat by changing their states. The Lord’s Divine wisdom is likewise light, and the Lord’s Divine love is heat, but they are spiritual heat and light, because they proceed from the Lord as a sun, which is Divine love united to Divine wisdom; but the light and heat from the sun of the world are natural, because that sun is fire and not love. 1132.

The internals of man are the things that belong to his spirit, and are meant in the Word by “things near”; and therefore his externals, as being remote from internals, are meant by things “afar off,” and here by “standing afar off.” Moreover, every evil man when he is in externals is unlike what he is in internals. Not only does he then speak and act differently, he also thinks and wills differently, for his thought and will then are that he may appear as a civil, moral, and even as a spiritual man, and this either because of the law and its penalties or for the sake of reputation and consequent honor and gain, thus from fear of losing these. That the man is then “afar off” from himself is evident from the fact that when he returns from externals into his internals, as he does when alone, he thinks and wills in a wholly different way, and when he is with companions like himself he talks in a different way. This shows that “standing afar off” signifies in the spiritual sense to be in externals. [2] The chief reason why an evil man introduces himself or comes from internals into externals is fear; for fear closes up his internals when he sees the punishments and torments of his companions, and when his internals are closed up he comes into externals, and remains in them as long as the punishment is kept before his mind. And yet his internal is not made better by punishments, but remains wholly as before; therefore as soon as the fear of punishment recedes he returns into his evils, which are interiorly with him, and which belong to his spirit, and thus to his life. This may be illustrated by examples from the spiritual world. An evil spirit there is compelled by punishments not to speak or do evil; and in such a state he remains as long as he is in the place where the punishment is kept before his mind; but as soon as the fear of the punishment recedes he is evil as before. It is the same in the world. So long as thieves, robbers, and other criminals are in a city where all are held in restraint by the law and its penalties they do not steal or rob; but as soon as they come into forests, or into"

In Isaiah: Hear, ye that are afar off, what I have done, and ye that are near know my power (Isa. 33:13). “Those that are afar off” here mean the nations, because they are remote from internal truths, and “those that are near” mean those who are of the church and who are in truths from the Word. In the same: Bring my sons from afar, and my daughters from the end of the earth (Isa. 43:6).

[4] In the same: Listen, O isles, unto me, and ye peoples from afar. Lo, these shall come to thee from afar, and lo, these from the north and from the west (Isa. 49:1, 12). “Isles” and “peoples from afar,” and “from the north and from the west,” mean in like manner the nations with whom the church was to be established. The meaning is the same in Jeremiah: Declare it in the isles afar off (Jer. 31:10)."

That “near” means what is internal may be seen above (n. 16). (Continuation respecting the Athanasian Faith and respecting the Lord) [5] Since God is infinite he is also omnipotent, for omnipotence is infinite power. God’s omnipotence shines forth from the universe, which is the visible heaven and the habitable globe; these, with all things that are in the visible heavens and on the habitable globe, are the great works of the omnipotent creator. The creation of these and their maintenance testify that they are from the Divine omnipotence, while their order and mutual regard to ends from first to last testify that they are from the Divine wisdom.

By such opposition the affections are held in equilibrium as in the scales of a balance. [7] Such heavens and hells are innumerable, divided into assemblies and societies according to the genera and species of all affections; and these affections in their order and connection are in accord with the nearer and more remote affinities of the societies. This is true both of the heavens and of the hells. This order and this connection of affections are known to the Lord alone, and the arrangement of so many different affections, as many as there have been men from the first creation and will be hereafter, is a work of infinite wisdom, and at the same time of infinite power.

Everyone can see that a recipient of life cannot act at all from itself, and that its action must be from the life that is God. Nevertheless, it can act as if from itself, for this can be granted to it; that it has been granted to it has been said above. If man does not live from himself it follows that he does not think and will from himself, neither does he speak and act from himself, but from God who alone is life. That this is so appears as a paradox, for man has no other feeling than that these things are in himself, and thus are done by himself; and yet when he speaks from faith he acknowledges that everything good and true is from God, and that everything evil and false is from the devil, although everything that a man thinks, wills, speaks or acts, has reference to what is good and true or to what is evil and false. For this reason when a man does good he says within himself, or his teacher says to him, that he was led by God, and when he does evil that he was led by the devil. Also every man who preaches, prays that his thought, his discourse, and his tongue, may be led by the spirit of God, and sometimes he adds after preaching that he has spoken from the Spirit; and some even have a perception of this in themselves.

From the Lord’s Divine love, which appears in the angelic heaven as a sun, light and heat proceed. This light is the life of his Divine wisdom, and this heat is the life of his Divine love. This spiritual heat which is love, and this spiritual light which is wisdom flow into subjects that are recipient of life, as natural heat and natural light from the sun of the world flow into subjects not recipient of life. And although light simply modifies the substances into which it flows, and heat simply changes their state, yet it follows that if these were living subjects, they would feel these changes in themselves, and would suppose them to be from themselves; and yet they recede with the sun and return with the sun. It is because the life of the Lord’s Divine wisdom is light that the Lord in many passages of the Word is called light, and it is said in John: The Word was with God, and God was the Word. In him was life, and the life was the light of men (John 1:1–4.) From all this it is now clear that God has infinite power because he is the all in all.

But it is from a law of the Divine providence that man should know no otherwise, since without such a feeling and such a perception he cannot receive anything to himself, appropriate anything to himself, or bring forth anything from himself; thus he would be neither a recipient of life from the Lord nor an agent of life from the Lord, but would be like an automaton, or like an upright image, without understanding or will, with the hands hanging down, awaiting influx that could not be given. For if life were not received and not appropriated as if by man, it would not be retained, but would flow through, and in consequence man from being alive would become like one dead, and from being a rational soul would become not rational, thus either a brute or a stock; for he would have no delight of life, that is, the delight that everyone has from receiving as if from himself, from appropriating and from bringing forth as if from himself, since delight and life act as one, and when you take away all the delight of life you grow cold and die. [5] If it were not according to a law of the Divine providence that man should feel and perceive as if life and everything pertaining to it were in him, and should be left to acknowledge simply that good and truth are not from him but are from the Lord, nothing could be imputed to man, neither good nor truth, and thus neither love nor faith; and if nothing could be imputed, the Lord would not have commanded in the Word that man must do good and shun evil, and if he did good heaven would be his inheritance, and if he did evil hell would be his portion; nor even would there be any heaven or hell, for without that perception man would not be a man, thus would not be a dwelling place of the Lord. For the Lord wills to be loved by man as if by him; thus it is that the Lord dwells with man in what is his own, and this he has given him in order that he may be loved reciprocally; for the Divine love consists in this, that it wishes what is its own to be man’s, and this could not be unless man felt and perceived what is from the Lord to be as if it were his own.

The end from which he acts is his love, which is his life, and the end for the sake of which he acts is the delight of his love or life, and the effect in which the end presents itself is use. The end for the sake of which he acts, which is the delight of his life’s love, is felt and perceived in man, because the end from which he acts enables him to feel and perceive it; and that end is, as has been said, the love which is life. But to the man who acknowledges that all things of his life are from the Lord, the Lord gives the delight and blessedness of his love, so far as the man acknowledges this and performs uses. Thus when man by acknowledgment and by faith from love, as if from himself, ascribes to the Lord all things of his life, the Lord in turn ascribes to man the good of his life, which carries with it every happiness and every blessedness, and also enables him to feel and perceive interiorly and exquisitely this good to be in himself as if it were his own, and the more exquisitely in proportion as man from the heart wills that which he acknowledges by faith. The perception is then reciprocal, for the perception that he is in man and man is in him is grateful to the Lord, and the perception that he is in the Lord and the Lord in him is gratifying to man. Such is the union of the Lord with man and of man with the Lord by means of love. 1139. Because no one buyeth their merchandise anymore signifies that the falsities and evils by which they make gain are no more received. This is evident from the signification of “merchandise,” as being the falsities and evils of doctrine and of that religion, by which they make gain, which consists in honors and riches. (That this is the signification of “merchandise” is evident from the signification of “merchants,” as being those who acquire and sell such things, see above n. 1138.) What falsities and evils in particular are here signified by “merchandise” will be seen in what follows, where they are enumerated. This “merchandise,” since it belongs to Babylon, which is called a “harlot” and “the mother of the whoredoms of the earth,” is what is meant in the Word by “the merchandise of whoredoms”; and that this means the falsifications and adulterations of good and truth may be seen above (n. 695)."

(Continuation respecting the Athanasian Faith and respecting the Lord) [2] Man has a feeling and perception that life is in him, because the life of the Lord is in him as the light and heat of the sun are in a subject. This light and heat belong not to the subject but to the sun in the subject, for they withdraw with the sun, but when they are in the subject they in appearance wholly belong to it; from light the subject has color as if it were in it, and from heat it has vegetative life as if it were in it. But this is much more true of the light and heat from the sun of the spiritual world, which is the Lord, whose light is the light of life and whose heat is the heat of life, for the sun from which these proceed is the Lord’s Divine love, while man is the recipient subject. This light and heat never withdraw from the recipient, which is man, and when they are in man they are in appearance wholly his own. From the light he has the ability to understand, and from the heat the ability to will. From this, that the light and heat, although they are not his own, are seemingly wholly in the recipient, and from this that they never withdraw, also from this that they affect his inmosts, which are remote from the sight of his understanding and from the feeling of his will, there must needs be the appearance that they are innate, that is, they seem to be in him, and thus what they effect seems to be from him. From this it is that man does not know otherwise than that he thinks from himself and that he wills from himself; and yet he does not in the least do this from himself, for it is impossible for this light and heat to be so united to the recipient as to be his own, precisely as it is impossible for the light of the sun to"

Of precious stone and of pearl signifies the knowledges of truth and good from the Word that have been profaned. This is evident from the signification of “precious stone,” as being the knowledges of truth from the Word (see n. 717); also from the signification of “pearl,” as being the knowledges of good (see n. 1044); and as such knowledges are factual truths [vera scientifica] or truths of the natural man, so “precious stones” signify the truths through which goods come, and “pearls” the goods through which truths come, for everywhere in the Word there is a marriage of truth and good, and for the reason that truth is not truth unless it looks to good or proceeds from good, and good is not good unless it looks to truths or exists through truths. Thus truths and goods are joined as in a marriage, and truths and goods exist as from a marriage.

Of all such from the creation of the world hell consists. All these are called either devils or satans; those in whom the love of self has predominated are called devils, and those in whom the love of the world has predominated are called satans. The hell where devils are is meant in the Word by the “devil,” and the hell where satans are is meant by “satan.” Moreover, the Lord has so joined the devils together that they are as one, and also the satans; and this is why the hells are called the devil and satan in the singular. Hell does not consist of spirits immediately created, neither does heaven consist of angels immediately created; but hell consists of men born in the world, who were made devils or satans by themselves, and in like manner heaven consists of men born in the world, who were there made angels by the Lord. All men as to the interiors which belong to their minds are spirits, clothed in the world with a material body which is under the direction of the thought of the spirit and under the control of its affection; for the mind which is spirit acts, and the body which is matter is acted upon; and every spirit after the material body has been cast off, is a man similar in form as a man in the world (see above, n. 1127).

Truths and goods from a celestial origin are profaned by their transferring to themselves the Lord’s Divine power of saving the human race, thus transferring their love to the Lord to the pope as a vicar and to his ministers. And yet the Lord cannot be loved when he has no power to save; but the man is loved who is put in the Lord’s place. They say that the Lord is loved because he has given that power to a man, and that he is loved and is held in holy respect by those who have received that power, and is worshipped by the rest. But love to the Lord cannot exist with them, because the love of having dominion over heaven and over the church is wholly contrary to it; for such love is love of self, which is a diabolical love, from which the Lord cannot be loved. Such love regarded in itself is rather hatred against the Lord, and it is turned into hatred when they become spirits and dominion is taken away from them. Then they persecute all who are in love to the Lord. All this makes clear how they profane truths and goods which are from a celestial origin. [2] That “fine linen” signifies truths from a celestial origin can be seen from the following passages. In Ezekiel: I clothed thee with embroidered work, I shod thee with the skin of the badger, and I girded thee with fine linen, and covered thee with silk. Thus wast thou adorned with gold and silver, and thy garments were fine linen, and silk, and embroidered work (Ezek. 16:10, 13). This is said of Jerusalem, which means the church, here in its first establishment. “Embroidered work and the skin of the badger” here signify the knowledges of truth and good from the Word; “fine linen and silk” signify truths from a celestial origin and truths from a spiritual origin. These are said to be “garments,” because “garments” signify the truths with which good is clothed. In the same: Fine linen in embroidered work was thy spreading forth, and purple from the isles of Elishah was thy covering (Ezek. 27:7).

The “rich man” means the Jewish nation, which is said to be “clothed in purple and fine linen,” because they have the Word from which they might have goods and truths; goods are here meant by “purple,” and truths by “fine linen,” both from a celestial origin. “Lazarus lying at the rich man’s porch” means the Gentiles that did not have the Word.

The armies of him that sat upon the white horse followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean (Rev. 19:14). “Fine linen” signifies truth from a celestial origin because fine linen was a kind of very shining flax of which garments were made;"

(Continuation respecting the Athanasian Faith) [4] The hell where those are who are called devils is the love of self; and the hell where those are who are called satans is the love of the world. The diabolical hell is the love of self because that love is the opposite of celestial love which is love to the Lord; and the satanic hell is the love of the world because that love is the opposite of spiritual love, which is love towards the neighbor. Now as the two loves of hell are opposites of the two loves of heaven, hell and the heavens are in opposition to each other; for all who are in the heavens look to the Lord and to the neighbor, but all who are in the hells look to self and the world. All who are in the heavens love the Lord and the neighbor, and all who are in the hells love self and the world, and consequently hate the Lord and the neighbor. All who are in the heavens think what is true and will what is good, because they think and will from the Lord; but all who are in the hells think what is false and will what is evil, because they think and will from self. From this it is that all who are in the hells appear turned backward, with the face turned away from the Lord; they also appear turned upside down, with the feet upwards and the head downwards.

Their heat from that fire is like a boiling up from impurities, which is lust, and their light from that fire is only an appearance of light from fantasies and from confirmations of evil by falsities, but still it is not light, for when the light of heaven flows in it becomes to them thick darkness, and when the heat of heaven flows in it becomes to them cold; nevertheless, they see from their light, and live from their heat; but they see like owls, birds of night, and bats, whose eyes are"

It is from that power that they live to eternity. Their dead principle is from the evils and falsities that spring from their loves. Consequently their life viewed from their loves is not life but death; and this is why in the Word hell is called “death,” and those who are there are called “the dead.” 1144. And of silk and of scarlet signifies truths and goods from a spiritual origin that have been profaned. This is evident from the signification of “silk,” as being truth from a spiritual origin (of which presently); also from the signification of “scarlet,” as being good from a spiritual origin (see above, n. 1142). This good coincides with truth from a celestial origin, and therefore that, too, is signified by “scarlet” in the Word. But “silk and scarlet” here signify such truths and goods profaned by Babylon, which are profaned when spiritual love, which is love towards the neighbor, has been perverted; for those who are in such love of self as the Babylonians are in, can have no love to the neighbor; if they love others it is for the sake of self, so that the end is the man himself and love to the neighbor the means, and the end loves the means so far as the means are serviceable to it; and casts them away when they cease to serve it. This can be seen in all the particulars of their works. Love towards the neighbor in the spiritual sense is the love of uses; and when uses are for the sake of self, it is not a love of uses but a love of self. That “silk” signifies truth from a spiritual origin, can be seen from the passage in Ezekiel (16:10, 13) which has been explained just above (n. 1143). “Silk” signifies truth from a spiritual origin because of its gloss, for silk is glossy from light, and “light” signifies the Divine truth, which is also called the spiritual Divine."

Man was created to love self and the world, to love the neighbor and heaven, and to love the Lord. For this reason when a man is born he first loves himself and the world, and afterwards, so far as he becomes wise, he loves the neighbor and heaven, and as he becomes still wiser he loves the Lord. Such a man is in the Divine order, and is actually led by the Lord, although apparently by himself. But so far as he is not wise he stops in the first degree, which is to love himself and the world; and if he loves the neighbor, heaven, and the Lord, it is for the sake of self before the world. But if he is wholly unwise he loves himself alone, and the world and also the neighbor for the sake of self; while heaven and the Lord he either despises or denies or hates in heart, if not in words. These are the origins of the love of self and of the love of the world, and as these loves are hell, it is evident whence hell is. [3] When a man has become a hell, he is like a tree cut off or like a tree whose fruits are malignant; or he is like sandy soil in which no seed will take root, or like soil, out of which springs nothing but the thorn that pricks or the nettle that stings. When a man becomes a hell the inner or higher parts of his mind are closed up and the outer and lower are opened. And as the love of self determines all things of the thought and will to itself and immerses them in the body, it inverts and twists back the outer parts of the mind, which, as has been said, are open, and as a consequence these incline and bend and are borne downwards, that is, towards hell. [4] But since man has still an ability to think, to will, to speak and to do, and this ability is in no case taken away from him, because he was born a man, so having become inverted and no longer receiving any good or any truth from heaven, but only evil and falsity from hell, he acquires a kind of light by confirmations of evil from falsity, and of falsity from evil in order that he may be eminent above others. This he believes to be a rational light, when yet it is an infernal light, and in itself fatuous, producing vision like that of a dream in the night, or a delirious fantasy, by reason of"

This is evident from the signification of “wood,” as being the good of the natural man (of which presently); but “thyine wood” signifies good conjoined to truth in the natural man, for the word thyine in the Greek is derived from the word that means two; and “two” signifies such conjunction. That “thyine wood” signifies good conjoined to truth is evident also from what precedes and from what follows; from what precedes the things that signify celestial goods and truths and the things that signify spiritual goods and truths are enumerated, which are “fine linen, purple, silk, and scarlet”; and from what follows, the things that signify natural goods and truths are enumerated, which are “vessel of ivory, and vessel of precious wood, of brass, iron, and marble.” This makes clear that “thyine wood” signifies good conjoined to truth in the natural man, arising from those goods and truths that are mentioned above. For there are three degrees of life in man, which viewed in their order are called celestial, spiritual, and natural; in this verse such things as signify goods and truths according to their degrees are mentioned in this order. But as the things mentioned above signify truths and goods profaned, which in themselves are falsities and evils, so good conjoined to truth, which is “thyine wood,” means such good profaned, which is evil conjoined to falsity. And because such good is of the natural man, it is especially profaned by venerations of bones and sepulchers, by sanctifications of many things used in worship, by many things relating to processions, and in general by all things idolatrous that are delightful to the natural man, and are consequently felt to be good and are called true. [2] “Wood” signifies good, because it is from a tree from which are fruits; also because wood can be burned and be useful in keeping the body warm, and in building houses and making various articles of convenience and use; also because an oil, which signifies the good of love, may be expressed from wood; it also contains in it that which gives heat. “Stone” on the other hand"

For the same reason the angels of the third heaven dwell in houses of wood, and this because they are in the good of love to the Lord, to which “wood” corresponds. Moreover, their different kinds of wood have a correspondence according to the trees from which they are; for a tree signifies man, and its fruit the good of man. This is why woods from various kinds of trees are mentioned in the Word, as the olive, the vine, the cedar, the poplar, the oak; and the wood of the olive signifies celestial good, of the vine spiritual good, of the cedar rational good, of the poplar natural good, and of the oak sensual good. [3] Now as all things in the world are correspondences, and wood corresponds to good, and in the contrary sense to evil, so “wood” here signifies good, and in the contrary sense evil, as can be seen from the following passages.

The lack of the knowledges of truth and good is thus described; the lack of the knowledges of truth by “drinking waters for silver,” and the lack of the knowledges of good by “wood coming at a price.” In Ezekiel: They shall pillage thy riches, and make a prey of thy merchandise; they shall break down thy walls, and overthrow the houses of thy desire; thy stones, thy woods, and thy dust shall they place in the midst of the sea (Ezek. 26:12). This describes the devastation of all things of truth and good of the church by evils and falsities. The “riches” which they pillage are the knowledges of truth; the “merchandise” of which they shall make a prey are the knowledges of good; the “walls” which they shall break down are doctrinals; “the houses of desire” which they shall"

This represents the conjunction of the celestial and spiritual kingdoms of the Lord by the good of love. “Judah and the sons of Israel his companions” signify the Lord’s celestial kingdom; “Judah” that kingdom as to good, and “the sons of Israel his companions” as to truth; but “Joseph and the tribes of Israel his companions” signify the Lord’s spiritual kingdom, “Joseph” that kingdom as to good, and the “tribes of Israel his companions” as to truth. “Ephraim” signifies the understanding of truth; and as those who are in the understanding of truth from spiritual good are in the Lord’s spiritual kingdom, the stick is called Ephraim’s. That the Lord conjoins these two kingdoms into one by the good of love to him and by the good of charity towards the neighbor is meant by the Lord’s “joining them one with the other into one stick, that the two may be one in the hand of Jehovah, and be made one stick.” That things derived from falsities are corrected by means of good was represented and signified by: The bitter waters in Marah were made sweet by the wood cast into them (Exod. 15:25). “Bitter waters” mean the things that are apparently true but are derived from falsities; “wood” means the good of the natural man. Because “wood” from correspondence signifies the good of love, the tables of stone on which the law was inscribed were placed in an ark made of shittim wood; and for the same reason other things"

This is signified by: Serving wood and stone (Deut. 4:23–28; Isaiah 37:19; Jer. 3:9; Ezek. 20:32; and other places). In Isaiah: He chooseth wood that will not rot, he seeketh for himself a wise artificer to prepare a graven image that shall not be moved (Isa. 40:20). “Wood” here signifies evil which is adored as good, for a “graven image” means the evil of worship; “to choose wood that will not rot” signifies some good from the Word that is becoming adulterated and thus evil; this is chosen because that which is from the Word persuades, and thus does not perish in the mind, which is the case with evil and falsity confirmed by the Word. “He seeks a wise artificer” signifies to seek one who from self intelligence has a gift for confirming and falsifying.

In Moses: If one should kill his companion by error, as in coming with a companion into a forest, and the axe slip from the wood upon his companion, he shall flee to a city of refuge (Deut. 19:5). That one who sins by error is permitted to flee to a city of refuge is here illustrated by an example that rarely happens, but it is cited to show what is meant by slaying by error; this example is cited because wood and axe and forest are significative, “wood” being good, “axe” falsity, and “forest” the natural man; therefore these words signify that if one who is in natural good should bring destruction upon another’s soul by falsity which he does not know to be falsity, it would be done by error, because it is not done from evil. [8] In Habakkuk: The stone crieth out of the wall, and the beam from the wood answereth (Hab. 2:11). This means that evil confirms and incites falsity; the “wall out of which the stone crieth” signifies man devoid of truths, and thus wishing to be taught falsity; “the beam that answereth from the wood” signifies man destitute of good, “wood” signifying the evil that confirms falsity and agrees with it. In Jeremiah: Saying to the wood, thou art my father, and to the stone, thou hast begotten me; for they have turned the neck to me and not the face (Jer. 2:27). “Saying to the wood, thou art my father,” signifies to be conceived from evil; and “saying to the stone, thou hast begotten me,” signifies to be born from falsity of evil; “to turn the neck and not"

[9] As “swords” signify falsities destroying truths, and “woods” signify evils destroying good, so by command of the chief priests: A multitude went out with Judas Iscariot against Jesus, with swords and staves (Matt. 26:47; Mark 14:43, 48; Luke 22:52). This was done because all things relating to the Lord’s passion were representative of the destruction by the Jews of all things of good and truth. With the sons of Israel there were two general punishments, stoning and hanging upon wood, stoning for injuring or destroying truth, and hanging upon wood for injuring or destroying good. For this reason: Hanging upon wood was a curse (Deut. 21:22–23). All this makes clear that “wood” signifies good, specifically the good of the natural man, and in the contrary sense its evil.

This is why in the Word “vessels” signify cognitions and so far as these belong to the natural man, and are laid up in the memory of that man, they are knowledges.

This truth is signified by “ivory,” as well as by “ebony.” In Ezekiel: Of the oaks of Bashan have they made thine oars; they have made thy benches of ivory. Many isles were the traffic of thine hand, they brought thee for a gift horns of ivory and ebony (Ezek. 27:6, 15). This is said of Tyre, which signifies the knowledges of truth, by which man has intelligence. These knowledges are here described by a ship, the oars of which were of oak and the bench of ivory, “oars” signifying the things of the understanding that are of use in speaking and that belong to the sensual man, and “bench” signifying that part of the understanding by which one is led, which is the rational. This is here signified also by the “ebony” which the isles bring, “isles” signifying those in the church who are natural and yet rational.

As “house” signifies man as to those things that are of his mind, they formerly built houses of ivory, as we read of Ahab (1 Kings 22:39), which signified man as to the rational. This makes clear what is signified by these words in David: Out of the ivory palaces have they made thee glad (Ps. 45:8). This is said of the Lord. “Ivory palaces” mean truths from the rational man, thus rational truths. But “vessel of ivory” and “vessel of precious wood” signify rational truths and goods profaned, because they were predicated of Babylon, which signifies profanation of all things of truth and good.

It is the same with the sensory of hearing. This perceives sounds, whether words or musical tones, from the place from which they come as if it were there; when in fact, the sounds flow in from without and are perceived by the understanding within the ear. It is the same with the sensory of smell; this, too, perceives from within what flows in from without, sometimes from a great distance. Also the sensory of taste is excited by the foods that come in contact with the tongue from without. The sensory of touch does not feel unless it is touched. These five bodily sensories by virtue of an influx from within are sensible of what flows in from without; the influx from within is from the spiritual world, and the influx from without is from the natural world. [5] With all this the laws inscribed on the nature of all things are in harmony, which laws are: (1) That nothing exists or subsists from itself, or is acted upon or moved by itself, but only by something else. From this it follows that everything exists and subsists and is acted upon and moved by the first that is not from another, but is in itself the living force, which is life. (2) That nothing can be acted upon or moved unless it is intermediate between two forces, one of which acts and the other reacts, that is, unless one acts on the one side and the other on the other, and unless one acts from within and the other from without. (3) And since these two forces when at rest produce an equilibrium, it follows that nothing can be put in action or moved unless it is in equilibrium, and when put in action it is out of the equilibrium; also that everything put in action or moved seeks to return to an equilibrium. (4) That all activities are changes of state and variations of form, and that the latter are from the former. By state in man his love is meant, and by changes of state the affections of love; by form in man his intelligence is meant, and by variations of form his thoughts; and thoughts are from affections. 1147.

But as what is here presented relates to the natural man, it is to be known that the natural of man is threefold—rational, natural, and sensual; the rational is the highest in it, the sensual is the lowest, and the natural is the middle. The genuine rational is from influx from the spiritual world, the sensual is from influx from the natural world, and the mediate natural is either of the rational or of the sensual. That the natural is threefold can be seen in men who while they are in the world are either rational or sensual or intermediate. Which of these they are is clear especially from their perception of civil, moral and spiritual laws. Those are rational who think, judge, and conclude well from reason, and the thoughts of such are raised above material things; but those who are sensual think from material things and in them, and what they speak from thought is only from the memory. As there are these two degrees, there is also an intermediate degree which is called the natural. What men are can be known also from their understanding of the Word. The rational draw from the sense of the letter such things as pertain to doctrine, while the sensual abide in the letter only and draw from it nothing more interior. The same distinctions exist in the spiritual world, since in the lowest heaven there are the same degrees of natural men; the lowest there are the sensual, and the highest the rational; but of these more will be said elsewhere.

Some angels of the lowest heaven, who did not comprehend that evil and falsity are from hell, because they had believed in the world that they were themselves in evils from birth and from actual life, were led through infernal societies from one to another, and in each one while they were in it they thought just as the devils there thought, and differently in the several societies, thinking in opposition to goods and truths. They were told to think from themselves, and thus otherwise, but they said that they were wholly unable to do so. In this way they were made to comprehend that evils and falsities flow in from hell. It is the same with many who believe and insist that they have life in themselves. Also it sometimes occurs that angels are separated from the societies with which they are connected, and when thus separated they are unable to think, will, speak, or act, but lie like newborn infants; but as soon as they are restored to their societies they revive. For everyone, man, spirit or angel, is connected as to his affections and thoughts therefrom with societies, and acts as one of them; and for this reason it is known what each one is from the society in which he is. All this makes clear that the quality of each one’s life flows in from without. [3] With regard to myself I can testify that for fifteen years I have clearly perceived that I have thought nothing and willed nothing of myself; also that every evil and falsity has flowed in from infernal societies, and that every good and truth has flowed in from the Lord. Some spirits reflecting upon this declared that I had no life. It was permitted me to reply, I am more alive than you are, since I feel the influx of good and truth from the Lord and see and perceive the enlightenment. I also perceive from the Lord that evils and falsities are from hell, and not only that this is so, but also from what spirits they come; and it has been granted me to speak with these, to rebuke them, and to reject them with their evils and falsities, and thus I was delivered from them. Furthermore, it was granted me to say that now I know that I live, and before I did not know it. From all this I have been fully convinced that every evil and falsity is from hell, and every good and truth, together with the perception of them, is from the Lord; and moreover, that I have freedom and thus perception as if from myself."

It shall be told briefly how evil and falsity have power to flow forth from hell, when there exists only one acting force, which is the life that is God; this also has been revealed. There was uttered with a loud voice out of heaven a truth from the Word, which flowed down to hell and through it to its lowest part; and it was heard that this truth in its flowing down was successively and by degrees turned into falsity, and at length into such falsity as is wholly opposite to the truth; then it was in the lowest hell. It was so changed because everything is received according to the state and form; so truth flowing into inverted forms, such as are in hell, became successively inverted and changed into the falsity opposite to the truth. From this it is clear what hell is from top to bottom, also that there is but one acting force, which is the life that is the Lord. 1148. And of marble signifies sensual truth that has been profaned. This is evident from the signification of “marble,” as being the sensual, which is the ultimate of the life of man’s thought and will.

That ultimate truth, which is called sensual, has also been profaned is evident from the adoration of the sepulchers, bones, and carcasses of those who are called saints, although they are putrid and correspond to things infernal. The very senses of the body would turn away from such things if the holy things of the church had not been profaned to such an extent.

It is from that ability and that freedom that he is able to receive both good and evil as if of himself.

When man knows this, and it is granted him by the Lord to think, will, speak, and do this as if from himself, and this continually by influx, then if he does not receive he becomes guilty.

When he does these two things he does not appropriate evil to himself, and does not claim merit for the good. But I know that there are many who do not comprehend this, and who have no desire to comprehend it, but let them pray, “That the Lord may be with them continually, that he may lift up and turn his face to them, that he may teach, enlighten, and lead them, since of themselves they can do nothing that is good, that he may grant to them to live; that the devil may not lead them astray and instill evils into their hearts, knowing that if they are not led by the Lord the devil will lead them and breathe into them evils of every kind, as hatred, revenge, cunning, and deceit, as a serpent instills poison; for the devil is present stirring up and continually accusing, and wheresoever he meets with a heart turned away from God, he enters in, dwells there, and draws the soul down to hell.

This is evident from the signification of “cinnamon,” as being the good of celestial love (of which presently); also from the signification of “incense or perfume,” as being the truth of celestial love, which truth is the good of wisdom because it is from the good of celestial love. Worship from celestial love is meant because in this verse things relating to worship are enumerated, while in the former verse the things relating to doctrine were enumerated. That things relating to worship are here signified can be seen from what follows, and also from this, that so many particulars are enumerated, which would not have been done except to describe the profanation of all things of worship from first to last. There is this distinction between doctrine and worship, that doctrine teaches how God must be worshiped, and how man must live that he may withdraw from hell and draw near to heaven; but this is effected by worship, since worship is actual as well as oral. [2] “Cinnamon” signifies celestial love because it is a most excellent aromatic, and for this reason the oil for holy anointing was prepared from this and other aromatics (as may be seen Exod. 30:23, 24); and the oil for holy anointing signified the Divine love, and the aromatics, which were pure myrrh, aromatic cinnamon, sweet calamus, and cassia, signified the Divine wisdom, and when united with the oil of olive signified the Lord’s Divine wisdom united to his Divine love. The Divine wisdom was signified by those aromatics, because “odor” signifies perception, and perception belongs to wisdom.

And because this truth derives its essence from the good of celestial love it is called the good of wisdom. That the worship from that love has been profaned is evident from what has been said above about the profanation of all things of doctrine; and when all things of doctrine have been profaned all things of worship are also profaned, since worship is from doctrine and according to doctrine. (Continuation respecting the Athanasian Faith) [3] (4) The fourth law of the Divine providence is that the understanding and will must not be compelled in the least, since all compulsion by another takes away freedom, but man should compel himself—for to compel oneself is from freedom. Man’s freedom belongs to his will, and from the will it is in the thought of the understanding, and through the thought in the speech of the lips and in the action of the body. For when a man wills anything from freedom he says, I will to think this, I will to speak this, and I will to do this. Moreover, from the freedom of the will man has the ability to think, to speak, and to act; for the will gives this ability, because it gives freedom. Since freedom belongs to man’s will it also belongs to his love, since nothing constitutes freedom in man except the love that is of his will; and for this reason that love is man’s life; for man is such as his love is; consequently whatever goes forth from the love of his will goes forth from his life. This makes clear that freedom belongs to man’s will, to his love, and to his life, consequently that it makes one with what is his own [proprium] and with his nature and disposition. [4] Now because it is the Lord’s will that everything that comes from himself to man should be appropriated to man as if it were his own, since otherwise there would be in man no reciprocal by which conjunction is effected, so it is a law of the Divine providence that man’s understanding and will should not be compelled in the least by another.

Moreover, internals belong to man’s spirit, and externals to his body, and as it is the spirit of man that must be reformed the spirit is not compelled. [5] Nevertheless, there are fears that compel man’s internals or his spirit, but they are only such fears as flow in from the spiritual world, and which relate on the one hand to the punishments of hell, and on the other to the loss of favor with God. But fear on account of the punishments of hell is an external fear of the thought and will, while the fear of the loss of favor with God is an internal fear of the thought and will, and is the holy fear that adds and conjoins itself to the love, with which at length it makes one essence.

This is evident from the signification of “ointment,” as being the good of spiritual love (of which presently); also from the signification of “frankincense,” as being the truth of spiritual good (see n. 491). “Ointment and frankincense” signify spiritual love because the incense offerings were made with these; and the incense offerings signified spiritual love because of the fragrant smoke that went up from the holy fire in the censers. Spiritual love is love towards the neighbor, which makes one with the love of uses. There are two loves of heaven, and thus of the church, from which the Lord is worshipped; celestial love, which is love to the Lord, and spiritual love, which is love towards the neighbor; the former is signified by “cinnamon and perfumes,” the other by “ointment and frankincense.” Moreover, all worship is from love; the worship that is not from one or the other of these loves is no worship, but only an external act in which there is inwardly nothing of the church.

And thou shalt make it an incense; an ointment, the work of the perfumer, salted, pure, holy; and thou shalt beat some of it very small, and put it before the testimony in the tent of meeting where I shall meet with thee; it shall be unto you the holy of holies (Exod. 30:34–37). Here all these things are called “the ointment of the perfumer.” (The particulars are explained in Arcana Coelestia n. 10289– 10308.) (Continuation respecting the Athanasian Faith) [2] There is infernal freedom and there is heavenly freedom. Infernal freedom is that into which man is born from his parents, and heavenly freedom is that into which man is reformed by the Lord. From infernal freedom man has the will of evil, the love of evil, and the life of evil; while from heavenly freedom he has the will of good, the love of good, and the life of good; for as has been said before, a man’s will, love and life, make one with his freedom. These two kinds of freedom are opposites of each other, but the opposition is not evident except so far as man is in one and not in the other. But a man cannot come out of infernal freedom into heavenly freedom unless he compels himself. To compel oneself is to resist evil and to fight against it as if from oneself, but still to implore the Lord for help. Thus a man fights from the freedom that is inwardly in him from the Lord against the freedom that is outwardly in him from hell. While he is in the combat it seems to him that it is not freedom from which he fights, but a kind of compulsion, because it is against that freedom into which he was born; and yet it is freedom, since otherwise he would not fight as if of himself.

When a man has compelled himself to act in opposition to infernal freedom he sees and perceives that infernal freedom is servitude and that heavenly freedom is freedom itself, because it is from the Lord. The essence of the matter is this, that so far as a man compels himself by resisting evils, so far the infernal societies with which he acts as one are removed from him, and he is introduced by the Lord into heavenly societies, with which he acts as one. On the other hand, if a man does not compel himself to resist evils he remains in them. That this is so I have learned through much experience in the spiritual world, and further, that evil does not withdraw in consequence of any compulsion that comes from punishments, or from fear of them afterwards. 1152. And wine and oil signifies profaned worship from truths and goods that are from a celestial origin. This is evident from the signification of “wine,” as being truth (of which presently); also from the signification of “oil,” as being good from a celestial origin (see n. 375). “Wine” signifies truth from a celestial origin because it is here joined with “oil” which means good from that origin. For in this verse, as in the former, there are pairs, of which one signifies what belongs to truth, and the other what belongs to good, both from the same origin; and from this it follows that “wine” signifies truth from a celestial origin, because “oil” signifies good from that origin. That “wine” in the Word signifies truth or spiritual good may be seen above (n. 376); for truth from a celestial origin coincides with spiritual good. It is the same with oil; when the oil of holy anointing is meant, “oil” signifies the good of celestial love, but when the oil with which they anointed themselves on festal days is meant, it signifies the good of spiritual love."

For when a man compels himself to good and has not compelled himself from evil he does good from himself and not from the Lord, for he compels himself to it for the sake of self, or for the sake of the world, or for the sake of recompense, or from fear; and such good is not in itself good, because the man himself or the world or recompense is in it as its end, and not the good itself, thus neither the Lord; and it is love and not fear that makes good to be good. For example, to compel oneself to do good to one’s neighbor, to give to the poor, to endow churches, to do what is righteous, thus to compel oneself to charity and truth before compelling oneself from evils and thereby removing them, would be like a palliative treatment by which the disease or ulcer is healed externally; or like an adulterer compelling himself to act chastely, or a proud man to act humbly, or a dishonest man to act honestly in external conduct. [3] But when a man compels himself from evils he purifies his internal, and when that is purified he does good from freedom without compelling himself to do it; for so far as a man compels himself from evil so far he comes into heavenly freedom, and everything good that is in itself good is from that freedom, and to such good man does not compel himself. The appearance is that compelling oneself from evil and compelling oneself to good necessarily go together, but they do not. I know from the evidence of experience of many who have compelled themselves to do goods, but not from evils; and when such were explored it was found that evils from within clung to the goods, and in consequence their goods were like idols or images made of clay or dung; and it was said that such persons believe that God may be gained over by praise and gifts, even from an impure heart.

And fine flour and wheat signifies profaned worship from truths and goods that are from a spiritual origin. This is evident from the signification of “fine flour,” as being truth from a spiritual origin (of which presently); also from the signification of “wheat,” as being good from a spiritual origin (see n. 374a, d; 375a, b). These also signify worship because the meal offering was composed of them, which was offered with the sacrifices upon the altar the same as the wine and the oil; for the meal offerings were prepared with oil and the drink offerings with wine. And because of the crops of these they had rejoicings in festivals which were instituted to celebrate their harvests. “Fine flour” signifies truth from spiritual good because it is prepared from wheat, which signifies spiritual good, as truth comes from good. [2] As this truth of the church was signified by “fine flour,” it was prescribed what quantity of it should be used in the cakes that were called the meal offerings, which were offered with the sacrifices upon the altar (respecting which see Exod. 29; Lev. 5–7, 23; Num. 18, 28–29); also the quantity of fine flour in the show bread (Lev. 23:17; 24:5); for it was commanded that the meal offering that was to be offered on the altar should be prepared from fine flour, and oil and frankincense poured thereon (Lev. 2:1). Because of this signification of “fine flour,” when Abraham talked with the three angels he said to Sarah his wife: Hasten, knead three measures of flour, of fine flour, and make cakes (Gen. 18:6). [3] “Fine flour” also signifies the truth of good from a spiritual origin in Ezekiel: Thou didst eat fine flour, honey, and oil, whence thou didst become exceeding beautiful, and didst prosper even to a kingdom. My bread which I gave thee, fine flour, honey, and oil, with which I fed thee, thou didst offer before idols as an odor of rest (Ezek. 16:13, 19)."

Thus in Isaiah: Take the millstone and grind flour, make thyself bare (Isa. 47:2). This is said of Babylon. “To take a millstone and grind flour” signifies to falsify the truths of the Word, and “to make oneself bare” signifies to adulterate the goods of the Word.

[6] Man does not perceive the operation of the Divine providence within him, because that would take away his freedom, and thus his ability to think as if of himself, and with it every delight of life; thus man would be like an automaton, in which there is no reciprocal, and by that, conjunction; also he would be a slave and not free. The Divine providence moves so secretly that scarcely a trace of it is seen, although it acts upon the most minute things of man’s thought and will, which regard his eternal state, chiefly for the reason that the Lord continually wills to impress his love on man, and through it his wisdom, and thus create him into his image. Consequently the operation of the Lord is into man’s love and from that into his understanding, and not the reverse. Love with its affections, which are manifold and innumerable, is perceived by man only by a most general feeling, and thus so slightly that there is scarcely anything of it; and yet that man may be reformed and saved he must be led from one affection of love into another according to their connection from order, a thing that no man and even no angel can at all comprehend. [7] If a man should learn anything of these arcana, he could not be withheld from leading himself; and in this he would be continually led from heaven into hell, while the Lord’s leading is continually from hell towards heaven.

It is sufficient for man to know truths, and by means of truths to know what is good and what is evil, and to acknowledge the Lord and his Divine auspices in every least thing. Then so far as he knows truths, and by means of them what is good and evil, and does what is good as if from himself, so far the Lord leads him from love into wisdom, conjoining love to wisdom and wisdom to love, and making them to be one, because they are one in himself. These ways by which the Lord leads man may be compared to the vessels through which the blood in man courses and circulates, also the fibers and their foldings within and without the viscera of the body, especially in the brain, through which the animal spirit flows and gives life.

In these passages sheep signify those who are in the good of charity, therefore in an abstract sense, “sheep” signify the goods of charity. But “beasts of burden” signify the truths that look to the goods of charity, and as asses are especially meant, and these were used for riding and carrying burdens, things pertaining to use and to instruction were signified. As in Isaiah: They carry their wealth upon the shoulder of beasts of burden (Isa. 30:6). Wealth here signifies knowledges. And in Luke: The Samaritan set the man wounded by the robbers on his own beast of burden (Luke 10:34). “To set him on his own beast of burden” signifies to instruct him according to his ability (see n. 375e, 376e, 444c), where this is explained. What “beasts of burden” signify when asses are meant may be seen (n. 31b, 140). It is said that “beasts of burden and sheep” signify truths and goods from a spiritual-natural origin, because such goods and truths are meant as are in those who are in the Lord’s external church, and thus in the first or lowest heaven. These are natural, and yet they receive the spiritual, and are therefore called spiritual-natural. But here, as elsewhere, profaned worship from such truths and goods is meant.

Again, it is like a man about to build a house, who provides himself with the necessary materials, as timber, rafters, stones, mortar, and other things. But afterwards the Lord builds the house from foundation to roof exactly adapted to the man, though the man does not know it. From this it follows, that unless a man provides the necessary things for a garden or a house, he will have no garden with the benefit of its fruits, and no house and thence no habitation. [3] So it is with reformation. The things that man must provide himself with are the knowledges of truth and good from the Word, from the doctrine of the church, from the world, and by his own labor. The Lord does everything else while man is ignorant of it.

For “horses” signify intellectual things, “chariot” doctrine, “covered carriages” doctrinals of good, “mules” things rational, and “swift beasts” things rational as to good; “the brethren” whom they will bring signify all who are in the good of charity, and “Jerusalem the mountain of holiness” signifies the church in which charity reigns.

It is therefore a holy law of the Divine providence that internal freedom should in no way be violated; for by that freedom the Lord enters into man, even into the hell where he is, and by it leads him while in hell, and if he is willing to follow, leads him out of hell and leads him into heaven, and nearer and nearer to himself in heaven.

These evils are removed by the Lord by means of the affection of truth inspired in man from which he has intelligence, and by means of the affection of good through which he has love. So far as a man is in these affections, so far he compels himself to resist evils and falsities. And this way of reformation is closed by miracles and visions, for they persuade and compel belief, and thus send the thoughts bound as it were to prison; and when freedom has thus been taken away there can be no ability from the interior to remove evils, for nothing of evil is removed except from the interior.

A man who is sold is also called “soul” in Moses: If anyone hath stolen a soul of his brethren, and hath made gain of him by selling him, he shall be killed (Deut. 24:7). A “slave” signifies truth known, because the knowledges of the natural man wait upon and serve the rational man in thinking, and this is why knowledges are signified in the Word by ministries, household servants, services, and slaves, and here by “souls of men.” Here as above is meant worship from truths and goods profaned by Babylon."

They are also like: The rich man in hell who said to Abraham that his brethren would repent if one from the dead were sent to them; to whom Abraham replied, They have Moses and the prophets, let them hear them; if they hear not Moses and the prophets neither will they be persuaded if one rose from the dead (Luke 16:29, 31). And they are like: Thomas, who said he would not believe unless he saw; to whom the Lord said, Blessed are those who believe and do not see (John 20:25, 29). “Those who believe and do not see” are those who do not desire signs, but truths from the Word, that is, Moses and the prophets, and who believe them. Such are internal men and become spiritual; but the former are external and remain sensual, and when they see miracles, and believe only because of the miracles, in their belief are not unlike a lovely woman who within is infected with a deadly disease of which she soon dies, or they are like an apple with a fair skin but rotten at the core, or like filberts in which a worm lies concealed. Moreover, it is known that no one can be compelled to love or to believe, and that love and faith must be inwardly rooted in man. Consequently it is not possible for anyone to be led to love God and to believe in him by means of miracles and visions, because these compel. For when one does not believe from the miracles in the Word, how can he believe from miracles that are not in the Word? 1157. Verse 14.

Verse 14. And the fruits of the desire of thy soul have departed from thee, signifies that the gladnesses and joys they expected from worship and life according to the traditions of the Babylonish nation are turned into weeping and mourning. This is evident from the signification of “the fruits of the desire of the soul,” as being the gladnesses and joys they hoped for from worship and life according to the traditions of the Babylonish religion. This is the signification of these words, because the things enumerated in verses 12 and 13 signify all things of the doctrine and worship of that religious persuasion from which those who believe in a life after death expect gladnesses and joys; therefore these are “the fruits of the desire of their souls.” Also from the signification of “have departed from thee,” as being that these have been dissipated, and have been turned into weeping and mourning, because into the torments of hell. Those gladnesses and joys which they expect are merely external, thus corporeal and worldly, for such do not know what internal gladnesses and joys are, because they have no truths from the Word, thus no truths from the Lord, but only from him whom they call his vicar, from whom falsities can come forth but no truths, because they have dominion for their end. Therefore that the people may be kept under the yoke of that dominion, such things from self and the world as delight the body are offered them.

The permission of evil is from this cause. To every man of sound reason the Lord can give the affection of truth and faith therefrom and the affection of good and love therefrom by withholding him from evil loves, which belong to his own; for so far as man is withheld from these he is in the understanding of truth and in the will of good. I have seen the very devils brought back to such a state; and while they were in it they talked about truths from understanding and faith, and did good from will and love. They were brought into this state because they had denied that they were unable to understand truths and do good. But as soon as withholding from their own loves had relaxed, and they had returned into the lusts of their loves, in place of faith in truth they had faith in falsity, and in place of love of good they had love of evil. This has often been witnessed, and in the presence of many. From this it is clear that everyone is capable of being reformed, and that being reformed is nothing else than being removed from evil loves. How man is removed from those loves has been told above. The Lord does not thus withhold man from evils for the reason that those who come into the affection of truth and thence into faith, and into the affection of good and thence into love, and do not continue in these affections to the end of life, but fall back into the loves from which they had abstained, profane holy things. [3] There are many kinds of profanation, but this kind is the most grievous of all. The lot of such after death is terrible. They are not in hell but beneath hell; and there they neither think nor will, but merely see and act. They see things that are not, and do not see the things that are. They act as if they were doing everything, and yet they do nothing. They are nothing but deliriums of fantasy. And as they neither think nor will, they are no longer men, for the human is thinking and willing.

By their reformation a communication is established between them and heaven, whereby goods and truths flow in; and by these the interiors of their minds are opened, and evils are removed to the sides. If they remain in this state till death they are happy, but if they do not they become unhappy, for the evils that have been removed then flow back and mingle themselves with the truths and goods; thus hell is so mixed with heaven in them that the two cannot be separated; for if anything has once been impressed on the mind of man by love it can never be rooted out; since, therefore, after death the goods cannot be separated from the evils nor the truths from the falsities, the mind is wholly overthrown, and such spirits no longer have any thought or will, but what remains is like a shell when the kernel is removed, or like the skin with the skeleton when the flesh is gone, for this is all that is left of the man.

This is evident from the signification of “fat things,” as being what is good and thus satisfying (of which presently); also from the signification of “splendid things,” as being what is true and thus grand. This is the signification of “splendid things,” because splendor is from light, and the light of heaven is the Divine truth or the Divine wisdom, from which all things in the heavens shine with a splendor such as does not exist in the world; it may be compared with the splendor of a diamond turned to the sun, although the splendor seen in heaven exceeds this beyond measure, as the light of heaven exceeds the light of the world, with a difference so great that while it may be illustrated by comparisons it cannot be described. From that light all things magnificent in the heavens exist, which consist principally of forms corresponding to wisdom, which are such as can in no way be pictured in the world, and consequently cannot be described, for in them art itself is in its art, and knowledge in its"

[2] “Fat things” signify what is good and thus satisfying, because the fat is the best part of flesh and because it resembles oil, which signifies the good of love. That “fatness” signifies good and things pertaining to good, thus satisfactions and joys, can be seen from the following passages in the Word. In Isaiah: In hearkening hearken unto me, and eat ye that which is good, that your soul may be delighted in fatness (Isa. 55:2). “To eat that which is good” signifies to appropriate good to oneself; therefore “to be delighted in fatness” signifies to be in a state of satisfaction and blessedness. In Jeremiah: I will fill the soul of the priests with fatness, and my people shall be satisfied with good (Jer. 31:14). Here, too, “fatness” signifies satisfaction and blessedness from the good of love. In David: With fat and fatness my soul shall be satisfied, and my mouth will praise thee with lips of songs (Ps. 63:5). “To have the soul satisfied with fat and fatness” signifies to be filled with the good of love and consequent joy; “to praise with lips of songs” signifies to worship by truths that gladden the mind. In the same: They shall be filled with the fatness of thy house, and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures (Ps. 36:8). The “fatness” with which the house shall be filled signifies the good of love and consequent satisfaction, “house” being the things of the mind; “the river of pleasures” that he will make them to drink of signifies intelligence and consequent happiness."

This is said of the state of those who will acknowledge and worship the Lord. That “mountain” signifies a new church from these, “a feast of fat things, of fat things of marrows,” signifies both natural and spiritual good with joy of heart, and “lees, and lees well refined” signify truths from that good with happiness from them. In the same: Jehovah shall give the rain of thy seed with which thou shalt sow the land, and bread of the produce of the land, and it shall be fat and plenteous (Isa. 30:23). “Rain of seed” signifies the multiplication of truth, and “bread of produce” signifies fructification of good; “fat and plenteous” signifies good and truth with all satisfaction and happiness. In David: They shall still have increase in old age, they shall be fat and green, to proclaim that Jehovah is upright (Ps. 92:14–15). “To be fat and green” signifies to be in the goods and truths of doctrine. In the same: Jehovah shall remember all thy offerings and shall make fat thy burnt offering (Ps. 20:3). “Offerings and burnt offering” signify worship, and to “make fat” signifies worship from the good of love. “Fatness” has the same signification in Ezek. 34:3; Gen. 27:39; and elsewhere. As “fat and fatness” signified the good of love, and all worship which is truly worship must be from the good of love, therefore: It was appointed that all the fat and fatness in the sacrifices should be burnt on the altar (Exod. 29:13, 22; Lev. 1:8; 3:3–16; 4:8–35; 7:3–4, 30–31; 17:6; Num. 18:17–18)."

[4] As the Jewish and Israelitish nation was only in external worship, and not also in internal worship, and in consequence was in no good of love and in no good of charity and faith: It was forbidden them to eat the fat and blood, and it was declared that they would be cut off if they should eat them (Lev. 3:17; 7:23, 25). But to those who are in internal worship and from that in external worship, such as those must be who will be of the Lord’s new church, it is said: That they shall eat fat till they be full, and drink blood till they be drunken (Ezek. 39:19); “fat” here signifying all the good of heaven and of the church, and “blood” all their truth. In the contrary sense those who are “fat” signify those who are nauseated at good, or who at least despise and reject it (Deut. 32:15; Jer. 5:28; 50:11; Ps. 17:10; 20:4; 68:31; 119:70; and elsewhere).

From this it can be seen why it is according to a law of order relating to reformation, which is called a law of Divine providence, that man is not let into the truths of faith and the goods of love except so far as he can be withheld from evils and held in goods even to the end of life, and that it is better for a man to be permanently evil than that he be good and afterwards evil, for thus he becomes profane. It is for this reason that the Lord, who provides all things and foresees all things, hides the operations of his providence, even to the extent that man scarcely knows whether there be any providence"

The Lord also permits like things by other laws of his providence, namely, by these, that man should have freedom, and that he should do whatever he does according to reason, thus wholly as if of himself, for it is better for a man to ascribe the workings of the Divine providence to prudence and fortune than to acknowledge them and still live as a devil.

Thus would it have been with the Jews (Matt. 12:45); and this is why they were forbidden to eat fat and blood (Lev. 3:17; 7:23, 25), for this signified their profanation of what is holy in consequence of their being such. Moreover, the Lord by his Divine providence guards with the greatest care against this kind of profanation; and lest this exist, he separates the holy things with man from those that are not holy, and stores up the holy things in the interiors of his mind, and raises them up to himself; while the things not holy he stores up in the exteriors, and turns them to the world. Thus holy things can be separated from the unholy, and thus man can be saved. But this cannot be done when goods and evils are mixed together.

Verse 15. The merchants of these things who became rich by her signifies all those who gained from that religious persuasion honor and wealth, and thus the good things of opulence and eminence, which are satisfying and grand.

Also from the signification of “becoming rich,” as being to gain such things and to make gain by them. The good things of eminence and opulence which are signified by “things fat and splendid” are here meant, and these are external things that are satisfying and grand separated from internal things, thus the goods of the world separated from the goods of heaven; for those who are of Babylon do not know what internal satisfactions are, because they do not read the Word and look to the Lord, but they know only what external satisfactions are, and with these only are they delighted. They are not receptive of internal satisfactions. The answers of those who were invited to the great supper have a similar signification: One of whom said that he had bought a field, to which he must go, another that he had bought oxen which he must prove, and a third that he had married a wife (Luke 14:18–20). All these things mean the goods of the world, or external goods withdrawn from internal goods. There is a like signification in the Lord’s words in Matthew: That they were eating and drinking, contracting matrimony and giving in nuptials, and knew not until the flood came and took them all away (Matt. 24:38–39)."

All this makes clear that all the kinds of merchandise enumerated in this chapter mean external goods and satisfactions that are not at the same time internal, and thus that those who are in these are meant by “the merchants who became rich” by these means. (Continuation) [2] (8) The eighth law of the Divine providence is that the Lord is continually withdrawing man from evils so far as man is willing from freedom to be withdrawn; that so far as man can be withdrawn from evils the Lord leads him to good and thus to heaven; but so far as man cannot be withdrawn from evils the Lord cannot lead him to good and thus to heaven; for so far as man has been withdrawn from evils so far he does good from the Lord, and that good is good in itself; but so far as he has not been withdrawn from evils, so far he does good from himself, and that good has evil within it. By the speech of his lips and the actions of his body man is in the natural world; but by the thoughts of his understanding and the affections of his will he is in the spiritual world. By the spiritual world heaven and hell are meant, both divided into innumerable societies, according to all the varieties of affections and consequent thoughts arranged in a most complete order. In the midst of these societies is man, so bound to them as not to have the least ability to think or will except in connection with them, and so connected that if he were to be torn away from them or they from him he would fall down dead, life remaining only in his inmost, whereby he is a man and not a beast, and whereby he lives to eternity. Man does not know that in regard to his life he is in such inseparable fellowship. This he does not know, because he has no discourse with spirits. For so long a time has man known nothing about that state; but lest this should remain hidden to eternity, it has been revealed. This much must be said before this law of the Divine providence can be understood."

(Continuation) Man is from birth in the midst of infernal societies, and extends himself into them precisely as he extends the evil affections of his will. All evil affections of the will are from the loves of self and the world; and for the reason that those loves turn all things of the mind downwards and outwards, that is, towards hell, which is beneath and outside of themselves, thus turning them away from the Lord, and away from heaven. Moreover, the interiors of all things of the human mind, and with them the interiors of all things of the spirit, are capable of being turned either downwards or upwards. They are turned downwards when man loves himself above all things; and they are turned upwards when he loves the Lord above all things. This is an actual turning. Man from himself turns them downwards, while the Lord from himself turns them upwards. The ruling love is what turns. Thoughts do not turn the interiors of the mind except so far as they are derived from the will. That all this is true man does not know; and yet he ought to know it in order that he may understand how he is led out of hell and led into heaven by the Lord. 1164. Weeping and mourning signifies grief of soul and heart. This is evident from the signification of “weeping,” as being grief of soul, and from the signification of “mourning,” as being grief of heart. Grief of soul and grief of heart differ as truth and good differ, for in the Word “soul” is predicated of truth, which is of faith, and “heart” of good, which is of love; so the expression occurs in the Word, “from the soul and heart.” They differ also as will and understanding in man differ, and also as the respiration of the lungs and the motion of the heart differ. And as there is in the Word a marriage like the marriage of truth and good, or of faith and love, or of understanding and will, so it is here with “weeping and mourning,” that is, “weeping” is from grief of soul, and “mourning” from grief of heart."

If he does not resist as if from himself, he remains in hell and hell in him, nor is he separated from it to eternity. This follows from the laws of the Divine providence that are stated above and that have been explained. Moreover, experience will teach that this is true. Evils are removed from man either by punishments, or by temptations, and consequent turning away, or by the affections of truth and good. With those not reformed evils are removed by punishments; with those about to be reformed they are removed by temptations and consequent turning away; and with the regenerate by the affections of truth and good. The experience is this: when an unreformed or evil person endures punishments, as takes place in hell, he is kept in the punishments until it is perceived that of himself he does not will the evils; not until then is he set free. Thus is he compelled of himself to put away evils. If he is not punished even to that intention and will he continues in his evil. Yet even then the evil is not rooted out, because he has not compelled himself. The evil remains within, and returns when the fear ceases. With those about to be reformed evils are removed by temptations, which are not punishments but combats. Such persons are not compelled to resist evils, but they compel themselves and pray to the Lord, and thus are delivered from the evils which they have resisted. Such afterwards refrain from evils, not from any fear of punishment but from an aversion to evil; and at length this aversion to evil is their resistance. But with the regenerate there are no temptations or combats, but the affections of truth and good that keep evils far away from them; for they are wholly separated from hell, which is the source of evils, and are conjoined to the Lord. [3] To be separated and removed from evils is the same thing as to be separated and removed from infernal societies. The Lord has the power to separate and remove from infernal societies, that is, from evils, and the power to transfer to heavenly societies, that is, to goods, anyone he may wish; but such a change can continue"

The quality of all who come from the earth into the spiritual world is known from their ability or inability to resist evils as if from themselves. Those who are able to do this are saved, while those who are not able are not saved. The reason is that man is not able to resist evils from himself, but only from the Lord; for it is the Lord who resists evils in man and gives man to feel and perceive as if he does it from himself. Therefore those in the world who have acknowledged the Lord, and have acknowl edged that all good and truth are from him, and that nothing is from man, and thus that power over evils is from the Lord, and not from themselves, such resist evils as if from themselves. But those who have not acknowledged this in the world are unable to resist evils as if from themselves, for such are in evils and in the delight of evils from love; and to resist the delight of love is the same as resisting themselves, their own nature, and their own life. An experiment was made whether such were able to resist evils when the punishments of hell were described to them, and even when those punishments were seen and were felt; but it was in vain; for they hardened their minds, saying, Let this be so, and let it come, but so long as I am here let me be in the pleasures and joys of my heart.

It is a work of Divine omnipotence, because to resist one evil is to resist many, and even to resist the hells. For every evil is joined with innumerable other evils, and they cling together like the hells with each other; for as evils make one so do the hells, and as the hells make one so do evils, and no one but the Lord is able to resist the hells so united. It is a work of Divine omniscience, because the Lord alone knows what man is and what his evils are, and what their connection is with other evils, thus in what order they must be removed that man may be inwardly or radically cured. It is a work of Divine providence, that nothing may be done contrary to the laws of order, and that what is done may promote man’s eternal good; for Divine omnipotence, Divine omniscience,"

[3] All this makes clear that no angel is able to resist the evils with man, but the Lord only. The Lord carries on this work in man both immediately from himself, and mediately through heaven, and yet in such a way that no angel knows anything about it. For heaven in the whole complex is the Lord, because it is his Divine proceeding; consequently when he is working through heaven he is working from himself. It is said mediately because the Divine operation flows through the heavens, and yet it takes nothing from the own [proprium] of any angel there, but only from what is its own with them. The appearance is the same as when a man does any act; to produce it he moves innumerable motor fibers scattered through his whole body, but of this action no single fiber knows anything. Such are angels in the Divine body which is called heaven. 1167.

(Continuation) The law of the Divine providence, that so far as a man can be withdrawn from evils he does good from the Lord that is good in itself, but so far as he cannot be withdrawn from evils, he does good from himself, and such good has evil in it, may be illustrated by the commandments of the Decalogue. Take for example the commandment not to steal. Those who resist as if from themselves the lust of stealing and thus the lust of gaining wealth dishonestly and unjustly, saying in their hearts that this must not be done because it is contrary to the Divine law, thus contrary to God, and is in itself infernal, thus in itself evil, such after some brief combats are withdrawn from that evil, and are led by the Lord into the good that is called integrity, and into the good that is called justice; and then they begin to think about these goods, and to look upon them"

Such goods are from the Lord, because they are goods that are good in themselves. It is otherwise when the lust of gaining wealth dishonestly and unjustly remains with man; then he cannot act honestly from honesty or justly from justice, thus not from the Lord, but only from self. For he acts honestly and justly only that he may be believed to be honest and just with a view to securing greater gain and honor; these ends are in his goods, and from the end is the whole quality of the good. Such good has evil in it, since its quality is from the end to make gains dishonestly and unjustly. Everyone can see that such good cannot become good in itself until the evil has been removed. It is the same with all the other commandments of the Decalogue. 1168. [English version, ver. 17.] For in one hour were devastated so great riches signifies the loss of all that they had gained, and of all things by which they hoped to make gains. This is evident from the signification of “were devastated in one hour,” as being total destruction (see n. 1136), and so the loss of all things; also from the signification of “riches,” as being gains, which are honors and wealth, thus things they have gained, also the evils and falsities of their doctrine and religious persuasion, which are the things by which they hoped to make gains. “Riches” have the same signification as the “merchandise” enumerated in verses 12–14. (Continuation) [2] So far as man is removed from evils he is removed from hell, for evils and hell are one; and so far as he is removed from these he enters into goods and is conjoined with heaven, for goods and heaven are one. Man thus becomes another man; his freedom, his good, his mind, and his understanding and will, are turned about, for he becomes an angel of heaven. His freedom, which before had been a freedom to think and will evil, becomes a freedom to think and will good, which in itself is essential freedom. Until a man is in this freedom he does not know what freedom is, for from the"

The good that man had before done, since it was from the freedom of evil, could not be good in itself, for it had in it the love of self or of the world. Good can have no other origin than love; therefore such as the love is such is the good; yet even when the love is evil its delight is felt as good, although it is evil. But after this change the good that man does is good in itself, because it is from the Lord who is good itself, as has been said above. [3] The mind of man, before it was conjoined to heaven was turned backwards, because it had not been led out of hell. When it is in a state of reformation, it looks from truth to good, thus from left to right, which is contrary to order. But when the mind has been conjoined to heaven it is turned forwards and lifted up to the Lord and looks from right to left, that is, from good to truth, which is according to order. Thus a turning is brought about. It is the same with the understanding and will, since the understanding is a recipient of truth, and the will a recipient of good. Before man has been led out of hell the understanding and will do not act as one; for man then sees and acknowledges from the understanding many things that he does not will, because he does not love them. But when man has been conjoined to heaven the understanding and will act as one, for the understanding then becomes the will’s understanding; for when the turning has been effected whatever a man wills he loves, and whatever he wills from love he thinks. Thus when a man has been removed from evils by resistance and combat against them as if from himself, he comes into the love of truth and good; and then everything that he wills and consequently does he also thinks and consequently speaks. 1169. Verse 17. And every pilot, and all that are employed on ships, and sailors, and as many as work at sea, stood afar off. 17. “And every pilot, and all that are employed on ships, and sailors, and as many as work at sea,” signifies all that have believed themselves to be in wisdom, in intelligence, and in knowledge, and have confirmed the falsities of that doctrine and religious persuasion by reasonings"

And every pilot, and all that are employed on ships, and sailors, and as many as work at sea, signifies all that have believed themselves to be in wisdom, intelligence, and knowledge, and have confirmed the falsities of that doctrine and religious persuasion by reasonings from the natural man. This is evident from the signification of “ships” as being the knowledges of truth and good, also doctrinals in both senses (see n. 514); and as wisdom, intelligence and knowledge are from the knowledges of truth and good, so a “pilot or ship master” signifies those who are in wisdom. “Those employed on ships” signify those who are in intelligence; and “sailors” signify those who are in knowledge. Wisdom, intelligence, and knowledge are mentioned, because they follow in that order with those who from knowledges become wise. Wisdom is in the third degree, intelligence in the second, and knowledge in the first or ultimate, and this is why they are mentioned in that order in the Word, as in Moses: I have filled Bezaleel with the spirit of God, in wisdom, in intelligence, and in knowledge (Exod. 31:3; 35:31). The above is evident also from the signification of “working at sea,” as being to confirm by reasonings from the natural man, and here to confirm the falsities of that doctrine and religious persuasion, for “the sea” signifies the natural man, and “working” there signifies to reason, and by reasonings to confirm. Strictly, “to work at sea” signifies to acquire the things by which they may make gain, also to sell such things, and thus to make gain. But as gains were described above by “merchants and their merchandise,” here “working at sea” has another signification, namely, to confirm by reasonings. That “pilots or ship masters” signify those who are wise can be seen in Ezekiel: The wise men of Zidon and Arvad were thy pilots. The elders of Gebal and the wise men thereof were thy caulkers (Ezek. 27:8, 9). But these things may be seen explained above (n. 514a)."

      "text": "APOCALYPSE EXPLAINED 3568 (Continuation) [2] There are two faculties of life in man, one called the understanding and the other the will. These faculties are entirely distinct from each other; but they were created to make one, and when they make one they are called one mind; but with man they are at first divided, and afterwards united. They are distinct just as light and heat are. For the understanding is from the light of heaven which in its essence is the Divine truth or the Divine wisdom; and while man is in the world the understanding in him sees, thinks, reasons, and concludes from that light. Yet man is ignorant of this fact, since he knows nothing about that light or its origin. The will is from the heat of heaven, which in its essence is the Divine good or the Divine love; and while man is in the world the will in him loves from that heat, and has from it all its pleasure and delight. Of this fact also man is ignorant, since he knows nothing about that heat or its origin. Since, then, the understanding sees from the light of heaven, it is evidently the subject and receptacle of that light, and thus the subject and receptacle of truth and of wisdom therefrom. And since the will loves from the heat of heaven, it is evidently the subject and receptacle of that heat, and thus the subject and receptacle of good, that is, of love. From all this it can be clearly seen that these two faculties of man’s life are distinct, as light and heat are, also as truth and good are, and as wisdom and love are. [3] That these two faculties are at first divided in man, is plainly perceptible from the fact that man is capable of understanding truth, and good from truth, and of accepting it as good, even though he does not will it and from willing do it; for he understands what is true and thus what is good when he hears and reads about it, and understands so fully as to be able afterwards to teach it by preaching and writing. But when alone and thinking from his spirit he can apprehend that he does not will the truth, and even that he wills to act contrary to it, and does act contrary to it when not restrained by fears. Such are those who are able to speak intelligently, and yet live otherwise. This is “seeing one law in"

This division between the understanding and the will is perceived especially by those who wish to be reformed, and but little by others. [4] This division is possible because the understanding with man has not been destroyed, but the will has been destroyed. For the understanding is comparatively like the light of the world by which man is able to see with equal clearness in the winter season and summer season; while the will is comparatively like the heat of the world, which may be absent from the light or be present in the light. It is absent in the winter season and present in the summer season. But the fact is this, that nothing except the will destroys the understanding, as nothing except the absence of heat destroys the germinations of the earth. The understanding is destroyed by the will in those who are in evils of life when the two act as one, and not when they do not act as one. They act as one when man thinks by himself from his love, but they do not act as one when he is with others. When he is with others he conceals and thus sets aside his will’s own love; and when this is set aside the understanding is raised up into higher light. [5] This shall be shown by experience. I have occasionally heard spirits talking with one another and also with myself so wisely that an angel could scarcely have talked more wisely; and I was in consequence led to believe that they would soon be raised up into heaven; but after a while I saw them with the evil in hell, at which I wondered. But I was then permitted to hear them talking in a wholly different way, not in favor of truths as before, but against them, because they were now in the love of their own will and likewise of their own understanding, while before they were not in that love. It has also been granted me to see how what is man’s own is distinguished from what is not his own; for this may be seen in the light of heaven. What is man’s own has its seat within, and what is not his own has its seat without; and the latter veils and conceals the former, and the former does not appear until this veil is taken away, as takes place with all after death.

All this makes clear that these two faculties of life in man are at first divided. [6] Something shall now be said about their union. They are united in those who are reformed, which is effected by combat against the evils of the will. When these evils have been removed the will of good acts as one with the understanding of truth. From this it follows that such as the will is such is the understanding, or, what is the same, such as the love is such is the wisdom. The wisdom is such as the love is because the love belonging to the will is the esse of man’s life, and the wisdom belonging to the understanding is the existere of life therefrom; therefore the love, which belongs to the will, forms itself in the understanding, and the form it there takes on is what is called wisdom; for as love and wisdom have one essence it is clear that wisdom is the form of love, or love in form. When these faculties have thus been united by reformation the will’s love increases daily, and it increases by spiritual nourishment in the understanding; for it has there its affection for truth and good, which is like an appetite that hungers and desires. From all this it is clear that it is the will that must be reformed, and as it is reformed the understanding sees, that is, grows wise; for as has been said, the will has been destroyed, but the understanding has not. The will and the understanding also make one with those who are not reformed, that is, in the evil, if not in the world yet after death; for after death man is not permitted to think from his understanding except in accordance with the love of his will. To this everyone is finally brought; and when he is brought to this condition the evil love of the will has its own form in the understanding, and as this form is from the falsities of evil it is insanity. 1171. Stood afar off signifies not now in these things as before because of fear.

(Continuation) Let the following be added to what has been said. (1) Before reformation the light of the understanding is like the light of the moon, clear according to the knowledges of truth and good; but after reformation it is like the light of the sun, clear according to the application of the knowledges of truth and good to the uses of life. (2) The reason that the understanding has not been destroyed is that man may know truths, and from truths see the evils of his will, and seeing them he may resist them as if from himself, and thus be reformed. (3) And yet man is not reformed from his understanding, but by means of the recognition of truths by the understanding and its seeing evils by them; for the operation of the Lord’s Divine providence is into the love of man’s will, and from that into the understanding, and not the reverse. (4) The love of the will gives intelligence according to its quality. Natural love from spiritual love gives intelligence in civil and moral matters; but spiritual love in natural love gives intelligence in spiritual matters; but merely natural love and the conceit that comes from it does not give intelligence in spiritual matters, but gives the ability to confirm whatever it pleases, and after confirmation so infatuates the understanding that it sees falsity as truth, and evil as good. Nevertheless, this love does not take away the ability to understand truths in their light; when it is present it takes it away, but not when it is absent. (5) When the will has been reformed, and the wisdom belonging to the understanding has come to be of the love belonging to the will, that is, when wisdom comes to be the love of truth and good in its form, man is like a garden in spring time, when heat is united to light and gives a soul to the germinations. Spiritual germinations are such productions of wisdom from love; and in every such production there is a soul from that love, while its clothing is from wisdom; thus the will is like a father and the understanding like a mother. (6) Such is man’s life, not only the life of his mind, but also the life of his body, since the life of the"

Man does not know that this is so; nevertheless it is for this reason that an evil person cannot live in heaven, or a good person in hell. For either of these becomes as it were dead when he is not among those with whom the life of his will and thus the life of his understanding acts as one.

From all this it is clear that “they cried out as they saw the smoke of her burning,” signifies grief of mind when they saw the punishment on account of the direful falsities that flowed from their loves. (Continuation) [2] (9) The ninth law of the Divine providence is that the Lord does not teach man truths either from himself or through the angels immediately; but he teaches mediately by means of the Word, preaching, reading, conversation, and communication with others, and thus by thoughts within oneself about these things. Man is thus enlightened in the measure of his affection of truth from use. Otherwise man could not act as if from himself. This follows as a consequence from the laws of the Divine providence before explained, namely, that man must be in freedom, and must do what he does from reason; that he must think as if from himself from his understanding, and must do good as if from himself from his will; also that he must not be compelled to believe anything or do anything by miracles or by visions. These laws are unchangeable, because they are laws of the Divine wisdom and also of the Divine love; and yet they would be disturbed if man should be taught immediately, either by influx or by speech. [3] Moreover, the Lord flows into the interiors of man’s mind and through these into its exteriors, also into the affection of his will and through that into the thought of his understanding, but not the reverse. To flow into the interiors of man’s mind and through these into its exteriors is to take root and from the root produce; for the root is in the interiors and production in the exteriors; and to flow into the affection of the will and through that into the thought of the understanding is first to inspire a soul, and through that to form all other things; for the affection of the will is like a soul whereby the thoughts of the understanding are formed.

About what flows into the interiors of his mind, or about what flows into the affection of his will, man knows nothing; but he would know about that which flowed into the exteriors of his mind, or into the thought of his understanding, and this would be to produce something without a root, or to form something without a soul. Everyone can see that this would be contrary to Divine order, consequently that it would be to destroy and not to build up. By all this the truth of this law of the Divine providence is made clear. 1174. Saying, What is like this great city, signifies astonishment that that doctrine and religious persuasion were destroyed. This is evident from the signification of “great city,” which is Babylon, as being its doctrine and religious persuasion; for “city” signifies doctrine, and “Babylon” its religious persuasion (as above, n. 1134); astonishment that they were destroyed is signified by their “crying out and saying, What is like it,” and this follows from seeing the smoke of her burning. (Continuation) [2] But how the Lord flows in and man is thus led can be known from no other source than the spiritual world, where man is as to his spirit, that is, as to his affections and the thoughts therefrom, for these constitute man’s spirit; and the spirit from its affection, and not the body, is what thinks. The affections of man, from which are his thoughts, have extension into societies in the spiritual world on every side, into more or fewer of them according to the amount and quality of the affection. Man as to his spirit is within these societies, and to them he is attached as it were with extended cords, which determine the space where he can walk. As he passes from one affection into another, so he passes from one society into another, and the society he is in, and the place where he is in the society, is the center from which the affection and its thought extends to other societies as circumferences, and these are thus in unbroken connection with the affection at the center, and from that affection man then thinks and speaks."

If his affection is evil he is conveyed through infernal societies; and if he does not look to the Lord he is carried into these societies more interiorly and deeply. And yet the Lord leads him as if by the hand, permitting and withholding as far as man is willing to follow in freedom. But if man looks to the Lord he is led forth from these societies gradually, according to the order and connection in which they stand, which order and connection no one knows but the Lord only, and thus he is brought by continual steps out of hell up towards heaven and into heaven. [3] This the Lord does without the man’s knowing it, because if man knew it he would disturb the continuity of that process by leading himself. It is enough for man to learn truths from the Word, and by means of truths to know what good is, and from truths and goods what evils and falsities are, in order that he may be affected by truths and goods, and not be affected by falsities and evils. Before he knows goods and truths he may have a knowledge of evils and falsities, but he is not able to see them and perceive them. In this and in no other way can man be led from one affection into another in freedom and as if of himself. This is done by leading according to the affection of truth and good when man acknowledges the Lord’s Divine providence in every particular; and it is done by permission according to an affection for evil and falsity when man does not acknowledge such a providence.

Because of this signification of “dust” it was a custom in the representative churches to cast dust upon their heads when they had done evil and had repented of it, thus giving proof of their repentance. [2] That this was so can be seen from the following passages. In Ezekiel: They shall cry bitterly and shall cast up dust upon their heads, they shall roll themselves in ashes (Ezek. 27:30). “To cast up dust upon their heads” signifies mourning because of condemnation, and “to roll themselves in ashes” signifies still deeper mourning, for “ashes” signify what is condemned, because the fire from which they come signifies infernal love.

(Continuation) [3] All this having been premised it shall now be told what affection is, and afterwards why man is led by the Lord by means of affections and not by means of thoughts, and lastly that man can be saved in no other way. What affection is: the same is meant by affection as by love. But love is like a fountain and affections are like the streams therefrom, thus affections are continuations of love. Love as a fountain is in the will of man; affections, which are streams from it, flow by continuity into the understanding, and there by means of light from truths produce thoughts, just as the influences of heat in a garden produce germinations by means of rays of light. Moreover, love in its origin is the heat of heaven, and truths in their origin are the rays of light of heaven, and thoughts are germinations from their marriage. From such a marriage are all the societies of heaven, which are innumerable, which in their essence are affections; for they are from the heat that is love and from the wisdom that is light from the Lord as a sun. Therefore these societies, as heat in them is united to light, and light is united to heat, are affections of good and truth. From this are the thoughts of all in these societies. This makes clear that the societies of heaven are not thoughts but affections, consequently to be led by means of these societies is to be led by means of affections, that is, to be led by means of affections is to be led by means of societies; and for this reason in what now follows the term affections will be used in place of societies. [4] Why man is led by the Lord by means of affections and not by means of thoughts shall now be told.

Affections do not become evident to man, but thoughts do; also affections produce thoughts, but thoughts do not produce affections; there is an appearance that they do, but it is a fallacy. And when affections produce thoughts they produce all things of man, because these constitute his life. Moreover, this is known in the world. If you hold a man in his affection you hold him bound, and lead him wherever you please, and a single reason is then stronger than a thousand. But if you do not hold man in his affection reasons are of no avail, for his affection, when not in harmony with them, either perverts them or rejects them or extinguishes them. It would be similar if the Lord should lead man by means of thoughts immediately, and not by means of affections. Again, when a man is led by the Lord by means of affections, it seems to him as if he thought freely as if of himself, and spoke freely and acted freely as if of himself. And this is why the Lord does not teach man immediately, but mediately by means of the Word, and by means of doctrines and preachings from the Word, and by means of conversations and interaction with others; for from these things man thinks freely as if of himself. [5] In no other way can man be saved. This follows both from what has been said about the laws of the Divine providence and also from this, that thoughts do not produce affections in man. For if man knew all things of the Word, and all things of doctrine, even to the arcana of wisdom that the angels possess, and thought and spoke about them, so long as his affections were lusts of evil he could not be brought out of hell by the Lord. Evidently, then, if man were to be taught from heaven by an influx into his thoughts it would be like casting seed upon the way, or into water, or into snow, or into fire. 1176. Saying, Woe, woe, that great city, wherein all that had ships in the sea were made rich by reason of her costliness, signifies lamentation over the doctrine and religious persuasion by which all who confirmed them by reasonings from the natural man made gains. This is evident from the signification of “Woe, Woe,” as being lamentation (see n. 1165); from the signification of “the great city,” as being the doctrine and religious persuasion (see n."

(Continuation) [2] Because the Divine providence acts into the affections that belong to man’s love and thus to his will, leading him in and from his affection into another that is near and related to it by means of his freedom, and so imperceptibly that man has no knowledge of how it acts, and in fact hardly knows that there is a Divine providence; for this reason many deny providence, and confirm themselves against it. This is done in consequence of the various things that happen and arise, as that the arts and deceits of the wicked are successful, that impiety prevails, that there is a hell, that the understanding is blinded to spiritual things, and that this gives rise to so many heresies, each one of which, starting from a single head, flows out into assemblies and nations and becomes permanent, like popery, Lutheranism, Calvinism, Melancthonism, Moravianism, Arianism, Socinian ism, Quakerism, Enthusiasm, and even Judaism, and with these naturalism and atheism; and outside of Europe extending through many kingdoms, Mohammedanism, and also paganism, in which are various kinds of worship, and in some cases no worship at all. [3] All who do not think on these subjects from the Divine truth say in their heart that there is no Divine providence; and those who are perplexed about it assert that there is a Divine providence, but that it is only universal. When either of these hear that there is a Divine providence in every least particular of man’s life they either give no heed to it or do give heed to it; those who give no heed to it casting the truth behind them and turning away, and those who do"

Since, then, it is important that the blindness arising from ignorance, or the thick darkness arising from absence of light, should be dissipated, it is permitted to see (1) that the Lord teaches no one immediately, but mediately through those things in man that are from the hearing and sight.

[2] The enlightenment is as follows: light conjoined with heat flows in through heaven from the Lord. This heat, which is the Divine love, affects the will, from which man has the affection of good; and this light, which is the Divine wisdom, affects the understanding, from which man has the thought of truth. From these two fountains, which are the will and understanding, all things of man’s love and all things of his knowledge are affected; but only those things that pertain to the subject are called up and"

In this way is enlightenment effected by the Lord by means of the Word, in which everything, from the spiritual that is in it, communicates with heaven, and the Lord flows in through heaven into that which is at the time under man’s view; and the influx in everyone is continual and universal even to the minutest particulars. It is comparatively like the heat and light from the sun of the world, which operate upon each and every thing of the earth and give life according to the quality of the seed and the reception. What, then, must be the effect of the heat and light from the Divine sun, from which all things live? To be enlightened by the Lord through heaven is to be enlightened by the Holy Spirit, for the Holy Spirit is the Divine that proceeds from the Lord as a sun, from which is heaven. From this it is clear that the Lord teaches the man of the church mediately by means of the Word according to the love of his will that comes from his life, and according to the light of his understanding that he gains by means of knowledge; and that this cannot be otherwise, because this is the Divine order of influx. [3] And this is why the Christian religion has been divided into churches, and into heresies in general and in particular within the churches. Neither can those who are outside the Christian world, and who do not have the Word, be taught in any other way, for they are taught through the religious principle that they have instead of the Word, which is in part from the Word. The religious principle with the Mohammedans was in some respects taken from the Word of both Testaments. Others have a religious principle derived from the ancient Word that was afterwards lost. With some it was from the ancient church that extended over a great part of the continent of Asia, which, like our church at the present day, was divided into many, all of them having that ancient Word. From these the religious principles of many nations were derived, although in process of time these became in many cases more or less idolatrous.

It is like enlightenment at evening when the moon is shining more or less brightly, while enlightenment by means of the Word is like enlightenment in the daytime from morning to noon, when the sun is shining more or less brightly. Thus it is that the Lord’s church which, as to its light, which is Divine wisdom, extends through the entire globe, is like the day from noon to evening, and even to night; while as to its heat, which is Divine love, it is like the year from spring to autumn, and even to winter. 1178. Verse 20. Exult over her, O heaven, and ye holy apostles and prophets, for God hath judged your judgment upon her. 20. “Exult over her, O heaven, and ye holy apostles and prophets,” signifies joy of heart in heaven and in the church with those who are in wisdom and intelligence from the Word (n. 1179); “for God hath judged your judgment upon her” signifies on account of the rejection of these (n. 1180). 1179. Verse 20. Exult over her, O heaven, and ye holy apostles and prophets, signifies joy of heart in heaven and in the church with those who are in wisdom and intelligence from the Word. This is evident from the signification of “exulting,” as being joy of heart; also from the signification of “heaven,” as being not only heaven but also the church, since the church is the Lord’s heaven upon the earth; also from the signification of “apostles,” as being those who teach from the Word (see n. 100, 333), therefore those who are in wisdom; also from the signification of “prophets,” as being those who are in the doctrine of truth from the Word, and in an abstract sense doctrines themselves (see n. 624), therefore those who are in intelligence; for those who are in doctrine from the Word are called “intelligent,” while those who teach the Word are called “wise.” From all this it is clear that “Exult over her, O heaven, and ye holy apostles and prophets,” signifies joy of heart in heaven and in the church with those who are in wisdom and intelligence.

(On this see what is related from things seen and heard in Last Judgment.) (Continuation) [2] (2)And yet the Lord provides that man may be reformed and saved by those things that he adopts as his religion. In the entire globe where there is any religion, since there must be conjunction, there are two that constitute it, namely, God and man; and there are two things that constitute conjunction, namely, the good of love and the truth of faith; the good of love is from the Lord immediately, the truth of faith is also from God, but mediately. The good of love is that through which God leads man, and the truth of faith is that through which man is led. This is the same as what has been said above. The truth of faith appears to man to be his own, because it is from those things that he acquires as if from himself. Therefore God conjoins himself to man through the good of love, and man conjoins himself to God as if of himself through the truth of faith. Because the conjunction is such the Lord compares himself to a bridegroom and husband, and the church to a bride and wife. The Lord flows in continually with an abundance of the good of love, but he cannot be conjoined to man in the fullness of the truth of faith, but only in that which is with man, and this varies; it can be given in greater fullness with those who are where the Word is, and in less fullness with those who are where there is no Word; and yet the fullness varies in both in proportion to their knowledge and their life according to it, and consequently it may be greater with those who have not the Word than with those who have it. [3] The conjunction of God with man and of man with God is taught in the two tables that were written with the finger of God, and called “the tables of the covenant,” “of the testimony,” and “of the law.” In one table is God, in the other man. All nations that have any religion have these tables; from the first table they know that God must be acknowledged, regarded as holy, and worshiped; from the other table they know that they must not steal, either"

From his table man knows the evils that must be shunned, and just so far as he knows them and shuns them as if from himself, God conjoins the man to himself and enables him from his table to acknowledge him, to regard him as holy, and to worship him, and also enables him not to will evils, and so far as he does not will evils to know truths in abundance. Thus these two tables are conjoined with man, and God’s table is placed above man’s table, and they are put as one table into the ark, over which is the mercy seat, which is the Lord, and over the mercy seat the two cherubim which are the Word and what is from the Word, in which the Lord speaks with man as he spoke with Moses and Aaron between the cherubim. [4] Since, then, there is conjunction of the Lord with man and of man with the Lord by these means, evidently everyone who knows them and lives according to them, not merely from the civil and moral law, but also from the Divine law, will be saved; thus everyone in his own religion, whether Christian or Mohammedan or Gentile. And what is more, a man who from religion lives these truths, even if in the world he knows nothing about the Lord, nor anything else from the Word, yet he is in such a state as to his spirit that he wishes to become wise; consequently after death he is instructed by the angels and acknowledges the Lord and receives truths according to his affection and becomes an angel. Every such person is like a man who dies an infant, for he is led by the Lord and is educated by the angels. Those who from ignorance and from having been born in such a place have known nothing of worship, are after death instructed like little children, and according to their civil and moral life receive the means of salvation. I have seen such, and at first they did not appear like men; but afterwards I saw them as men, and heard them speaking sanely from the commandments of the Decalogue. To instruct such is the inmost angelic joy. From all this it is now clear that the Lord provides that every man can be saved."

(Continuation) (3) For every nation the Lord provides a universal means of salvation. From what has been said above it is clear that in whatever religion a man may live he can be saved; for he knows the evils and the falsities from evils that must be shunned, and having shunned them he knows the goods that must be done and the truths that must be believed. The goods he does and the truths he believes before he has shunned evils are not in themselves goods and truths, because they are from man and not from the Lord. Before that they are not goods and truths in themselves because in the man they then have no life. A man who knows all goods and all truths, as many as can be known, but does not shun evils, knows nothing. His goods and truths are swallowed up or cast out by the evils, so that he becomes foolish, not in the world but afterwards; while the man who knows few goods and few truths, but shuns evils, knows those goods and truths and learns many more and becomes wise, if not in the world yet afterwards. Since, then, everyone in every religion knows the evils and falsities from evils that must be shunned, and having shunned them knows the goods that must be done and the truths that must be believed, it is clear that this is provided by the Lord as the universal means of salvation with every nation that has any religion. [2] With Christians this means exists in all fullness; it also exists, though not in fullness, with Mohammedans and Gentiles. The remaining things, by which they are distinguished, are either ceremonials which are of little consequence, or are goods that may be done or not done, or truths that may be believed or not believed, and yet man be saved.

A Christian sees from the Word that God is one, that the Lord is the Savior of the world, that all good that is good in itself, and all truth that is true in itself, is from God, and nothing of it from man; that there must be baptism and the holy supper, that there is a heaven and that there is a hell, that there is a life after death, and that he who does good comes into heaven, and he who does evil into hell. These things he believes from truth and does from good when he is not in evil. Other things that are not in accord with these and with the Decalogue he may pass by. A Mohammedan sees from the Koran that God is one, that the Lord is the Son of God, and that all good is from God, that there is a heaven and that there is a hell, that there is a life after death, and that the evils forbidden in the commandments of the Decalogue must be shunned. If he does these latter things he also believes the former and is saved. A gentile sees from his religious principle that there is a God, that he must be regarded as holy and be worshiped, that good is from him, that there is a heaven and that there is a hell, that there is a life after death, that the evils forbidden in the Decalogue must be shunned. If he does these things and believes them he is saved. And as many gentiles perceive God to be man, and as God-man is the Lord, so after death when they are instructed by angels they acknowledge the Lord, and afterwards receive truths from the Lord that they had not before known. They are not condemned because of their not having the ordinances of baptism and the holy supper; the holy supper and baptism are for those only who are in possession of the Word, and to whom the Lord is known from the Word; for they are symbols of that church, and are attestations and certifications that those who believe and live according to the Lord’s commandments in the Word are saved. 1181.

Verse 21. And one strong angel took up a stone like a great millstone and cast into the sea, signifies confirmations of their doctrine from the Word cast with them into hell. This is evident from the signification of “strong angel,” as being the Divine truth in its power (see n. 130, 200, 302, 593, 800); also from the signification of a “millstone,” as being the confirmation of truth from the Word, and also the confirmation of falsity from the Word (of which presently); also from the signification of “casting into the sea,” as being into hell with them; that the “sea” signifies hell, may be seen (n. 537a, 538). A “millstone” signifies confirmation from the Word in both senses, because “wheat” signifies good, and “fine flour” its truth, therefore “a millstone,” by which wheat is ground into fine flour, or barley into meal, signifies the production of truth from good, or the production of falsity from evil, so, too, the confirmation of truth or of falsity from the Word; as can be seen from the following passages. In Jeremiah: I will take away from them the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the voice of the millstones and the light of the lamp (Jer. 25:10). Here, too, the joy of heaven and of the church is described, and “the voice of joy” signifies exultation of heart from the good of love, and “the voice of gladness” signifies glorification of soul from the truths of faith, for in the Word “joy” is predicated of good, and “gladness” of truth. “The voice of millstones” has a similar signification as “the voice of joy”; and “the light of the lamp” has a similar signification as “gladness,” namely, from the truth of faith. “The voice of millstones” signifies joy of heart from the good of love, because a millstone grinds wheat into fine flour, and “wheat” signifies the good of love, and “fine flour” truth from that good.

These words will be explained presently. In Isaiah: Take the millstone and grind meal, make bare the thigh passing through the rivers (Isa. 47:2). This is said of Babylon and Chaldea; and “to take the millstone and grind meal,” signifies to bring forth falsities from evil, and to confirm them by means of the Word; and “to make bare the thigh passing through the rivers,” signifies to adulterate goods by means of reasonings. In Lamentations: The young men they led away to grind, and the boys stumbled under the wood (Lam. 5:13). “To lead away the young men to grind,” signifies to compel those who are capable of understanding truths to falsify truths; “the boys stumble under the wood,” signifies to compel those who are capable of willing goods to adulterate goods, “to grind” being to falsify truths or to confirm falsities by means of the Word, “wood” being good. In Moses: Thou shalt not take the mill or the upper millstone for a pledge, for he receiveth the soul for a pledge (Deut. 24:6). This was among their laws, all of which corresponded to spiritual things. “Not to take a mill or millstone for a pledge” signified in the spiritual sense that the ability from good to understand truths must not be taken away from anyone, thus that no one must be deprived of goods and truths. Because this is the signification it is said, “for he receiveth the soul for a pledge,” which signifies that thus one would spiritually perish. In the same: They shall die even to the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the mill (Exod. 11:5)."

In the Gospels: Jesus said, Whoso shall cause one of these little ones that believe in me to stumble, it is profitable for him that an ass-millstone be hanged about his neck, and that he be sunk in the depths of the sea (Matt. 18:6; Mark 9:42; Luke 17:2). “To cause one of the little ones that believe in Jesus to stumble,” signifies to pervert those who acknowledge the Lord; “it is profitable that an ass-millstone be hanged about the neck,” signifies that it would be better for him not to know any good and truth, but only evil and falsity; this is meant by “ass millstone,” and “to be hanged about the neck” means cutting one off from knowing good and truth; “to be sunk in the depths of the sea,” signifies to be cast down to hell. This is profitable because to know goods and truths and to pervert them is to profane. What is meant by: Moses burnt the calf and ground it even to powder, and sprinkled it upon the face of the waters, and made the sons of Israel to drink of it (Exod. 32:20; Deut. 9:21), may be seen explained in Arcana Coelestia (n. 10462–10466)."

Many believe that man can be taught by the Lord by means of spirits speaking with him; but those who believe this and are willing to believe it do not know that it is attended with danger to their souls. So long as man is living in the world, as to his spirit he is in the midst of spirits, although spirits do not know that they are with man, nor does man know that he is with spirits; and for the reason that as to the affections of the will they are immediately conjoined, while as to the thoughts of the understanding they are mediately conjoined. For man thinks naturally, but spirits think spiritually; and natural and spiritual thought make one only by correspondences; and in a oneness by correspondences neither one of the two knows anything about the other. But as soon as spirits begin to speak with man they come out of their spiritual state into man’s natural state, and they then know that they are with man and they conjoin themselves with the thoughts of his affection and speak with him from those thoughts. They can enter into no other state of man, for all conjunction is by like affection and thought therefrom, while unlike separates. For this reason the speaking spirit must be in the same principles as the man is, whether they be true or false; and these he stirs up, and through his affection conjoined to man’s affection he strongly confirms them. This makes clear that none but like spirits speak with man, or manifestly operate into him, for manifest operation coincides with speech. Consequently only enthusiastic spirits speak with enthusiasts; only Quaker spirits operate upon Quakers, and only Moravian spirits upon Moravians. The same is true of Arians, Socinians, and other heretics. [5] All spirits that speak with man were once men in the world, and were then of like character. This has been granted me to know by repeated experience. And what is absurd, when a man believes that the Holy Spirit is speaking with him or operating upon him the spirit also believes himself to be the Holy Spirit.

Whenever a spirit from like affection favors man’s thoughts or principles, one leads the other as the blind lead the blind until both fall into the pit. The Pythonists formerly were of this character, also the magi in Egypt and in Babylon, who were called wise because they talked with spirits, and because they clearly perceived the operation of spirits in themselves. But by this the worship of God was changed into the worship of demons, and the church perished. For this reason such interaction was forbidden to the sons of Israel under penalty of death. 1183. Saying, Thus with violence shall Babylon, that great city, be cast down, and shall be found no more, signifies the total destruction of that doctrine, and that these shall not rise again. This is evident from the signification of “to be cast down with violence,” as being total destruction; also from the signification of “Babylon that great city,” as being that religious persuasion and its doctrine (of which frequently above); also from the signification of “found no more,” as being not to rise again. (Continuation) It is otherwise with those whom the Lord leads. He leads those who love truths, and who will them from himself. Such are enlightened when they read the Word; for the Lord is in the Word, and speaks with everyone according to his apprehension. When such hear the speech of spirits, as they sometimes do, they are not taught but led, and this with such precaution that the man is left to himself; for every man, as has been said before, is led by the Lord by means of affections, and from these he thinks as if from himself in freedom; if this were not so man would be incapable of reformation, nor could he be enlightened. But men are enlightened variously, each according to the quality of his affection and"

[2] This it has been given me to see, and from it to perceive clearly what comes from the Lord and what from angels. What has come from the Lord has been written; what has come from the angels has not. Moreover, it has been granted me to talk with angels as man with man, also to see the things that are in the heavens and that are in the hells; and for the reason that the end of the present church has come, and the beginning of a new one, which will be the New Jerusalem, is at hand; and to that it must be revealed that the Lord rules the universe, both heaven and the world; that there is a heaven and a hell, and what these are; that men live even as men after death, those who have been led by the Lord in heaven, but those who have been led by self in hell; that the Word is the Divine itself of the Lord on the earth; also that the last judgment is accomplished, that man may not expect it forever in this world; as well as many other things belonging to the light that is now arising after darkness. 1184.

Verse 22. And the voice of harpers and musicians and pipers and trumpeters shall not be heard in thee any more, signifies no more any interior or exterior joys. This is evident from the signification of the “voice or sound” of various instruments of music, as being joys from internal and external affections. They signify affections because of their harmony, for musical sounds express affections and produce them with joy. Stringed instruments signify spiritual things, and wind instruments celestial things, and that they correspond to affections may be seen (n. 323b, 326a). But what “the voice of the harp, the voice of the pipe, and the voice of the trumpet” signify in particular, can be seen only from the affections, which are of two kinds, spiritual and celestial; spiritual affections are from truths and celestial from goods; but they are of three degrees, inmost, middle, and ultimate; the inmost are such as are in the inmost heaven, the middle such as are in the middle heaven, and the ultimate such as are in the lowest heaven. (Continuation) [2] (10) The tenth law of the Divine providence is that man has led himself to eminence and riches by his own prudence, when these lead astray, for by the Divine providence man is led only to such things as do not lead astray and as are serviceable to eternal life; for all things of the Divine providence with man look to what is eternal, since the life which is God, from which man is man, is eternal. There are two things that especially influence the minds of men, eminence and riches; eminence relates to the love of glory and of honors, riches to the love of money and possessions. These"

I have seen the eminent and the rich in the heavens and I have seen them in the hells; therefore, as has been said, when eminence and riches do not lead astray they are from God, but when they do they are from hell. [3] In the world man does not distinguish between their being from God or from hell, because the natural man separated from the spiritual cannot perceive this distinction; but the distinction can be seen in the natural man that is from the spiritual, and yet with difficulty, because the natural man is taught from infancy to counterfeit the spiritual man; and in consequence when he performs uses to the church, to the country, to society and his fellow citizens, thus to the neighbor, he not only professes but also is able to persuade himself that he has done it for the sake of the church, the country, society, and his fellow citizens, and yet he may have done it for the sake of self and the world as ends. Man is in such blindness because he has not put away evils from himself by any combat; for so long as evils remain man can see nothing from the spiritual in his natural; he is like one in a dream who believes himself to be awake, or like a bird of night that sees the darkness as light. Such is the natural man when the gate of heavenly light is closed. Heavenly light is the spiritual that enlightens the natural man. Since, then, it is of the greatest importance to know whether eminence and riches, or the love of glory and honor, and the love of money and of possessions, are ends or are means, ends and means shall first be defined, for if these are ends they are curses, but if they are not ends, but means, they are blessings. 1186.

This is the signification of “craftsman of whatsoever craft,” because these are endowments of the understanding, and its endowments are signified by “crafts.” As these are signified by “crafts,” so in the Word where the construction of the tabernacle is treated of, also the garments of Aaron, which were of gold, blue, purple, scarlet double-dyed, and fine twined linen, it is said that they were to be the work of the “craftsman,” elsewhere “a work of a contriver” (Exod. 26:1, 31; 28:6; 39:8; and elsewhere). The things of which these were made, and which are here mentioned, signify things of wisdom, intelligence, and knowledge; therefore of Bezaleel and Oholiab, who were the craftsmen, and who made these things, it is said: They were filled with wisdom, intelligence, and knowledge (Exod. 31:3 seq.; 36:1–2 seq.). [2] That “craftsman” signifies intelligence from what is one’s own is evident in Hosea: They make them a molten image of their silver, and idols in their intelligence, all of it the work of the craftsmen (Hos. 13:2). “Molten image” and “idol” signify worship according to doctrine that is from self-intelligence; “silver” signifies the falsity from which such doctrine comes; therefore it is said “that in their intelligence they make them an idol, all of it the work of craftsmen.” So in Isaiah: The craftsman melteth a graven image, and the goldsmith spreadeth it over with gold, and casteth chains of silver; he seeketh a wise craftsman (Isa. 40:19–20). And in Jeremiah: Silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the craftsman and of the hands of the founder, hyacinthine and garments, all of it the work of the wise (Jer. 10:3, 9)."

(Continuation) [3] End, mediate causes, and effect, are called also the chief end, intermediate ends, and the final end. Intermediate and final ends are called ends, because the chief end produces them, is everything in them, is their esse and is their soul. The chief end is the will’s love in man, the intermediate ends are subordinate loves, and the final end is the love of the will existing as it were in its effigy. As the chief end is the love of the will it follows that intermediate ends, being subordinate loves, are foreseen, provided, and produced through the understanding, and that the final end is the use foreseen, provided, and produced by the love of the will through the understanding, for everything that love produces is a use. This must be premised in order that what has just been said may be perceived, namely, that eminence and riches may be blessings or that they may be curses. 1187. And the voice of the millstone shall not be heard in thee any more signifies no more any understanding of truth from the will of good. This is evident from the signification of “millstone,” as being the production of truth from good (see n. 1182); thus also the understanding of truth from the will of good, since the understanding is the recipient of truth, and the will the recipient of good. (Continuation) Now as the end, which is the love of man’s will, provides or acquires for itself through the understanding the means through which the final end may exist, to which the first end advances through the means, and this is the end coming into existence, which is the use, it follows that the end loves the means when they promote that use, and does not love them when they do not"

This makes clear the quality of a man whose chief end is the love of eminence, or the love of glory and honor, or whose chief end is the love of wealth, or love of money or possessions, namely, that he regards all means as servants that are serviceable to him for his final end, which is love coming into existence, and this love is use to himself. [2] Take, for example, a priest whose chief end is love of money or possessions, his means are the ministerial office, the Word, doctrine, learning, preaching from these, and instruction of men of the church and their reformation and salvation by means of these. These means are valued by him according to the end and for the sake of the end, and yet they are not loved, although with some they appear to be loved; for wealth is what is loved, since this is the first and the final end, and that end, as has been said, is everything in the means. Such assert, indeed, that their desire is that men of their church be taught, reformed, and saved; but as wealth is the end from which this is said, it is not said from their love, but only as means of acquiring reputation and gain for the sake of the end. [3] The same is true of a priest whose chief end is a love of eminence over others, as will be seen if gain or honor is separated from the means. It is wholly different when instruction, reformation, and salvation of souls is the chief end, and wealth and eminence are the means; for a priest is then a wholly different man, for he is a spiritual man, while the former is a natural man. With a spiritual priest wealth and eminence are blessings, but with a natural priest wealth and eminence are curses. This has been made evident by much experience in the spiritual world. Many have been seen and heard there who asserted that they had taught, had written, and had reformed men; but when the end or love of their will was disclosed, it was clear that they had done all things for the sake of self and the world, and nothing for the sake of God and the neighbor, and that they even cursed God and did evil to the neighbor. Such are meant in Matt. 7:22–23; and in Luke 13:26–27."

(Continuation) Take as another example a king, a prince, a magistrate, a governor, or an official, whose chief end is the love of rule, and whose means are all things belonging to their dominion, administration, and function. The uses they perform do not have the good of the kingdom, commonwealth, country, societies, and fellow citizens as their end, but delight in ruling, consequently self. The uses themselves are not to them uses, but minister to their pride. They perform uses for the sake of appearances and of distinction; they do not love them, but they commend and yet make light of them, just as a master does his servants. I have seen such after death, and have been amazed. They were devils among the burning; for when the love of rule is the chief end it is the very fire of hell. [2] I have also seen others whose chief end was not love of rule, but love of God and the neighbor, which is the love of uses; these were angels to whom dominion in the heavens was granted. From all this again it is clear that eminence may be a blessing or may be a curse, and that eminence as a blessing is from the Lord, and eminence as a curse is from the devil. What the love of rule is when it is the chief end, anyone who is wise can see from the kingdom that is meant in the Word by “Babylon,” that set its throne in the heavens above the Lord by claiming to itself all his authority; consequently it abrogated the Divine means of worship, which are from the Lord through the Word, and in their place instituted demoniacal means of worship, which are adorations of living and dead men, also of sepulchers, carcasses, and bones. That kingdom is described by “Lucifer” in Isaiah (14:4–24). But only those that"

This is evident from the signification of “bridegroom,” as being in the highest sense the Lord; also from the signification of “bride,” as being in that sense the church; and as the Lord flows into man from the Divine good of the Divine love, and is conjoined to the man of the church in the Divine truth, so “bridegroom and bride” mean the conjunction of the Lord with the church, and also the conjunction of good with truth. Because all spiritual joy is from that conjunction, it follows that “the voice of the bridegroom and bride” signifies the joy therefrom. Moreover, the angels have all their wisdom and intelligence, and thus all their joy and happiness from that conjunction and according to it. As this is the signification of “the voice of bridegroom and bride,” heavenly joy is described in other places in the Word by “bridegroom and bride.” As in Jeremiah: I will take away from them the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the voice of the millstone and the voice of the lamp (Jer. 25:10). Behold I cause to cease out of this place the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride (Jer. 16:9). I will cause to cease out of the cities of Judah, and out of the streets of Jerusalem, the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride (Jer. 7:34).

In these passages, “the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride” signify joy and gladness from the conjunction of the Lord with the church, and thus from the conjunction of good and truth, for the state of the church is here treated of; and the terms “joy and gladness” are also used, “joy” from good and “gladness” from truth. [2] So in Isaiah: I will rejoice in Jehovah, my soul shall exult in my God, as the bridegroom putteth on a miter, and as the bride adorneth herself with her jewels (Isa. 61:10). “To put on the miter” means to put on wisdom, and “to adorn herself with jewels” means with the knowledges of truth. In the same: As the joy of the bridegroom over the bride, so shall thy God rejoice over thee (Isa. 62:5). That the Lord is meant in the highest sense by the “bridegroom,” and the church by the “bride,”’ is evident in the Gospels: When the disciples of John asked about fasting, Jesus said as long as the bridegroom is with them the sons of the nuptials cannot fast; but the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them; then shall they fast (Matt. 9:15; Mark 2:19, 20; Luke 5:34–35). Here the Lord calls himself the “bridegroom” and the men of the church he calls “sons of the nuptials”; “to fast” signifies to mourn on account of the lack of truth and good. In Matthew: The kingdom of the heavens is likened to ten virgins, who took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom (Matt. 25:1–2 seq.). Here the “bridegroom” means the Lord, and “virgins” mean the church, and “lamps” signify the truths of faith. In John:"

The “new Jerusalem” means the new church. Again: Come, I will show thee the bride, the wife of the Lamb; and he showed me the city Jerusalem (Rev. 21:9–10). The spirit and the bride say, Come; and he that heareth, let him say, Come (Rev. 22:17). “The spirit and the bride” signify the church as to good and truth. (Continuation) [3] As the love of rule and the love of riches prevail universally in the Christian world, and these loves at this day are so deeply rooted that it is not known that they in any wise lead astray, it is important that their quality should be set forth. They lead every man astray who does not shun evils because they are sins; for he who does not thus shun evils does not fear God, and therefore remains natural. And as the love of ruling and the love of riches are the natural man’s own loves, he does not see with any interior acknowledgment what the quality of those loves is in him. This he does not see unless he is reformed, and he can be reformed only by combat against evils. It is believed that he can be reformed by faith; but there can be no faith of God in man until he fights against evils. When man has thus been reformed light flows in from the Lord through heaven and gives him the affection of seeing and the ability to see what those loves are, and whether they rule or serve in him, thus whether they are in the first place in him and make as it were the head, or are in the second place and make as it were the"

[4] I can assert that all in whom the love of rule is in the first place are inwardly devils. This love is known from its delight, for it exceeds every other delight of the life of man. It is continually exhaled from hell, and the exhalation appears like the fire of a great furnace, kindling the hearts of men whom the Lord does not protect from it. The Lord protects all who are reformed. Nevertheless, the former although in hell, are led by the Lord but only by means of external bonds, which are fears on account of the penalties of the law and the loss of reputation, honor, gain, and consequently pleasures. He leads them also by means of worldly rewards. He cannot lead them out of hell because the love of rule does not admit of internal bonds, which are the fear of God and affections of good and truth, by means of which the Lord leads all who will follow him to heaven and in heaven. 1190.

Such are meant in this chapter, but not those who are under their dominion. These indeed venerate and adore them, but they do this from a faith induced by authority, and thus from obedience, and this faith and obedience are from ignorance. These have no share in dominion, therefore the things said in this chapter of Babylon as the harlot are not said of these."

The heavens are divided into societies, and those who are eminent and rich are to be found in every society. The eminent there are in such glory, and the rich in such abundance, that the glory and abundance of the world are almost nothing in comparison. But all the eminent there are wise, and all the rich abound in knowledge; thus eminence there is wisdom and wealth there is knowledge. Such eminence and wealth can be acquired in this world, both by those who are eminent and rich and by those who are not, for they are acquired here by all who love wisdom and knowledge. To love wisdom is to love uses that are true uses, and to love knowledge is to love the cognitions of good and truth for the sake of such uses. When uses are loved more than self and the world, and the cognitions of good and truth are loved for the sake of uses, uses have the first place and eminence and wealth the second place; and this is the case with all who are eminent and rich in the heavens.

From all this it is clear that “the blood of prophets and of saints found in her” signifies the violence offered by them to every truth and thus to every good of doctrine from the Word. (Continuation) [2] Something shall now be said about the uses through which men and angels have wisdom. To love uses is nothing else than to love the neighbor, for use in the spiritual sense is the neighbor. This can be seen from the fact that everyone loves another not because of his face and body, but from his will and understanding; he loves one who has a good will and a good understanding, and does not love one with a good will and a bad understanding, or with a good understanding and a bad will. And as a man is loved or not loved for these reasons, it follows that the neighbor is that from which everyone is a man, and that is his spiritual. Place ten men before your eyes that you may choose one of them to be your associate in any duty or business; will you first find out about them and choose the one who comes nearest to your use? Therefore he is your neighbor, and is loved more than the others. Or become acquainted with ten maidens with the purpose of choosing one of them for your wife; do you not at first ascertain the character of each one, and if she consents betroth to you the one that you love? That one is more your neighbor than the others. If you should say to yourself, “Every man is my neighbor, and is therefore to be loved without distinction,” a devil-man and an angel-man or a harlot and a virgin might be equally loved. Use is the neighbor, because every man is valued and loved not for his will and understanding alone, but for the uses he performs or is able to perform from these. Therefore a man of use is a man according to his use; and a man not of use is a man not a man, for of such a man it is said that he is not useful for anything; and although in this world he may be tolerated in a community so long"

But uses are manifold; in general they are heavenly or infernal. Heavenly uses are those that are serviceable more or less, or more nearly or remotely, to the church, to the country, to society, and to a fellow citizen, for the sake of these as ends; but infernal uses are those that are serviceable only to the man himself and those dependent on him; and if serviceable to the church, to the country, to society, or to a fellow citizen, it is not for the sake of these as ends, but for the sake of self as the end. And yet everyone ought from love, though not from self-love, to provide the necessaries and requisites of life for himself and those dependent on him. [4] When man loves uses by doing them in the first place, and loves the world and self in the second place, the former constitutes his spiritual and the latter his natural; and the spiritual rules, and the natural serves. This makes evident what the spiritual is, and what the natural is. This is the meaning of the Lord’s words in Matthew: Seek ye first the kingdom of the heavens6 and its justice, and all things shall be added unto you (Matt. 6:33). “The kingdom of the heavens” means the Lord and his church, and “justice” means spiritual, moral, and civil good; and every good that is done from the love of these is a use. Then “all things shall be added,” because when use is in the first place, the Lord, from whom is all good, is in the first place and rules, and gives whatever contributes to eternal life and happiness; for, as has been said, all things of the Lord’s Divine providence pertaining to man look to what is eternal. “All things that shall be added” refer to food and raiment, because food means everything internal that nourishes the soul, and raiment everything external that like the body clothes it. Everything internal has reference to love and wisdom, and everything external to wealth and eminence. All this makes clear what is meant by loving uses for the sake of uses, and what the uses"

This is evident from the signification of the “slain,” as being those who had perished by falsities and evils (see n. 315a, c, d, 366); “to slay” being to deprive others of their truths and goods by falsities and evils (see n. 547, 572, 589); also from the signification of the “earth,” as being the church (of which frequently); therefore “the blood of all that had been slain upon the earth” signifies violence offered to every truth and good by falsities and evils, by which those who were of the church perished. (Continuation) As man was created to perform uses, and this is to love the neighbor, so all who come into heaven, however many there are, must do uses. All the delight and blessedness of these is according to uses and to the love of uses. Heavenly joy is from no other source. He who believes that such joy is possible in idleness is much deceived. No idle person is tolerated even in hell. Those who are there are in workhouses and under a judge who imposes tasks on the prisoners that they must do daily. To those who do not do them neither food nor clothing is given, but they stand hungry and naked; thus are they compelled to work there. The difference is that in hell uses are done from fear, but in heaven from love; and fear does not give joy, but love does. Nevertheless it is proper to vary occupations in different ways in company with others, and these serve as recreations, which are also uses. It has been granted me to see many things in heaven, many things in the world, and many things in the human body, and to consider at the same time their uses; and it has been revealed that every particular thing in them, both great and small, was created from use, in use, and for use; and that the part in which the ultimate that is for use ceases is separated as harmful and is cast out as condemned."

(Continuation) [2] Something shall now be said about the life of animals, and afterwards about the soul of vegetables. The whole world, with each and every thing in it, came into existence and continues to exist from the Lord the creator of the universe. There are two suns, the sun of the spiritual world and the sun of the natural world. The sun of the spiritual world is the Lord’s Divine love, the sun of the natural world is pure fire. From the sun that is the Divine love every work of creation has begun, and by means of the sun that is fire it has been carried to completion. [3] Everything that proceeds from the sun that is the Divine love is called spiritual, and everything that proceeds from the sun that is fire is called natural. The spiritual from its origin has life in itself, but the natural from its origin has nothing of life in itself. And because from these two fountains of the universe all things that are in both worlds have come into existence and continue to exist, it follows that there is in every created thing in this world a spiritual and a natural, a spiritual as its soul and a natural as its body, or a"

That these two in any particular thing cannot be separated every wise person knows, for if you separate cause from effect or the internal from the external, the effect or the external goes to pieces, as when the soul is separated from the body. [4] That there is such a conjunction in the particular and even in the most particular things of nature has not yet been known. It has not been known because of the existing ignorance respecting the spiritual world, the sun there, and heat and light there, and because of the insanity of sensual men in ascribing all things to nature, and rarely anything to God except creation in general; and yet not the least thing is possible or can be possible in nature in which there is not a spiritual.

Saying, Alleluia, signifies the glorification of the Lord, as is evident from the signification of “Alleluia,” as being the glorification of the Lord; for in the original language “Alleluia” means, Praise ye God, and thus, Glorify ye the Lord.

That there is such a union of things spiritual and things natural in each and all of the subjects and objects of the animal kingdom is evident from the many wonderful things that have been observed in that kingdom by learned men and societies, and recorded to be studied by those who investigate causes. It is generally known that animals of all kinds, great and small, both those that walk and creep on the earth and those that fly in the air and swim in the waters, know from something innate and implanted that is called instinct, and also nature, how their species is to be propagated; how the young when born or brought forth are to be reared, and on what food they are to be fed; also they know their proper food from mere sight, smell, or taste, and where to seek and gather it, also they know their own places of habitation and resort, also where their companions and mates are by hearing the sounds they make; also they know from the variations of the sound what they desire. The knowledge of such things, viewed in itself, as well as the affection from which it is derived, is spiritual; but the knowledge and affection are clothed from nature and are produced through nature. [3] Moreover, in respect to the organs, members, and viscera of the body, and in respect to their uses, animal and man are wholly alike. An animal, like a man, has eyes and thus sight, ears and thus hearing, nostrils and thus smell, a mouth and tongue and thus taste, also the cuticular sense with all its variations in every part of the body. In regard to the interiors of the body they have like viscera, they have two brains, a heart and lungs, a stomach, liver, pancreas, spleen, mesentery, intestines, with the other organs for chyle making, blood making, and purification; also the organs of"

The likeness is such that man in respect to these things is an animal. That all these things in man have a correspondence with the societies of heaven has been shown in many places in Arcana Coelestia; consequently the same is true of animals. From this correspondence it is clear that the spiritual acts into the natural and produces its effects by means of the natural, as the principal cause does by means of its instrumental cause. But these are only general evidences that bear witness to the conjunction in that kingdom. 1198. Salvation and glory and honor and power unto the Lord our God signifies because eternal life is from the Lord through the Divine truth and the Divine good from his Divine omnipotence. This is evident from the signification of “salvation,” as being eternal life; also from the signification of “glory and honor,” as being the Lord’s Divine truth and Divine good (see n. 288, 345); also from the signification of “power,” as being, in reference to the Lord, omnipotence; and as the Lord is called in the Word “Jehovah” and “Lord” from the Divine good, and “God” from the Divine truth, and Divine good and truth are signified by “glory and honor,” so it is said, “the Lord our God.” In the sense of the letter, “salvation, glory, honor, and power” are mentioned separately, but in the spiritual sense they are joined into one meaning, which is, that eternal life is from the Lord through the Divine truth and the Divine good from the Divine omnipotence. The same is true of many other passages of the Word. Sometimes mere names of countries and cities are enumerated that appear disconnected in the sense of the letter, but in the spiritual sense they combine into one continuous sense. (Continuation) [2] The particular evidences that furnish like testimony are still more numerous and more striking. With some kinds of animals these are such that a sensual man, whose thoughts are confined to matter, compares the things pertaining to beasts with those pertaining to man, and from foolish intelligence concludes that"

The evidences that so testify and by which the sensual man is deluded are that certain animals seem to have prudence and cunning, connubial love, friendship and seeming charity, probity, and benevolence; in a word, a morality the same as with men. For example, dogs, from a genius innate in them, know how to act as faithful guards as if from their own nature; from the transpiration of their master’s affection they know as it were his will; they search him out by perceiving the scent of his footsteps and clothes; they know the different quarters and find their way home, even through pathless regions and dense forests; with other like things; from which the sensual man concludes that a dog has knowledge, intelligence and wisdom. Nor is this to be wondered at when he ascribes all such things, both in the dog and in himself, to nature. But the spiritual man on the other hand sees that there is something spiritual that leads, and that this is joined to the natural. [3] These particular evidences, again, are that birds know how to build their nests, to lay eggs in them, to brood over them, to hatch their young, and afterwards from a love called storge to provide for them warmth under their wings and food out of their mouths, until they become clothed with feathers and furnished with wings, when they of themselves come into all the knowledge of their parents from the spiritual which is their soul, and from which they provide for themselves. These particular evidences, again, are all things that are contained in eggs. In the egg the rudiment of a new bird lies hidden, encompassed by every element necessary to the formation of the fetus, from its beginnings in the head to the full formation of all things of the body. Is it possible that nature should provide such things? For this is not only bringing forth, it is also creating; and nature does not create. What has nature in common with life except that life may be clothed by nature, and thus put itself forth and appear in form as an animal? Among particular evidences furnishing the same testimony are those seen in worms of vegetables when in undergoing their metamorphosis, they encompass themselves as with a womb that they may be born again, in which they are changed into nymphs and chrysalises, and"

A spiritual man sees that this emulates the rebirth of man, and is a representative of his resurrection, and thus is spiritual. [4] Still more striking evidences are seen with bees, which have a government after the form of human governments. They build for themselves little houses of wax according to the rules of art in a series, with commodious passages for transit; they fill the cells with honey collected from flowers; they appoint over themselves a queen to be the common parent of a future race; she dwells above her people in the midst of her guards; and when she is about to bring forth they follow her, with a mixed multitude after them; thus she goes from cell to cell, and lays a little egg in each, and so continually until her matrix is emptied, when she returns to her home; this she does repeatedly. Her guards, which are called drones because they perform no other use than as so many servants to one mistress, and perhaps inspire her with something of amatory desire, and because they do no work, are judged useless; and for this reason, and lest they should seize and consume the gains and work of others, they are brought out and deprived of their wings. Thus the community is purged of its idle members. Moreover, when the new progeny is grown up, they are commanded by a general voice, which is heard as a murmur, to depart and to seek a home and food for themselves. And they go out and collect into a swarm, and institute a like order in a new hive. These and many other things which investigators have discovered and published in books are not unlike the governments that have been instituted and ordained in kingdoms and commonwealths by human intelligence and wisdom, according to the laws of justice and judgment. Moreover, like men, they know as it were the approach of winter, for which they gather food lest they should die of hunger. Who can deny that such things are from a spiritual origin, or can believe that they can possibly be from any other origin?

From this it is clear that their soul is nothing else; and that there are given as many genera and species of animals as there are genera and species of affections. It will be seen in what follows that the affections that are represented in the spiritual world by animals are not interior spiritual affections, but are exterior spiritual affections that are called natural; also that there is not a hair or fiber of wool on any beast, or a filament of a quill or feather upon any bird, or a point of a fin or scale on any fish, that is not from the life of their soul, thus that is not from the spiritual clothed by the natural.

But in the world of spirits camels, elephants, horses, asses, oxen, deer, lions, leopards, bears, also eagles, kites, magpies, peacocks, and quails are seen. I have also seen there composite animals, like those seen by the prophets and described in the Word (as in Rev. 13:2, and elsewhere). [4] As the animals that appear in that world bear such a resemblance to the animals in this world that no difference is discernible, and as the animals in that world derive their existence from the affections of the angels of heaven, or from the lusts of the spirits of hell, it follows that natural affections or lusts are their souls, and when these have been clothed with a body they are animals in form. But what affection or cupidity is the soul of this or that animal, either a beast or a wild beast of the earth, a bird of day or of the night, or a fish of limpid or fetid water, will not be explained here. These are mentioned frequently in the Word, and have a signification there in accordance with their souls. The signification of lambs, sheep, she-goats, rams, kids, he-goats, bullocks, oxen, camels, horses, asses, deer, and various kinds of birds, has been disclosed in Arcana Coelestia, and may be seen there."

This is evident from the signification of “the earth,” as being the church; also from the signification of “corrupting it with whoredom,” as being to falsify all its truths and to adulterate all its goods (n. 141, 161, 1083, 1130). That such have falsified the truths of the Word is evident from this, that they have little regard for the Word; but from what is their own [proprium] they devise new statutes, judgments, and commandments, most of which have regard to dominion over the church and heaven as an end, and these are all falsified truths. That the goods of the church are also adulterated is evident from this, that they call holy all things given to their monasteries and idols, and also to the papal chair, and call such gifts good works, and yet they thereby despoil homes, and deprive widows and orphans of their goods; and this they do notwithstanding they dwell amid treasures and possess superabundant revenues. Moreover, they make such works meritorious, and do many other like things. (Continuation) [2] These things being premised, what the soul of beasts is shall be told. The soul of beasts, regarded in itself, is spiritual; for affection of whatever kind, whether good or evil, is spiritual, for it is a derivation from some love, and has its origin in the heat and light that proceed from the Lord as a sun; and whatever proceeds from that is spiritual. That the evil affections that are called lusts are from the same source is evident from what has been already said about the evil loves and insane cupidities therefrom of infernal genii and spirits. [3] Beasts and wild beasts, as mice, poisonous serpents, crocodiles, basilisks, vipers, and the like, with the various noxious insects, the souls of which are like evil affections, were not created from the beginning, but they originated with hell in stagnant lakes, marshes, rank and fetid waters, and in the effluvia from dead bodies, dung, and urine, with which the malignant loves of infernal societies have communication. That such communication exists has"

Moreover, in everything spiritual there is a plastic force wherever homogeneous exhalations are present in nature; and in everything spiritual there is also a propagative force, for the spiritual gives form by means of wombs or eggs not only to the organs of sense and motion, but also to the organs of prolification. But from the beginning useful and clean beasts only were created, the souls of which are good affections. [4] It must be known, however, that the souls of beasts are not spiritual in the same degree in which the souls of men are spiritual, but in a lower degree. For there are degrees in things spiritual; and although affections of a lower degree, regarded in their origin, are spiritual, they must be termed natural. They must be so called because they are like the affections of the natural man. In man there are three degrees of natural affections, and the same is true of beasts. In the lowest degree are insects of various kinds, in a higher degree are the flying things of heaven, and in a still higher degree are the beasts of the earth which were created from the beginning. 1202. And he hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand signifies the deliverance of those that are in Divine truths from the Lord by the casting out of the Babylonians. This is evident from the signification of “avenging at her hand,” as being to deliver from those who are meant by “Babylon” as a “harlot,” also from the signification of “the blood of servants,” as being violence done to those who are in truths from the Lord, “blood” being violence done, and “servants” those who are in truths from the Lord. Why such are called “servants” may be seen above (n. 6, 409). (Continuation) [2] The difference between men and beasts is like that between wakefulness and dreaming, or between light and shade. Man is both spiritual and natural, while a beast is not spiritual but natural. Man has a will and an understanding, and his will is a receptacle of the heat of heaven, which is love, and his understanding is a receptacle of the light of heaven, which is wisdom.

But with a beast affection and knowledge make one and cannot be separated; for a beast knows what belongs to its affection and is affected by what belongs to its knowledge. And because with a beast these two faculties, called knowledge and affection, cannot be separated, a beast could not destroy the order of its life. Hence it is born into all the knowledge belonging to its affection. With man it is otherwise. His two faculties for life, which are called the understanding and the will, can be separated, as has been said, therefore he has the ability to destroy the order of his life by thinking contrary to his will and willing contrary to his understanding, and in this way he has destroyed it. For this reason man is born into mere ignorance, that he may be led out of it into order through knowledges by means of his understanding. [4] The order into which man was created is to love God above all things and the neighbor as himself; and the state into which man has come since he destroyed that order is loving himself above all things and the world as himself. Since man has a spiritual mind, which is above his natural mind, and his spiritual mind is able to contemplate such things as pertain to heaven and the church, as well as such things as pertain to the state in respect to morals and laws, and all these have reference to truths and goods, which are called spiritual, moral, and civil, with the natural things pertaining to knowledges, and also have reference to their opposites, which are falsities and evils, for this reason man is able both to think analytically and draw conclusions and also to receive influx through heaven from the Lord, and become intelligent and wise. This no beast is capable of. What a beast knows is not from any understanding, but is from the knowledge that belongs to its affection, which is its soul.

[5] Because man has both a spiritual mind and a natural mind, and his spiritual mind is above his natural mind, and the spiritual mind is such as to be able to contemplate and love truths and goods in every degree, either conjointly with the natural mind or abstracted from it, it follows that the interiors of man belonging to each mind are capable of being raised up by the Lord to the Lord and of being conjoined to him; and this is why every man lives eternally. This is not so with beasts. A beast does not possess any spiritual mind, it has only a natural mind; and therefore its interiors, which belong solely to knowledge and affection, cannot be raised up by the Lord and conjoined to him, and for this reason a beast does not live after death. [6] A beast indeed is led by a sort of spiritual influx falling into its soul; but since its spiritual is incapable of being elevated it can only be determined downwards, and can look only to such things as belong to its affection, which have reference solely to what pertains to nourishment, habitation, and propagation; and it can know these only from the knowledge pertaining to its affection by means of light, odor, and taste. Because man is able by virtue of his spiritual mind to think rationally, he is also able to speak, for to speak belongs to thought from the understanding, which is able to see truths in spiritual light. But a beast, which has no thought from understanding, but only knowledge from affection, is only able to utter sounds, and to vary the sound of its affection according to its appetites. 1203.

(Continuation) [2] Something shall now be said about the vegetable kingdom, and its soul, which is called the plant soul. That this, too, is spiritual is not known in the world. By the plant soul is meant the tendency and effort to produce a plant from its seed progressively even to new seeds, and thereby to multiply itself to infinity, and to propagate itself to eternity; for there is as it were in every plant an idea of what is infinite and eternal; for a single seed can be so multiplied during a certain number of years as to fill the whole earth, and can also be propagated from seed to seed without end. This, with the wonderful process of growth from the root into a sprout, then into a stalk, also into branches, leaves, flowers, fruits, even into new seeds, is not a natural but a spiritual power. Likewise, plants have in many respects a relation to such things as belong to the animal kingdom, as that they exist from seed, in which there is as it were a prolific power, they produce a sprout like an infant, a stalk like a body, branches like arms, a top like a head, barks like skins, leaves like lungs, they grow in years, and afterwards blossom like maidens before their nuptials, and after these they expand like wombs or eggs, and bring forth fruit like offspring, in which are contained new seeds, from which, as in the animal kingdom, spring new prolifications or fructifications of the same kind or stock. These and many other things that are observed by those skilled in the art of botany who have traced a parallel between the two kingdoms, indicate that the tendency and effort to such things are not from the natural world but from the spiritual. That the living force as the principal cause is the spiritual, and that the dead force as the instrumental cause is the natural, will be seen in what follows."

(That “the ages of the ages” signifies eternity may be seen n. 289, 468.) (Continuation) How the spiritual flows in and acts upon plants and produces such a tendency, effort, and action, cannot be comprehended by any understanding, unless the following are first unfolded: (1) Nothing in nature exists and subsists except from the spiritual and by means of it. (2) Nature in itself is dead, being created that the spiritual may be clothed by it with forms that may serve for use, and thus may be terminated. (3) There are two general forms, the spiritual and the natural; the spiritual is such as belongs to animals, and the natural is such as belongs to vegetables. (4) In everything spiritual there are three forces, an active force, a creative force, and a formative force. (5) From the spiritual by means of these forces both plants and animals, both those which appear in heaven and those which are in the world, have their existence.

Verse 4. And the twenty-four elders and the four animals fell down signifies humiliation of heart of the higher heavens. This is evident from the signification of “falling down,” as meaning humiliation of heart (of which presently); also from the signification of “the twenty-four elders” and “the four animals,” as being the higher heavens and the angels there (see n. 313, 322, 362, 462). “To fall down” means humiliation of heart, because falling down upon the knees and upon the face is a gesture corresponding to inmost humiliation, which is called humiliation of heart; for by creation there are gestures corresponding to every affection, and a man falls into them spontaneously when he comes into the affection, provided he has not learned to counterfeit affections that are foreign to him; while one who has learned so to do takes on gestures from himself by which he depicts affections of the heart, although they do not belong at all to his heart. Such can fall down before God, but it is a purely counterfeit act. This has been said to make known that “falling down before God” means to act from inmost affection, which is called humiliation of heart; this precedes worship, which is an act of the lips. (Continuation) [2] (1) Nothing in nature exists except from the spiritual and by means of it. The reason of this is that nothing can exist except from another, and so finally from him who is and exists in himself, who is God; wherefore God is called esse and existere, Jah from esse and Jehovah from esse and existere in himself.

Its essence from which it exists is the spiritual, because this has in itself the Divine esse, and also the Divine active, creative, and formative force, as will be seen in what follows. Moreover, this essence may be called soul. For everything spiritual is living, and what is living, when it acts into what is not living, as for instance into the natural, causes it either as it were to be living, or to draw somewhat of appearance from what is living. This latter is true of plants, the former of animals. [3] Nothing in nature exists except from the spiritual, because no effect is possible without a cause. Whatever exists in effect is from a cause; what is not from a cause is separated. Thus it is with nature. Its particular and most particular parts are effects from a cause which is prior, interior, and superior to the effect, and which is immediately from God. For there is a spiritual world; and that world is prior, interior and superior to the natural world, consequently everything in the spiritual world is a cause, and everything in the natural world is an effect. Even in the natural world one thing exists from another in a progression, but this is done through causes from the spiritual world, for where the cause of the effect is, there also is the cause of the effecting effect; for every effect becomes an effecting cause in order even to the lowest, where the effective force subsists; but this is effected continually from the spiritual, in which alone is that force. This, therefore, is what is meant by “nothing in nature exists except from the spiritual, and by means of it.” [4] In nature there are two mediate causes by means of which every effect, that is, every production and formation there, is accomplished. These mediate causes are light and heat. Light modifies substances and the heat moves them, each from the presence of the sun in them. The presence of the sun that is manifested as light causes an activity of the forces or substances of every particle according to the form that it has from creation. This is modification. The presence of the sun that is perceived as heat expands the particles, and produces the acting and effecting forces according to their form, by moving the conatus that they have from"

And adored God who sitteth upon the throne, signifies adoration of the Lord, who has all power in the heavens and on the earth. This is evident from the signification of “adoring,” as being here adoration from humiliation of heart; also from the signification of “who sitteth upon the throne,” as being who has power in the heavens and on the earth, for “the throne” means in reference to the Lord the whole heaven and also all power there. All power on the earth is also meant because power in the heavens cannot be separated from power on the earth; for the spiritual world, in which are the heavens and the hells, cannot be separated from the natural world; thus angels and spirits cannot be separated from men, for they are consociated and conjoined; for as to the thoughts of his understanding and the affections of his will every man is in the spiritual world, in the societies there, thus with angels of heaven on the one hand or with spirits of hell on the other. For as to his thoughts and affections man is a spirit; consequently after death, when he becomes a spirit, he comes into the societies in which he was while in the world. This makes clear that since the Lord has power in the heavens he has power also on the earth, and that the one cannot be separated from the other. By “God” here and elsewhere in the Word, the Lord is meant, because he has all power in the heavens and on the earth, as he himself teaches in the Word, for he alone is God.

That nature is serviceable in clothing the spiritual is manifest from the fact that the souls of beasts, which are spiritual affections, are clothed with materials that exist in the world. That their bodies, as well as the bodies of men, are material, is well known. [3] The spiritual can be clothed by the material, because all things that exist in the world of nature, atmospheric, aqueous, or earthy, as to every particle thereof, are effects produced by the spiritual as a cause, and the effects act as one with the cause and wholly in agreement with it, according to this axiom, that nothing exists in the effect that is not in the cause. But there is this difference, that the cause is a living force because it is spiritual, while the effect is a dead force because it is natural. This is the reason why such things exist in the natural world as wholly agree with those in the spiritual world, and why the two can be closely conjoined. And these are the reasons for saying that nature was created in order that by it the spiritual might be clothed with forms that might serve for use. [4] That nature was created in order that the spiritual might be terminated in it, follows from what has been said, that the things in the spiritual world are causes, and those in the natural world are effects. Effects are terminations. Where there is a first there must always be a last, and as everything intermediate from the first exists together in the last, the work of creation is perfected in things last. For this end the sun of the world was created, and nature by means of the sun, and finally the terraqueous globe, in order that there might be ultimate materials into which everything spiritual might close, and in which creation might subsist; also in order that the work of creation might continually persist and endure, which is effected through the generations of men and animals and the germinations of plants; also in order that all things might thus return to their first source, which is effected through man. That intermediates exist together in ultimates is evident from the axiom that there is nothing in the effect that is not in the cause, thus from"

(Continuation) [2] (3) There are two general forms, the spiritual and the natural; the spiritual is such as belongs to animals, and the natural is such as belongs to plants. This is why all things of nature, except the sun, moon, and the atmospheres, constitute three kingdoms, the animal, the vegetable, and the mineral, and the mineral kingdom is simply a storehouse, in which are contained and from which are taken the things of which the forms of the other kingdoms, the animal and the vegetable, are composed. [3] The forms of the animal kingdom, which are called in a single word, animals, are all in accord with the flow of spiritual substances and forces; and from the conatus that is in these forms this flow tends to the human form, and to each and all things of it from head to heel; thus it tends in general to produce the organs of sense and the organs of motion, also the organs of nutrition and the organs of prolification. For this reason the entire heaven is in such a form, and all angels and spirits are such a form, and men on the earth are in such a form, and all beasts, birds, and fishes, for all these have like organs. [4] This animal form derives its conatus to such things from the first from whom all things are, who is God, because he is man.

[5] But the other form, which is the natural form, and which is the form of all plants, has its origin in the conatus and consequent flow of natural forces, which are atmospheres, and are called ethers; and in these this conatus is present from that determination of spiritual forces which is in the animal form, and from the continual operation of spiritual forces into natural forces, which are ethers, and through these into the materials of the earth, of which plants are composed. That its origin is such is clear from what has been said above that a certain semblance of the animal form is evident in them. [6] That all things of nature strive after that form, and that the ethers have impressed upon them and so implanted in them from the spiritual an effort to produce that form, is evident from many things; as from all vegetation on the surface of the whole earth, also from the vegetation of minerals into such forms in mines, where openings exist, also from the vegetation of cretaceous substances into corals in the depths of the sea, and even from the forms of snowflakes that emulate plant forms. 1209.

The angels of whom heaven consists do not make anything of heaven from what is of their own; but it is the Divine with them that proceeds from the Lord that makes heaven; and this is why “a voice out of heaven” signifies the unanimity of all the heavens, or of the whole heaven.

The active force, because it is spiritual, proceeds from the fountain of all forces, which is the sun of heaven, and that is the Lord’s Divine love, and love is the active itself, from which the living force which is life proceeds. [3] The creative force is the force that produces causes and effects from beginning to end, and reaches from the first through intermediates to the last. The first is the sun of heaven itself, which is the Lord; intermediates are things spiritual, afterwards things natural, also things terrestrial, from which finally are productions. And as in the creation of the universe that force proceeded from the first to the last, so afterwards it proceeds in like manner in order that productions may be continual; otherwise they would fail. For the first continually regards the last as an end; and unless the first looked to the last continually from itself through intermediates according to the order of creation, all things would perish; therefore productions, which are especially animals and plants, are continuations of creation. It does not matter that the continuations are effected by seeds, it is still the same creative force that produces. Moreover, it is according to the observation of some that certain seeds are yet being produced. [4] The formative force is the last force from ultimates, for it is the force that produces animals and plants from the ultimate materials of nature, which are collected in the earth. The forces that are in nature from its origin, which is the sun of the world, are not living forces but dead forces. These do not differ from the forces of heat in man and animal, which keep the body in such a state that the will by means of affection, and the understanding by means of thought, which are spiritual, can flow in and do their work in it. They do not differ from the forces of light in the eye, which simply cause the mind, which is spiritual, to see by means of its organ, the eye.

Saying, Praise God, all ye his servants, signifies worship of the Lord by those who are in truths. This is evident from the signification of “praising God,” as being to confess and worship him (of which presently); also from the signification of “servants of God,” as being those who are in truths from the Lord (see n. 6, 409). In many passages in the Word the expression “praising God” signifies to confess him with the heart and with the lips, thus also to worship; “to praise God” has a similar signification as “hallelujah,” because “hallelujah” means “praise ye God,” and that means, as has been said before, the voice of joy and gladness in confessions of God and in the worship of God. “To praise God” signifies confession and worship, because the Lord has no wish to be praised and glorified from any love of himself, but only from his love for man, for man must needs praise and glorify the Lord, that is, give praise and glory to him, when he acknowledges in heart that there is nothing of good in himself, and that he can do nothing of himself, and on the other hand, that all good is from the Lord, and that the Lord can do all things. When man is in this acknowledgment he puts aside what is his own which belongs to the love of self, and opens all things of his mind, and thus gives room for the Divine to flow in with good and with power. This is why it is necessary for man to be in humiliation before the Lord, and why humiliation can be from no other source than self- acknowledgment and acknowledgment of the Lord, according to which reception is effected. That “to give praise to God” and “to praise God” mean to confess him and from confession of heart to worship him is evident from many passages in the Word (as Matt. 21:16; Luke 2:13–14, 20; 5:25–26; 7:16; 13:13; 18:43; 19:28–40; 24:52–53; also Psalm 148:1–5, 7, 13; and elsewhere.)

Such things exist also in heaven, because these forces are in the spiritual in things greatest and in things least, in its firsts and its ultimates, thus in the spiritual both in heaven and in the world. Its firsts are in the heavens, its ultimates are in the world. For there are degrees of spiritual things, and each degree is distinct from the other, and the prior or higher degree is more perfect than the posterior or lower. This is evident from the light and the heat in the heavens, and from the wisdom of the angels from these. The light in the highest or third heaven is from a flame so brilliant as to exceed a thousand times the midday light of the world; in the middle or second heaven the light is less bright, and yet exceeds a hundred times the noonday light of the world; in the lowest or first heaven the light is like the noonday light of our world. Also there are degrees of heat, which in heaven is love, and according to those degrees the angels have wisdom, intelligence, and knowledge. Everything spiritual belongs to the light and heat that are from the Lord as a sun, and wisdom and intelligence are from these. [3] There are also as many degrees of things spiritual below the heavens, that is, in nature, which are lower degrees of things spiritual, as can be seen from man’s natural mind, and from its rationality and sensuality; rational men are in its first degree, sensual men are in its last, and others are in the middle; and all thought and affection of the natural mind is spiritual. These three forces, namely, the active force, the creative force, and the formative force, are in the spiritual in every degree of it, but with a difference of perfection. But since there is nothing without its ultimate, in which it terminates and subsists, so the spiritual has its ultimate, which in the earth is in its lands and waters; and from this ultimate the spiritual produces plants of all kinds, from the tree to the blade of grass, and in these the spiritual abides, manifesting itself only in a certain likeness to animals that has been spoken of above. 1211.

In the heavens, as on the earth, there are plants of all genera and species; yea, in the heavens there are also plants that are not on the earth, for there are composite forms of the different genera and species with infinite variation. This they derive from their origin, of which below. The genera and species of the plants differ in the heavens as the genera and species of animals do, of which above. [3] According to the degrees of light and heat there, paradisal gardens, groves, fields, and plains are seen; and in these, groups of trees and flowers and lawns. In the inmost or third heaven especially there are orchards whose fruits drop oils; beds of flowers from which fragrant odors are spread abroad, and the seeds of which are sweet to the taste from the fragrance and the oil; and there are lawns diffusing like odors. In the middle or second heaven there are orchards whose fruits drop wine; and flower beds from which exhale pleasant odors, with seeds of delicate flavor, and also lawns. In the lowest or first heaven there are the same things as in the inmost and in the middle heaven, with a difference of delights and pleasantnesses according to degrees. [4] Moreover, in the inmost heaven there are fruits and seeds of pure gold, in the middle heaven of silver, and in the lowest heaven of copper; there are also flowers of precious stones and of crystals. All these germinate from the lands there. There are lands there, as with us; but nothing springs up from seed sown, but only from seed created; and creation there is instantaneous, sometimes enduring for a long time and sometimes only for a moment; for they exist there by means of the forces of light and heat from the sun of heaven, which is the Lord, and apart from the forces that serve as substitutes and aids from the light and heat from the sun of the world.

There all things are spiritual with a natural appearance; but in the lands that are subject to the sun of our world it is not so. These things have been mentioned to show that in everything spiritual, both in heaven and in the world, and both in the firsts and in the ultimates, there are these three forces, namely, the active force, the creative force, and the formative force; and that these forces proceed continually to their ultimates, in which they close and subsist; and for this reason there are lands also in the heavens, for the lands there are these forces in ultimates. There is this difference, that the lands there are spiritual from their origin, but here they are natural; and the productions from our lands are effected from the spiritual by means of nature, but in those lands without nature. 1212. Both the small and the great signifies all who are in truths and goods in every degree. This is evident from the signification of “the small,” as being those who are but little in truths and goods; and from the signification of “the great,” as being those who are much in them. What is further signified by “the small” and “the great” may be seen above (n. 696a, 836).

It has been shown above that the origin of animals, which also is their soul, is spiritual affection, such as man has in his natural. That plants have the same origin is evident especially from plants in the heavens, in their appearing according to the affections of angels, and representing those affections, even so that the angels see and recognize their affections in them as in their types; also that they are changed as the affections change; but this occurs outside of the societies. The only difference is that affections appear formed into animals by the spiritual in its intermediate parts, while they appear formed into plants in its ultimates, which are the lands there.

In ultimates the spiritual retains no more of life than is sufficient to produce a resemblance of being alive. It is nearly the same as in the human body, the ultimates of which, that are produced by the spiritual, are cartilages, bones, teeth, and nails, and in these what is living, which is from the soul, terminates. [3] That the plant soul has the same origin as the soul of the beasts of the earth and of the birds of heaven and of the fishes of the sea does not appear to be true at first sight, for the reason that the one is a living thing and the other is not; nevertheless it becomes plainly evident from the animals and the plants seen in the heavens, and also from those seen in the hells. In the heavens beautiful animals and like plants are seen; but in the hells noxious animals and like plants; and angels and spirits are known from the way the animals appear, and equally from the way the plants appear. The agreement with the affections of the angels and spirits is so complete that an animal can be changed into a corresponding plant, and a plant into a corresponding animal. [4] The angels of heaven know what element of affection is represented in the one and in the other; and I have heard, and even perceived, that it is the same. Moreover, it has been granted me to discern clearly the correspondence of both animals and of plants with the societies of heaven and with the societies of hell, thus with their affections, for in the spiritual world societies and affections make one. This is why in so many places in the Word gardens, groves, forests, trees, and plants of various kinds, are mentioned, and why they have there a spiritual signification according to their origins, all of which have reference to affections. [5] The difference, therefore, between the plants in the spiritual world and those in the natural world is that in the spiritual world both their seeds and their germinations exist in an instant according to the affections of the angels and spirits there; but in the natural world the origin is implanted in the seeds, from which they spring each year. Moreover, there are two things proper to nature, time and consequent succession and space and consequent"

But this occurs only when the angels go away; as long as they remain the plants continue. This is the difference between plants in the spiritual world and plants in the natural world. 1213. Verses 6–7. And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as it were the voice of many waters, and as it were the voice of mighty thunders, saying, Alleluia, for the Lord God, the almighty, reigneth. Let us rejoice and exult, and let us give the glory unto him, for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready. 6. “And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude,” signifies the glorification of the Lord by all that are in the heavens because of the rejection of the evil and the consequent deliverance of the good (n. 1214); “and as it were the voice of many waters” signifies the glorification of him from truths (n. 1215); “and as it were the voice of mighty thunders,” signifies the glorification of him from the goods of love (n. 1216); “saying, Alleluia, for the Lord God, the almighty, reigneth,” signifies joy and gladness that the Lord has now a kingdom on the earth as in the heavens (n. 1217). 7. “Let us rejoice and exult, and let us give the glory unto him,” signifies manifestation of joy from the affection of truth and from the affection of good (n. 1218); “for the marriage of the Lamb is come,” signifies the conjunction of the Lord with the church (n. 1219); “and his wife hath made herself ready,” signifies that the church is now adorned with truths from good for receiving him (n. 1220). 1214. Verse 6. And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, signifies the glorification of the Lord by all that are in the heavens because of the rejection of the evil and the consequent deliverance of the good. This is evident from the signification of a “voice,” as being the glorification of the Lord, for the voice was “Alleluia, for the Lord God, the almighty, reigneth,” as appears from the end of this verse. That it is glorification because of the rejection of the evil and thence the deliverance of the good is a consequence from what precedes and follows in this chapter and in other chapters, for it"

It is evident also from the signification of “a great multitude,” as being all that are in the heavens, who are called a “multitude” from the combined sound of all. Simultaneous speech by many is heard as “the voice of a great multitude.” (Continuation) [2] (7) That origin is use. This is because affections have reference to uses; use is the subject of all affection, for man cannot be affected except for the sake of something, and that something is use. Since, then, all affection supposes use, and the plant soul, from its spiritual origin, is an affection, as has been said, it, too, is a use. For this very reason every plant contains a use, a spiritual use in the spiritual world, and both a spiritual and a natural use in the natural world. The spiritual use is for the various states of the mind, and the natural use is for the various states of the body. It is well known that minds are refreshed, recreated, and stimulated, or on the other hand that drowsiness, sadness, or fainting is induced, by the odors and flavors of different kinds of plants; also that the body is healed by the various solutions, purgations, and remedies made from plants, and on the other hand, is destroyed by the poisons extracted from them. [3] In the heavens the external spiritual use derived from them is the refreshment of minds, and the internal is the representation of Divine things in them, and thereby also the elevation of the mind. For the wiser angels see in them the quality of affections in a series. These, with what lies hidden in them, are manifested in the varieties of flowers in their order, also in the variegations of color and odor. For every ultimate affection which is called natural, although it is spiritual, derives its quality from an interior affection, which pertains to intelligence and wisdom, and these derive their quality from use and the love of it. In a word, from the soil in the heavens nothing but use blooms forth, for use is the plant soul."

Every good in act that is from the Lord through love to him and love towards the neighbor, is meant by the uses that alone blossom forth in the heavens. Every plant there represents a form of use; and whatever appears in it, from its first to its last and from its last to its first, that is, from seed to flower and from flower to seed, exhibits the progression or extension from end to end of an affection and of its use. Those that are skilled in the sciences of botany, chemistry, medicine, and pharmacy, come after death into a knowledge of spiritual uses from the plants in the spiritual world, and cultivate that knowledge and find the greatest delight in it. I have talked with such and have heard from them wonderful things. 1215. And as it were the voice of many waters, signifies the glorification of him from truths. This is evident from the signification of a “voice,” as being the glorification of the Lord (as above); also from the signification of “waters,” as being truths (see n. 71, 483a, b, 518a–d, 537a, 538a, b, 854, 971, 1033); therefore “many waters” mean all the truths that are with the angels in the heavens. In the heavens there are angels that are in truths and angels that are in goods. The angels that are in truths are called spiritual angels, and those that are in goods are called celestial angels. From this heaven is divided into two kingdoms, the spiritual and the celestial kingdoms. In the spiritual kingdom are all that are in truths, and in the celestial kingdom are all that are in goods. [2] All, indeed, are in truths from good; but good is twofold, spiritual good and celestial good; the good of charity is the good of love towards the neighbor, and celestial good is the good of love to the Lord. These goods are distinct; spiritual good is good in a lower degree, and celestial good is good in a higher degree; consequently the good that the angels of the higher heavens have is celestial good, while the good that the angels of the lower heavens have is spiritual good."

(Continuation) [3] From all that has thus far been presented respecting the life that is from the Lord and the existence of all things in the universe from it, everyone who is wise in heart can see that nature produces nothing from itself, but merely in the process of production serves the spiritual that proceeds from the sun of heaven, which is the Lord, as an instrumental cause serves its principal cause, or as a dead force serves its living force. This makes clear how mistaken those are who ascribe the generations of animals and the productions of plants to nature. This is the same as ascribing magnificent and splendid works to the tool and not to the workman, or like adoring a sculptured image and not God. [4] From this spring the fallacies, which are innumerable, in all reasonings about spiritual, moral, and civil matters; for a fallacy is an inversion of order; it is the judgment of the eye, not of the mind; it is a conclusion from the appearance of a thing, not from its essence. Consequently to reason from fallacies respecting the world and the existence of things in it is like confirming by reasonings that thick darkness is light, that what is dead is alive, and that the body flows into the soul, and not the reverse. And yet it is an eternal truth that influx is spiritual and not physical, that is, influx from the soul, which is spiritual, into the body, which is material, or from the spiritual world into the natural world; also that as the Divine from itself and through that which proceeds from itself created all things, so it sustains all things; also that sustaining is perpetual creation, as subsistence is perpetual existence. 1216.

In the speech of man two things unite, namely, sound and its articulation into words. The sound belongs to the affection of man’s will, and the articulation of the sound belongs to the thought of his understanding. These two unite in human speech, but are distinguished by the hearing. For the affection is known from the sound, and the thought from the words, which are articulations of the sound. This is so natural a thing that man gives little thought to it; but he knows it to be true when he hears it. This distinction is more clearly perceived by angels and spirits than by men, because they are spiritual, and the spiritual think from affection and also speak from affection, those who are in the celestial kingdom from the affection of good, and those in the spiritual kingdom from the affection of truth; thus they are distinguished by their tones. The sound of the speech of the angels in the higher parts of heaven is heard variously below, for it increases as it goes on, as sound does in the world when it descends from above. The sound of the spiritual angels is thus heard as the sound of roaring waters, and the sound of the celestial angels as the sound of thunders.

In every religion it is acknowledged that God is omnipresent and omniscient; therefore prayer is offered to God that he will hear and that he will see and will have mercy; which would not be done unless his omnipresence and omniscience were believed in.

In order, therefore, that the things relating to God may be seen, it is permitted to treat of them from light and from consequent rational sight. [3] For every man, even a merely natural and sensual man, is endowed with an understanding that can be raised up into the light of heaven, and can see spiritual things, and even Divine things, and can comprehend them, but only while he is hearing them or reading about them; and afterwards he can talk about them from the memory, but cannot think about them within himself from himself. The reason of this is that when he is listening or reading, the understanding is separated from its own affection, and when so separated it is in the light of heaven, but when he is thinking within himself from himself the understanding is joined to the affection of his will, and that affection fills the understanding and occupies it, and hinders it from going out of itself. Nevertheless, the fact is that the understanding can be separated from the affection of the will, and thus can be raised up into the light of heaven with such natural men as have any affection of truth and as have not confirmed themselves in falsities; but scarcely with those that have no affection of truth from having rejected all Divine things or from having confirmed themselves in falsities. In such, between spiritual light and natural light there is a sort of darkening veil, although with many this is transparent. [4] Since, then, any man, even a corporeal sensual man, when he reaches adult age is endowed with such an ability to understand that he can comprehend the things that relate to God when he is listening or reading, and afterwards can retain them in his memory, and thus talk, teach, and write about them, it is important that this treatise on the Divine attributes should be continued as it was begun.

This is evident from the signification of “Alleluia,” as being an expression of glorification of the Lord from joy of heart (see n. 1197, 1203). The two expressions, joy and gladness, are used because in the Word “joy” is predicated of good, and “gladness” of truth, and here both the angels that were in truths and those that were in goods said “Alleluia.” It is evident also from the signification of “the Lord God, the almighty, reigneth” as being that his kingdom is on the earth as in the heavens, which means that when the good have been separated from the evil, and the evil have been cast into hell, all the good came into a better state for receiving truth and good from the Lord, a state in which they had not been before. For so long as they were held in connection with the evil, if they had received goods and truths they would have defiled and perverted them. For the same reason interior truths were not revealed on the earth until that separation had been effected by means of the last judgment. [2] This, too, is the meaning of the words in the Lord’s prayer: Thy kingdom come on earth as in the heavens (Matt. 6:10). The Lord’s kingdom existed before the last judgment, for the Lord always rules both heaven and earth; but after the last judgment the state of the Lord’s kingdom became different from the state before it, for after it the reception of Divine truth and good became more universal, more interior, more easy, and more distinct. It is said, “the Lord God, the almighty,” for the Lord is called “Lord” from good, and “God” from truth, “almighty” from the separation of the good from the evil by the last judgment, and also from his power to save those who receive him."

It is only from the things by which he is moved or which he loves that man has joy. There are two universal origins of all spiritual joys, one is from the affection or love of truth, the other from the affection or love of good. Joy from the affection of good belongs properly to the will and to deeds therefrom, while joy from the affection of truth belongs properly to the understanding and to speech therefrom. As the preceding verse treats of those who are in truths and of those who are in goods, and also of the glorification of the Lord by them, so the joy of all such and glorification by such is expressed in these words, “Let us rejoice and exult, and give glory unto him.” (Continuation) [2] (1)In the natural world there are spaces and times, but in the spiritual world these are appearances.

Pure love, from which all things in the spiritual world exist immediately, is immaterial; but pure fire, through which all things in the material world exist mediately, is material. This is why all things that come forth in the spiritual world are by virtue of their origin spiritual, and all things that exist in the natural world are by virtue of their secondary origin material; and material things in themselves are fixed, permanent, and measurable. They are fixed because they endure, however the states of men may be changed, like the lands, mountains, and seas. They are permanent, because they recur regularly in turn, like the seasons, generations, and germinations. And they are measurable, because all things can be defined, as spaces by miles and furlongs, and these by feet and spans, and as times by days, weeks, months, and years.

For they exist and continue according to the states of the angels, so that they make one with those states, and consequently they change in whatever way those states change. But this takes place especially in the world of spirits, into which every man first comes after death, and is not so in heaven or in hell. This occurs in the world of spirits, because every man there undergoes changes of state, and is thus prepared for heaven or for hell. [3] But spirits do not reflect upon these changes and variations, because they are spiritual and are thus in spiritual thought, and with this each and all things that they perceive by sense make one; also because they are separated from nature, and yet they see in the spiritual world things exactly like those they saw in the world, as lands, mountains, valleys, waters, gardens, forests, plants, palaces, houses, garments with which they are clothed, food by which they are nourished, animals, and themselves as men. All these things they see in a clearer light than that by which they saw like things in the world, and they feel them by a more exquisite touch than they had in the world. For these reasons man after death is wholly ignorant that he has put off his material part, and that he has emigrated from the world of his body into the world of his spirit. I have heard many declaring that they have not died, and that they could not understand how anything of their body could have been rejected in the grave; and for the reason that all things in that world are like those in this world; and they do not know that the things they there see and feel are not material, but are substantial from a spiritual origin, and yet are real things, since they have the same origin that all things in this world have, with this difference only, that something additional like an outer garment has been added from the sun of the world to those things that are in the natural world by virtue of which they have become material, fixed, permanent, and measurable.

For the marriage of the Lamb is come, signifies conjunction of the Lord with the church. This is evident from the signification of “marriage,” as being conjunction (of which presently); also from the signification of “the Lamb,” as being the Lord as to the Divine human (see n. 314). It is said “the marriage of the Lamb,” because the conjunction of the Lord with the church is the conjunction of his Divine human with it; for there can be no immediate conjunction with his Divine which is called the Father, since this cannot be received, for it is above every idea of the thought of men and of angels; not so with the Divine human, for one can think of this. This is why it is said “the marriage of the Lamb,” and not “the marriage of the Lord God.” (Continuation) [2] As there are like things in heaven and in our world, in the heavens there are spaces and times, but the spaces there, like the lands themselves and the things upon them, are appearances; for they appear according to the states of the angels, and the extensions of spaces and distances appear according to the similarities and dissimilarities of states. By states are meant states of love and wisdom, or of affections and of thoughts therefrom, which are manifold and various. According to these the angelic societies in the heavens are distant from each other, also the heavens are distant from the hells, and the societies of the hells from each other. It has been granted me to see how likeness of state conjoins, and lessens the extension of space or distance, and how unlikeness of state separates, and produces extension of space or distance. Those there who appear to be a mile apart can instantly be present with each other when the love of one for the other is stirred up, and on the other hand those who are talking together can instantly become a mile apart when anything of hatred is aroused."

And yet spaces in the heavens appear extended in the same way as the spaces of our earth. But as the spaces there have only a spiritual origin, and not at the same time a natural origin, and thus appear according to the states of the angels, so the angels can have no idea of spaces, but they have instead an idea of their states; for the changeableness of the spaces gives rise to the idea that they are from a spiritual origin, thus from a likeness or unlikeness of affections and of thoughts therefrom. [4] It is the same in regard to times, for as spaces are, so are times, since progressions through spaces are also progressions through times. Times also are appearances of states because the sun of heaven, which is the Lord, does not there make days and years by its revolutions and progressions, as the sun of the world seems to do; consequently in the heavens there is perpetual light and a perpetual spring, and therefore times there are not fixed, permanent, and measurable. And as times also vary according to the states of the affections and of the thoughts therefrom, for they are short or diminished by things delightful to the affections, and are long or lengthened by things undelightful to the affections, so the angels cannot have from appearance an idea of time, but they have instead an idea of states from its origin. All this makes clear that the angels in heaven have no idea of space and time, but they have a spiritual idea about these, which is an idea of state. [5] But this idea of state with the consequent idea of the appearance of space and time comes solely in and from the ultimates of creation there; the ultimates of creation there are the lands upon which angels dwell. It is there that spaces and times appear, and not in the spiritual things themselves by which the ultimates were created; nor do they appear in the affections themselves of angels, except when the thought from them extends to ultimates.

This is evident from the signification of “wife,” in reference to the Lord as being the church (see n. 1120); also from the signification of “making herself ready,” as being to be adorned with truths from good for receiving him, for it is added that “she should be clothed in fine linen, clean and bright,” and “fine linen” signifies truth from celestial good. The church receives the Lord by these truths, for the Lord flows in with man into the good of his love, and is received by man in truths, and from this is all spiritual conjunction. The expression “to be adorned” is used, which means to be taught and to learn, for thus and no otherwise does the church adorn herself and make herself ready for the marriage and for receiving the Lord.

All materialism arises from thinking about Divine things in accord with what is proper to nature, that is, matter, space, and time. The mind that clings to these, and is unwilling to believe anything that it does not understand, cannot do otherwise than make blind its understanding, and from the dense darkness in which it is immersed, deny that there is any Divine providence, and thus deny the Divine omnipotence, omnipresence, and omniscience, although these are just what religion teaches both within nature and above nature. And yet these cannot be comprehended by the understanding unless spaces and times are separated from the ideas of its thought; for these are in some way present in every idea of thought, and unless they are separated man cannot think otherwise than that nature is everything, that it is from itself, and consequently that the inmost of nature is what is called God, and that all beyond it is merely ideal. And such, I know, will wonder how anything can possibly exist where there is no time or space; and that the Divine itself is without them, and that the spiritual are not in them, but are only in appearances of them; and yet Divine spiritual things are the very essence of all things that have existed or that exist, and natural things apart from these are like bodies without souls, which become carcasses.

All truth is from good, and there are two most general goods, from which are all truths, namely, celestial good, which is the good of love to the Lord, and spiritual good, which is the good of love towards the neighbor. Truth from this good is meant by “bright fine linen,” and truth from the former good is meant by “clean fine linen,” both from the Word; for the Word in all its particulars is such that truth from celestial good and truth from spiritual good are conjoined, and within these truths celestial good is conjoined with spiritual good. (Continuation) [2] All the angels of heaven and all the men on the earth who constitute the church are as one man, and the Lord is the life of that man. This you will see confirmed in Heaven and Hell in the following articles: the whole heaven in the complex has relation to one man (n. 59–67); each society in the heavens has relation to one man (n. 68–72); consequently each angel is in a perfect human form (n. 73–77); heaven as a whole and in part has relation to man, and this is from the Lord’s Divine human (n. 78–86); there is a correspondence of all things of heaven with all things of man (n. 87–102). The same may be said of the Lord’s church on the earth (n. 57). That heaven is like one man I have been taught by experience and am taught by reason. Experience: It has been granted me to behold a society consisting of thousands of angels as one man of a medium stature, and societies consisting of fewer angels in like form. This is seen, however, not by the angels in that society, but by angels outside of that society at a distance, and at the time when a society is to be purified of those who are foreign to it. When this is done all who constitute the life of that society are within that man, while those who do not are outside of him; and these are removed, but the former remain. It is the same with the whole heaven in the presence of the Lord. For this reason and no other every angel and spirit is a man, in a form like that which a man on earth has."

Moreover, not only does the church on earth together with the angels constitute the interiors of that man, the church constitutes also the exteriors, which are called the cartilaginous and bony parts; this the church constitutes, because the men of the earth are provided with a body in which the lowest spiritual is clothed with the natural. This is what constitutes the conjunction of heaven with the church and of the church with heaven. [4] From reason: heaven and the church are a man, in the greatest, the lesser, and the least sum or complex, for the sole reason that God is man, and consequently the Divine proceeding, which is the Divine from him, is the same in every least and greatest respect, which is man. For it has been said above that the Divine is not in space and extension, but causes spaces and extensions to exist in the ultimates of his creation, in the heavens apparently, in the world actually. Nevertheless spaces and extensions are not spaces and extensions before God, for he is in his Divine everywhere. This is clearly manifest from this, that the whole angelic heaven with the church is as one man before God; and so is a society consisting of thousands of angels, although their habitations appear extended through much space. The same is evident also from this, that the whole heaven, also an entire society in heaven, can appear at the good pleasure of the Lord, as a man, great or small, as a giant or as an infant. But it is not the angels that so appear, but the Divine in them; for the angels are only recipients of the Divine from the Lord, and it is the Divine in them that constitutes what is angelic in them and thus heaven. As angels are only recipients, and the Divine in them constitutes what is angelic and heaven, it is clear that the Lord is the life of that man, that is, of heaven and the church."

That life is in the most particular things of man is evident from the fact, that from his life he sees, hears, smells, and tastes, which could not be unless the organs of those senses lived from the life of his soul; also from the fact that the whole surface of the body possesses the sense of touch, and it is the life that produces that sense, and not the skin apart from the life. This is evident also from the fact that all the muscles under the skin are under the control of the life of man’s will and understanding, and are moved at their pleasure, thus not only the hands and feet and the entire body, but also the tongue, the lips, the face, and the entire head. None of these could be moved by the body alone, but they are moved by life from the will and understanding together with the life in these members. The same is true of all the viscera in the body, each of which performs its own office, and acts submissively according to the laws of order inscribed on it. But it is the life that does this by its motion from the heart and lungs in every part, and by sensation from the cerebellum in every part, while man is unconscious of its action."

Therefore from the ultimates that it has created it joins to itself things proper to the existence of man in whom life can live. From this it is clear that life is in the particular and most particular things of man, and that any part or least particle from which life is absent becomes dead and is dissociated. Since, then, men and angels are not lives, but only recipients of life from the Lord, and since the whole heaven with the church is before the Lord as one man, it is clear that the Lord is the life of that man, that is, of heaven and the church, and also that he is omnipresent and omniscient in the particular and most particular things of the angels of heaven and the men of the church.

By these two higher degrees man is a man; these are closed with the evil, but with the good are open. And yet, in regard to the light of heaven, which is the wisdom that proceeds from the Lord as a sun, these two degrees are not closed with the evil, but are closed in regard to the heat, which is the love, that at the same time proceeds therefrom. From this it is that every man, even an evil man, has a capacity to understand, but not a capacity to will from heavenly love, for the will is a receptacle of heat, that is, of love, and the understanding is a receptacle of light, that is, of wisdom, from that sun. [3] The reason why every man is not intelligent and wise is that some have by their lives closed up in themselves the receptacle of that love, and when that is closed they have no wish to understand anything except what they love, for that only do they wish and love to think about and thus understand. And as every man, even an evil man, has an ability to understand, and that ability is from an influx of light from the sun which is the Lord, it is clear that the Lord is also present with those who are out of heaven and the church, who are either in hell or are to come into hell. It is from the same ability that man is able to think and reason about various things, which beasts cannot do. It is from the same ability that man lives forever.

The angels, moreover, in accordance with their uses have houses given them, full of utensils and beautiful things according to uses; also garments according to their uses, and food that is esculent and palatable according to their uses, and delightful conversations, which also are uses because they are recreations. All these things are given them gratuitously, and yet on account of the uses they perform. In a word, the whole heaven is so full of uses that it may be called the very kingdom of uses.

The greater forms, which are called members, sensories, muscles, and viscera, which are made up and organized from fibers and vessels, all are formed from use, in use, and for use, so that they may be simply called uses, of which the whole man is composed and formed. It is therefore clearly evident that they have no other origin and no other end than use. [6] That every man likewise was created and born for use is clearly evident from the use of all things in him, and from his state after death, when, if he performs no use, he is accounted so worthless that he is cast into infernal prisons or into desert places. That man is born to be a use is clear also from his life; for a man whose life is from a love of uses is wholly different from one whose life is from a love of idleness. By a life of idleness is meant a life made up of social interaction feasting, and entertainments. A life from the love of uses is a life of love of the public good and of love to the neighbor, and also a life of love to the Lord, for the Lord performs uses to man through man, consequently a life of the love of uses is the spiritual Divine life, and everyone who loves a"

But a life of the love of idleness is a life of the love of self and the world, and thus a merely natural life; and such a life does not hold the thoughts together, but diffuses them into every vain thing, and thereby turns man away from the delights of wisdom and immerses him in the delights of the body and of the world alone to which evils cling; therefore after death he is let down into the infernal society to which he has attached himself in the world, and is there compelled to work by force of hunger and lack of food. By uses in the heavens and on the earths are meant the ministries, functions, and pursuits of life, employments, various domestic tasks, occupations, consequently all things that are opposite to idleness and indolence. [7] From the essence of uses: the essence of uses is the public good. With the angels the public good in the most general sense means the good of the entire heaven, in a less general sense the good of the society, and in a particular sense the good of the fellow citizen. But with men the essence of uses in the most general sense is both the spiritual and the civil good of the whole human race, in a less general sense the good of the country, in a particular sense the good of a society, and in an individual sense the good of the fellow citizen; and as these goods constitute the essence of uses, love is their life, since all good is of love and the life is in the love. In this love is everyone who takes delight in the use he is in because of its usefulness, whether he is a king, a magistrate, a priest, a minister, a general, a merchant, or a workman. Everyone who takes delight in the use of his function because of its usefulness loves his country and fellow citizens; but he who does not take delight in it because of its usefulness, but does it solely for the sake of self, or solely for the sake of honor and wealth, does not in his heart love his country and fellow citizens, but only himself and the world. This is because no one can be kept by the Lord in love to the neighbor unless he is in some love for the public good; and no one can be in that love unless he is in the love of use for the sake of use, or in the love of use from use, thus from the Lord."

And from all this the Lord’s omnipresence and omniscience can be comprehended. 1227. Verse 10. And I fell down before his feet to adore him; and he said unto me, See thou do it not, I am thy fellow servant and of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus; adore God, for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy. 10. “And I fell down before his feet to adore him” signifies perception from him of the Divine to which adoration belongs (n. 1228); “and he said unto me, See thou do it not,” signifies the knowledge that he was not God but an angel (n. 1229); “I am thy fellow servant and of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus” signifies that he is like men on the earth who receive or have received the Divine truth from the Lord (n. 1230); “adore God” signifies that the Lord alone is to be acknowledged and worshiped from the heart (n. 1231); “for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy” signifies that acknowledgment of the Lord and conjunction with him is the life of all doctrine from the Word (n. 1232). 1228. Verse 10. And I fell down before his feet to adore him signifies perception from him of the Divine, to which adoration belongs. This is evident from the signification of “to fall down before the feet” and “to adore,” as being to acknowledge, confess, and worship the Divine (see n. 805a, 821a, 1206). From his saying that he must not be adored because he is only an angel, who is a servant of the Lord the same as men are, it is evident that merely a perception from him of the Divine is meant. But the essence of the matter is that when the Lord sends angels to men, as he did to the prophets, he fills them with his Divine and thus moves them to speak. Then the angel that is sent speaks from the Lord and not"

Thus the Word was written by the Lord by means of angels, and thus the Lord spoke with the ancients, as with Abraham, with Hagar his handmaid, with Gideon, and in general with the prophets, and this is why the prophets called the angels Jehovah, and some of them were adored as long as they were filled with the Divine. This presence of the Lord is the same as the presence of the Holy Spirit. This makes clear what is signified by these words. (Continuation) [2] (8) As the Lord has the Divine love and the Divine wisdom, so from these he has Divine omnipresence and Divine omniscience, but omnipresence is chiefly from the Divine love, and omniscience is chiefly from the Divine wisdom. Love and wisdom in the Lord are not two but one, and this one is the Divine love, which appears before the angels of heaven as a sun. But when love and wisdom proceed from the Lord as a sun they appear as two distinct things, love appearing as heat, and wisdom as light. These from their origin from the sun act wholly as one; but with the angels of heaven and with the men of the church they are separated, some receiving more of love which is heat than of wisdom which is light, and these are called celestial angels and men; while others receive more of wisdom which is light than of love which is heat, and these are called spiritual angels and men. An illustration of this can be found in the sun of the world. In that sun fire and the origin of light are wholly one, and this one is the fiery element in that sun. From this the heat and light proceed together, but they appear as two distinct things, although from their origin they act as one. That one appears on the earth in the spring and summer seasons, yet they are two distinct things according to the turning of the earth towards the sun, and thus according as the reception is direct or oblique. This correspondence may serve as an illustration. [3] It is similar with omnipresence and omniscience. In the Lord these are one; and yet they proceed from him as two distinct attributes; for omnipresence has relation to love, and omniscience"

(3) Life, which is love, is not given except in a form, and that form is a form of uses in the whole complex. (4) Such a form is man, individually and collectively, and in such a form is heaven, and also the world. (5) There are genera and species of uses, and varieties of species to infinity; also there are degrees of uses. (6) There are as many affections as there are uses, and consequently there are genera and species of affections, and differences of species to infinity; and there are degrees of affections. (7) Every affection of use in itself is a man, according to its quality and quantity. (8) Each use draws its life from the common good, and flows in from it, and gives the necessary, useful, and delightful things of life.

That this is little comprehended is evident from the common saying “What is love?” What it is, is not known for the reason that love is not manifest to the understanding, and the understanding is the receptacle of the light of heaven. What comes into that light is interiorly seen, for what a man thinks, that he has knowledge of. For this reason a man says that this or that is in the light of his understanding, also that he sees this to be so; likewise he prays that he may be enlightened and illumined by God. Moreover, there is spiritual light to which natural light corresponds, and it is from this that one says, with reference to his understanding, that he sees, and a wise man prays to be enlightened and to be illumined by God, that is, that he may understand. Man, therefore, can form no idea concerning love, for this reason, that although the understanding by means of the thought presents itself to be seen, love does not. And yet love is the very soul or life of thought, and if love be taken away thought grows cold and dies, like a flower deprived of heat; for love enkindles, vivifies, and animates thought. Set your mind at work and consider whether you can think apart from some affection that is of love; and you will find in your own case that it is impossible. From this it is plain that love is the life of the understanding and of thought therefrom; and what is the life of the understanding and of thought therefrom is also the life of the whole man; for it is the life of all the senses and of all motions, thus the life of the organs by means of which senses and motions exist. That it is also the life of the rest of the viscera, will be seen in what follows. 2. It is not known what love is, for the further reason that man’s love is universal life.

Such also is the universal Divine in the most minute particulars of the world; consequently this Divine is so obscure to man as not to be manifest to the eye when opened, but only to the eye when closed; for the whole of the world is a work of the Divine love and the Divine wisdom; and wisdom in its most minute particulars is, as was said before, an intense Divine light that blinds. 2 The Lord alone is love itself, because life itself, while men and angels are only recipients 3. This has already been illustrated by many things, to which the following only are to be added. The Lord, because he is the God of the universe, is uncreate and infinite, but men and angels are created and finite. The uncreate and infinite is the very Divine in itself. Out of this man cannot be formed, for in such case he would be the Divine in itself; but he can be formed out of things created and finite, in which the Divine can be, and to which it can communicate its own life, and this by heat and light from itself as a sun, thus from its own Divine love; comparatively as it is with germinations in the earth, which cannot be formed from the very essence of the sun of the world, but must needs be formed out of created things of which soil is composed, within which the sun can be by its heat and light, and to which it can communicate its life. From this it is plain that a man and an angel are not in themselves life, but are only recipients of life. 4.

The Divine love, which is life itself, is not simply love, but it is the proceeding Divine; and the proceeding Divine is the Lord himself. The Lord is indeed in the sun which appears to angels in the heavens, and from which proceed love as heat and wisdom as light; yet outside of that sun, love with wisdom is also the Lord. The distance is only an appearance; for the Divine is not in space, but is without distance, as was said above. There is an appearance of distance because the Divine love, such as it is in the Lord, cannot be received by any angel, for it would consume them; for in itself it is hotter than the fire in the sun of the world; for this reason it is lessened gradually by infinite circumvolutions, until, tempered and accommodated, it reaches the angels, who moreover, are veiled with a thin cloud lest they should be injured by its intensity. This is the cause of the appearance as of distance between the Lord as a sun, and heaven where angels are; nevertheless, the Lord himself is present in heaven, but in a way suited to reception. 6. The Lord’s presence is not like the presence of a man who occupies space, but it is a presence apart from space; that is, he is in things greatest and least, so that in things greatest he is himself, and in things least is himself. It is difficult, I know, for man to comprehend this, because it is difficult for him to remove space from the ideas of his thought; but it can be comprehended by angels, in whose ideas there are no spaces. In this respect spiritual thought differs from natural thought."

But how the Divine proceeding, which is the very and only life, can be in things created and finite, shall now be told. This life applies itself not to man, but only to uses in man. Uses themselves, viewed in themselves, are spiritual; while the forms of use, which are members, organs, and viscera, are natural. But yet these are series of uses; to such an extent that there cannot be a particle, or the least of any particle, in any member, organ, or viscus, that is not a use in form.

In illustration of this subject it will be sufficient to survey with the eye of reason the structure of the lungs and of the trachea, and to consider their uses. 12. In regard to the lungs. Their most general use is respiration, which is effected by admitting air through the larynx, the trachea, the bronchia and their ramifications, into the vesicles of the lobules, whereby the lungs alternately expand and contract. In doing this they induce reciprocal motions in the whole organic body and in all its members; for the heart and lungs are the two fountains of all the general motions throughout the body, whereby the parts of the body, one and all, are led into their own activities and vital functions. They also consociate the voluntary motor life, which is dependent upon the cerebrum, with the natural motor life, which is controlled by the cerebellum. It is also their use to give such disposition to all the viscera of the body, and especially to its motors called muscles, that the will may carry out its movements harmoniously, and without break in any part. Their use also is both to act concurrently with all the tones of speech and of song, and also to produce them as from a womb. Another use is to receive within themselves all the blood of the body from the right side of the heart, to purify it from all that is viscid and unclean, and to cast out these impurities; also to supply it from the inhaled air with new elements that serve as food, and to send it back as if made new into the left chamber of the heart; thus their use consists in converting venous blood into arterial. And so the lungs are of service to the blood as a place for the offices of straining, cleansing, refreshing and preparing it; also as a place for purifying the air. In addition to these uses of the lungs, there are many others, both general and particular; and every pore and every little lobe therein is a partner in all the offices, that is, uses; some more closely and some more remotely."

Its uses are: (1) To afford a channel for the auras and breath of the lungs, to pass and re-pass; and to accommodate itself to each and every different mode of action of the lungs, both in inspiration and expiration. (2) To examine and cleanse the air about to pass into the lungs, that nothing hurtful may enter; and to impregnate with vapors the air as it passes out, thus attracting effete exhalations, and expelling them; also in general to clear the lungs of viscid phlegm by expectoration. (3) To serve as a pillar and support to the larynx and the epiglottis; to adapt itself entirely to all their commands and tremulous vibrations; to dispose the walls of its canal so that the air may impinge upon them, and to make tense its membrane, so that when the air impinges, the membrane may tremble; and thus, in a rudimentary way, to excite sound which the larynx and the glottis may form, that is, may modulate, into singing or speech; also to moisten the larynx continually with a vapory dew. (4) To aid and assist its neighbor, the esophagus, in its office of swallowing. (5) To extend the alternate respiratory movements of the lungs to the neighboring parts, and by means of these to parts more and more remote; namely, to the esophagus, and by this, in connection with the diaphragm, to the stomach, and so to the abdominal viscera; also to the ascending carotid artery and the descending jugular vein, and to the great sympathetic nerves —the intercostal and the par vagum; thus establishing the motor life of the body. (6) To insinuate into the neighboring parts, and through these into parts highest and lowest, its own sonorous vibrations and those of the larynx; and to excite the arterial blood mounting to the head and the brain, and the venous blood returning from the head and the brain, and to exhilarate and animate them by a general modification; thus establishing the sensual life of the body.1 14. Moreover, from the bones that are in relation with the trachea, and at the same time from those belonging to the larynx and epiglottis, which are not here enumerated, a mind endowed with understanding, and cultivated by the sciences, with anatomy as a teacher and the eye as a guide, may be taught and may know how nature modulates sounds, and determines their relations in articulation."

There are like arcana in all the other viscera, both of the head and of the body, and still more in those that lie inwardly concealed and cannot be examined by any eye; for the more interior a thing is, the more perfect it is. In a word, the preeminent life, or excellency of life, in every member, organ, and viscus, consists in this—that whatever is proper to anyone is common to all; and thus in every particular thing there is an idea of the whole man. 16. It is this arcanum that will now be stated as a conclusion: man is the complex of all uses; of all that are possible both in the spiritual world and in the natural world; and every use, from the idea of the universe in it, is like a man, but such a man as the use is, that is, such as its function is in general. This is true of man because he is a recipient of life from the Lord; for life which is from the Lord is the complex of all things of uses to infinity; since the Lord alone is man, in himself having life, from whom is everything of life; and unless the form of use were infinite in the Lord, it could not possibly exist as finite in any man. 6 In such a form is man in general 17. By man in the most general sense is meant the whole human race; by man in a general sense are meant the men of one kingdom taken together; in a sense less general those of a single province in a kingdom; in a sense still less general those of a city; in a particular sense those of a house; and in an individual sense every man.

But they that perform uses, not for the sake of uses, but for the sake of themselves alone, or the world alone, likewise appear before the Lord as one man, but as an imperfect and deformed man. From what has now been said, it can be seen that the Lord has regard to men in the world, to each according to his use, and to men in the mass according to uses united in the form of a man. By uses are meant the uses of each one’s function, which are the uses of his office, pursuit, and occupation. In the Lord’s sight these uses are good works themselves. 18. Whereas all in any kingdom appear before the Lord as one man according to their love of uses, it is plain that all the English appear before him as one man; likewise all the Dutch, all the Germans, all the Swedes and Danes, also the French, the Spaniards, the Poles, the Russians; but each nation according to its uses. Those in the several kingdoms that love the uses of their offices because they are uses, appear together as a man-angel; and those that love the uses of their offices for the sake of pleasures alone apart from uses appear together as a man-devil. Traders, in the man-angel, are those that love trading, and love wealth for the sake of trading, and at the same time look to God; but traders, in the man-devil, are those that love wealth, and love trading only for the sake of wealth. With the latter there is avarice, which is the root of all evils, but not with the former. For to love wealth alone, and not any use that may come of it, that is, to regard wealth in the first place and trading as secondary, is to be avaricious.

Opulence is not harmful to the latter, but it is to the former. 7 In such a form is heaven 19. It has been shown in Arcana Coelestia that the whole heaven is divided, as it were, into provinces, according to the uses of all the members, organs, and viscera of the human body; also that it is known by angels in the heavens in what provinces the different societies are; for instance, what societies are in the province of the eyes, of the ears, of the nostrils, of the mouth, and of the tongue; also what are in the province of the liver, of the pancreas, of the spleen, of the kidneys, of the ureters, and what in the province of the generative organs. All societies that are in these provinces correspond perfectly to the uses of the above-mentioned members, organs, and viscera in man. It is from this correspondence that the whole heaven appears before the Lord as one man; in like manner each province of heaven, and every society of a province. It is also from this correspondence that all angels and all spirits are men in every respect like men in the world; and for the reason that the Divine proceeding from the Lord, which is life and form, is man, both in what is greatest and in what is least, as has often been said before. This correspondence, in general and in particular, has been treated of in Arcana Coelestia (in the following articles: n. 3021, 3624–3633, 3636–3643, 3741–3745, 3883–3896, 4039–4055, 4218–4228, 4318–4331, 4403–4421, 4523–4533, 4622–4633, 4652–4660, 4791–4805, 4931–4953, 5050–5061, 5171–5189, 5377–5396, 5552–5573, 5711–5727, 10030).

There are many things that bear witness that the Divine love is life itself, and that love therefrom with man is his life; but among these proofs, this is especially clear, namely, that man’s spirit is nothing but affection, consequently that man after death becomes an affection, an angel of heaven if he be an affection of good use, and a spirit of hell if he be an affection of evil use. For this reason the whole heaven is divided into societies according to the genera and species of affections; and likewise, in an opposite manner, hell. From this it is that whether you speak of affections or of societies in the spiritual world, it is the same. 22. By affections are meant the continuations and derivations of love. Love may be compared to a fountain, and affections to the streams issuing from it. Love may also be compared to the heart, and affections to the vessels leading out and continued from it; and it is well known that the vessels that convey blood from the heart resemble their heart in every point, so as to be as it were extensions of it; from this is the circulation of the blood from the heart through the arteries, and from the arteries into the veins, and back to the heart. So with affections; for these are derived and continued from love, and produce uses in forms, and in these proceed from the firsts of the uses to their ultimates, and from these they return to the love from which they started; from all which it is plain that affection is love in its essence; and that use is love in its form. The conclusion from this is that the objects, that is, the ends of affections, are uses, therefore also their subjects are uses, and that the very forms in which affections exist are effects which are effigies of the affections; in which they proceed from the first end to the"

From what has now been said, who cannot see that affection alone is not anything, but that it becomes something by being in use; and that affection for use is nothing but an idea, unless it be in form; and that affection for use in form is nothing but a potency, the affection first becoming something when it is in act? This act is the very use that is meant, which in its essence is affection. Now, since affections are the essence of uses, and uses are the subjects of affections, it follows that there are as many affections as there are uses. 10 There are genera and species of affections, and varieties of species to infinity; so of uses 23. This may be shown from the human body, from the human race, from the angelic heaven, and from the animal and vegetable kingdoms. In each of these there are genera of affections or of uses, and species and varieties, in untold numbers; for there can be no single thing the same as another, but it varies; and this variety is everywhere distinguished into genera and species, and both of these into varieties; and the varieties in themselves are infinite, because they are from the infinite. That this is the case, anyone can see from human faces, of which, from the day of creation, there has never been one so entirely like another as to be the same, nor can there ever be; so in the human body, it is impossible for any least thing therein to be identical with any other.

In heaven the Divine love, which is life itself, is distinguished into two kingdoms; one in which love to the Lord reigns, and another wherein love for the neighbor reigns. In love to the Lord uses as to their source are involved, in love to the neighbor, uses as to their object. The Divine love, which is life itself, is further distinguished into lesser realms, which may be termed provinces; and these again into societies, and these into families and houses. Such in the heavens are the distinctions of the Divine love, into genera, and into species, and the species again into their divisions, which are meant by varieties. Affections, and likewise uses, are thus distinguished, for the reason that every angel is an affection, and is also a use. 25. As all things in hell are in opposition to the things that are in heaven, so it is with the love there. Diabolical love, which is death itself, is there also distinguished into two kingdoms; one in which love of self reigns, and another in which love of the world reigns. In the love of self, evil uses as regards their source, which is self, are involved; and in love of the world evil uses as regards their object are involved; these uses because they are done from self, are also done for the sake of self, for all love returns as in a circle to the source from which it comes. This diabolical love is further distinguished into provinces, and these again into societies, and so on. 26. There are like distinctions of affections in the human body, and parallel distinctions of uses; since, as has been said above, all things of man correspond to all things of heaven. The heart and lungs in man correspond to the two kingdoms of heaven; the members, organs, and viscera in man correspond to the provinces of heaven, and the tissues of the several members, organs, and viscera correspond to the societies of heaven. Since these things in general and in particular are uses, and uses live from the life which is love, their life can be called nothing else than the affection of use.

That the animate things of the earth, and also its plants, are in like manner distinguished into genera and species, and into their varieties, is well known. In the animal kingdom there are two most general divisions; in one are the beasts of the earth, and in the other the birds of heaven. And in the vegetable kingdom there are likewise two most general divisions; in one are fruit-bearing trees, in the other seed-bearing plants. From the distinctions in these it can be seen that there are genera and species of affections, and varieties in the species, to infinity, and in like manner of uses; since, as has been said before, natural affections are the souls of animals, and the uses of affections are the souls of vegetables. 11 There are degrees of affections and of uses 28. There are continuous degrees and there are discrete degrees. Both of these are in every form in the spiritual world and in the natural world. All are acquainted with continuous degrees; few, however, have any knowledge of discrete degrees, and those who have no knowledge of these grope as in the dark when they are investigating the causes of things. Degrees of both kinds are described in Heaven and Hell (n. 38). 29. Continuous degrees, which all know about, are like the degrees from light to shade, from heat to cold, from rarity to density. Such gradations of light, of heat, of wisdom and of love, are in every society of heaven within itself. They who are in the midst of a society are in clearer light than those who are in the ultimates, the light diminishing according to distance from the center even to the ultimates.

The affections of love, which make the wisdom of those in societies and the uses of the affections which make their life, continually lessen from the midst or center even to the ultimates or circumferences. Such are continuous degrees. 30. But discrete degrees are wholly different. These do not advance in one plane to the sides around, but from highest to lowest; and for this reason they are called descending degrees. They are separated as efficient causes and effects are, which in their turn become efficient causes even to the lowest effect. They are also like a producing force in relation to the forces produced, which in turn become producing even to the last product. In a word, they are degrees of the formation of one thing from another; thus they are the degrees from first or highest to last or lowest, where formation subsists. Therefore things prior and posterior, also things higher and lower, are such degrees. All creation was effected through such degrees, and all production is by means of them, and likewise all composition in the nature that belongs to this world; for in analyzing anything that is composite you will see that one thing therein is from another, even to the very last, which is the general of them all. 31. The three angelic heavens are distinguished from each other by such degrees and in consequence one is above another. The interiors of man, which belong to his mind, are distinguished from each other by such degrees; so, too, are light which is wisdom and heat which is love, in the heavens of angels and in the interiors of men; and the same is true of the light itself that proceeds from the Lord as a sun, and of the heat itself that also proceeds from him; and for this reason the light in the third heaven is so refulgent, and the light in the second heaven is of such shining whiteness as to exceed the noonday light of the world a thousandfold. The same is true of the wisdom, for in the spiritual world light and wisdom are in equal degree of perfection. The same is true of the degrees of affections; and as this is true of the degrees of affections it is true also of the degrees of uses, for the subjects of affections are uses. It"

This is an arcanum that has not yet been disclosed. Something of it, indeed, appears in the world, but not in such clearness that it can be seen to be so, for in the world every man receives from the general use the necessary, useful and enjoyable things of life according to the excellence and extent of his service. Some are remunerated from the general use, some are enriched from it. The general use is like a lake from which remunerations and riches flow. These are determined and produced by uses and pursuits which pertain to the affection; nevertheless what the uses themselves are in themselves cannot be concluded from these results; for in the world the evil as well as the good, those who perform no uses, and those who perform evil uses as well as those who perform good uses, are sometimes remunerated and grow rich. In the spiritual world it is otherwise; uses are there laid bare, and their origin is revealed, and their place in the spiritual man which is the Lord in the heavens.

The necessary things of life that are bestowed by the Lord gratuitously and that exist in a moment, are food, clothing and habitation, and these correspond throughout to the use in which the angel is. Things useful are those that are tributary to these three, and are delightful to him who receives them, as well as a variety of embellishments for the table, dress, and home, which are beautiful according to the angel’s use, and of a splendor commensurate to his affection. Things enjoyable are those connected with wife, friends, and associates, all of whom love him and are loved by him. Such mutual and reciprocal love springs from every affection for use. 34. There are such things in heaven because there are such things in man, for heaven corresponds to all things of man; and the man who is in the affection of use from use or for the sake of use is a heaven in the least form. There can be in man no member, or any part in a member, that does not draw from the general use what is necessary, useful, and enjoyable; here the general use provides for every part according to its use; whatever is needed for its work by any part is conveyed to it from neighboring parts, and to these from parts that are near them, and thus from the whole; and the part in like manner shares its own with the rest according to their need. And so it is in the Divine spiritual man, which is heaven, for so it is in the Lord.

From the love of uses we are taught what is meant by loving the Lord and loving the neighbor, also what is meant by being in the Lord and being a man. To love the Lord means to do uses from him and for his sake. To love the neighbor means to do uses to the church, to one’s country, to human society, and to the fellow citizen. To be in the Lord means to be a use. And to be a man means to perform uses to the neighbor from the Lord for the Lord’s sake. 36. To love the Lord means to do uses from him and for his sake, for the reason that all the good uses that man does are from the Lord; good uses are goods, and it is well known that these are from the Lord. Loving these is doing them, for what a man loves he does. No one can love the Lord in any other way; for uses, which are goods, are from the Lord, and consequently are Divine; yea they are the Lord himself with man. These are the things that the Lord can love. The Lord cannot be conjoined by love to any man, and consequently cannot enable man to love him, except through his own Divine things; for man from himself cannot love the Lord; the Lord himself must draw him and conjoin him to himself; and therefore loving the Lord as a person, and not loving uses, is loving the Lord from oneself, which is not loving. He that performs uses or goods from the Lord performs them also for the Lord’s sake. These things may be illustrated by the celestial love in which the angels of the third heaven are. These angels are in love to the Lord more than the angels in the other heavens are; and they have no idea that loving the Lord is anything else than doing goods which are uses, and they say that uses are the Lord with them.

Loving the neighbor means performing uses to the church, one’s country, society, and the fellow citizen, because these are the neighbor in the broad and in the limited sense; neither can these be loved otherwise than by the uses that belong to each one’s office. A priest loves the church, the country, society, the citizen, and thus the neighbor, if he teaches and leads his hearers from zeal for their salvation. Magistrates and officers love the church, the country, society, the citizen, and thus the neighbor, if they discharge their respective functions from zeal for the common good; judges, if from zeal for justice; merchants, if from zeal for sincerity; workmen, if from rectitude; servants, if from faithfulness; and so forth. When with all these there is faithfulness, rectitude, sincerity, justice, and zeal, there is the love of use from the Lord; and from him they have love to the neighbor in the broad and in the limited sense; for who that in heart is faithful, upright, sincere and just, does not love the church, the country, and his fellow citizen? 38. From what has now been said it is plain that loving the Lord is performing uses from him, and loving the neighbor is performing uses to him, and the object on account of whom uses are performed is the neighbor, use, and the Lord; and that love thus returns to him from whom it is. For every love as source through love for its object returns to love as source, which return constitutes its reciprocal. And love continually goes forth and returns through deeds, which are uses, since to love is to do. For love, unless it becomes deed, ceases to be love, since deed is the effect of love’s end, and is that in which it exists. 39. So far as man is in the love of use so far is he in the Lord; because so far is he in the church, and so far in heaven; and the church and heaven from the Lord are as one man; the forms of which (called higher or lower organic forms, also interior and"

Yet all those are there who receive from the Lord the love of uses; and these are they who do them for the neighbor’s sake, for use’s sake, and for the Lord’s sake; and since this man is the Divine that proceeds from the Lord, and the Divine proceeding is the Lord in the church and in heaven, it follows that they all are in the Lord. 40. These are a man, because every use that in any way promotes the general good or serves the public, is a man, beautiful and perfect according to the quality of the use, and at the same time the quality of its affection. The reason of this is, that in each single part of the human body there is, from its use, an idea of the whole; for the part looks to the whole as its source, and the whole sees the part in itself, as its agent. It is from this idea of the whole in each part that each use therein is a man, in small as well as in greater parts; there are organic forms in the part as well as in the whole; in fact, the parts of parts, which are interior, are men more than the composite parts, because all perfection increases toward the interiors. For all organic forms in man are composed of interior forms, and these of forms still more interior, even to inmosts, by means of which communication is given with every affection and thought of man’s mind. For man’s mind, in all its particulars, extends into all things of his body; its range is into all things of the body; for it is the very form of life. Unless the mind had such a field, there would be neither mind nor man. From this it is that the choice and decision of man’s will are determined instantly, and produce and determine actions, just as if thought and will were themselves in the things of the body, and not above them. That every least thing in man, from its use, is a man, does not fall into the natural idea as it does into the spiritual; in the spiritual idea man is not a person, but a use; for the spiritual idea is apart from an idea of person, as it is apart from an idea of matter, space, and time; therefore when one sees another in heaven, he sees him indeed as a man, but he thinks of him as a use.

Those who love themselves and the world are able to perform good uses, and do perform them; but the affections of use with them are not good, because such affections are from self and have regard to self, and are not from the Lord, and do not have regard to the neighbor. They say, indeed, and persuade that these affections have regard to the neighbor in the broad and in the restricted sense; that is, have regard to the church, their country, society, and their fellow citizens. Some of them even dare to say that they have regard to God, because they are from his commandments in the Word; and also that they are from God, because they are goods, and every good is from God; when yet the uses they perform have regard to self, because they are from self, and have regard to the neighbor only that they may return to self. These are known, and are distinguished from those who perform uses from the Lord, having regard to the neighbor in the broad and in the restricted sense, in that such look to self and the world in everything, and love reputation on account of various ends that are uses in behalf of self. Such persons are moved to perform uses so far as in them they see self and what is their own; moreover, their enjoyments are all bodily enjoyments, and these are what they seek from the world. What kind of men they are may be shown by this comparison: They themselves are the head; the world is the body; church, country, and fellow citizens are the soles of the feet; and God is the shoe. But with those that love5 uses from the love of uses, the Lord is the head; church, country, and citizens (which are the neighbor) are the body down to the knees; and the world is the feet, from the knees to the soles; and they themselves are the soles beautifully shod.

Internal thought is the proper thought of his spirit within himself; but external thought is the proper thought of his spirit in the body. Both remain with man after death, and even then it is not known what the quality of the man is until external thought is taken away from him; after that he thinks, speaks, and acts from his affection.

But that they may not continue in their insanity, they are at times remitted into externals, and thereby into their own civil and moral life in which they were in the world.

Their insanities are of many kinds; which may all be included in this, that they will to have dominion, to steal, to commit adultery, to blaspheme, to do evil; to despise, reject, or deride what is honest, just, and sincere, and every truth and good of the church and heaven.

But on the other hand, all those who in the world have loved uses and who have performed uses from the love of them, think sanely in their spirits, and their spirits think sanely in their bodies; for with such, interior thought is also exterior thought, and from the former through the latter is their speech, and likewise their action. Affection of use has kept their mind in itself, nor does it suffer them to stray into vanities, into what is lascivious and filthy, into what is insincere and deceitful, into the mockeries of various lusts. After death they are of a like character; their minds are in themselves angelic; and when the outer thought is taken away, they become spiritual, and angels, and thus recipients of heavenly wisdom from the Lord.

Every man is an affection, for the reason that his life is love, and the continuations and derivations of love are what are called affections; consequently affections in themselves are loves, but subordinate to the general love as their lord or head.

Thus far I have not found one who had known that he was an affection; few even knew what affection is; and when I said that affection is love in its continuation and derivation, they inquired what love is; saying that they know what thought is, because they perceive it; but not what affection is, because no one perceives this. That in the nature of things there is love, they said that they knew from the love of a bride before marriage, and from a mother’s love towards infants, and in some small measure from a father’s love when he kisses a betrothed wife or his infant; and some in place of these said harlot. When I said to them that thought is nothing whatever by itself, but is something by affection, which is of man’s life’s love, because thought is from affection, as a thing is formed by that which forms it; also that thought is perceived, and not affection, because the thing formed is perceived and not what forms it, just as the body is perceived by the bodily senses and the soul is not—inasmuch as they were amazed at what was said to them, they were instructed in the subject by many experiments; as for example, that all things of thought are from affection and according to it; again that they could neither think without affection nor contrary to it, also that everyone is such as his affection is, and therefore everyone is explored from his affection, and no one from his speech; for speech proceeds from the thought belonging to external affection, which is a desire to be courteous, to please, to be praised, to be regarded as good citizens, and men of morality and wisdom, and all these things for the sake of ends belonging to internal affection, of which ends such things are means. And yet from the sound of his speech, unless a man be a consummate hypocrite, the affection itself is heard; for vocal speech belongs to thought, but its sound belongs to affection. Wherefore they were told that as there is no speech without sound, neither can there be thought without affection; and that it is plain therefore that affection is the all of thought, as sound is the all of speech,6 for speech is only the articulation of sound.

From this it follows that there are infinite varieties and differences of affections, as many as there are men that have been born and will be born to eternity. 17 Man has eternal life according to his affection of use 48. Since affection is the man himself, and use is its effect and work, and is as a field or theater for its exercise, and since affection is not found apart from its subject, even so the affection of man’s life is not found apart from use; and since affection and use make one, so man, who is affection, is known as to his quality from use—imperfectly and slightly in the natural world, but clearly and fully in the spiritual world. For the spiritual discloses the affection and all its particulars, since in its essence the spiritual is Divine love and Divine wisdom, and in its manifestation is the heat and the light of heaven; and these disclose the affections of uses, as the heat of the sun of the world discloses objects of the earth by odors and flavors, and its light discloses them by its various colors and distinctions of shade. Every man has eternal life according to his affection of use, for the reason that affection is the man himself; consequently such as the affection is, such is the man. 49. But affection of use in general is of two kinds; there is the spiritual affection of use and there is the natural affection of use. In external form the two are alike, but in internal wholly unlike; for this reason they are not known the one from the other by men in the world, but are readily known by angels in heaven; for they are wholly opposite, since the spiritual affection of use gives heaven to man, while natural affection of use, without the spiritual, gives hell; for the natural affection of use looks only to honors and gains, thus to self and the world as ends, while spiritual affection of use looks"

For there are men in the world who discharge their duties and offices with much zeal, labor, and earnestness; magistrates, overseers, and officers, performing their functions with all diligence and industry; priests, leaders, ministers, preaching with warmth as if from zeal; learned men who write books full of piety, doctrine and learning; and others of a like character; and thereby they perform eminent uses to the church, to their country, to society, and to their fellow citizens; and yet many do these things from natural affection alone, which is for the sake of self, that they may be honored and exalted to dignities, or for the sake of the world, that they may gain wealth and become rich. In some these ends so enkindle the affection for doing uses that they sometimes perform more excellent uses than those do who are in the spiritual affection of use. I have spoken with many after death when they had become spirits, who had been in this kind of affection of use, and who then demanded heaven on the ground of merit; but as they had performed uses from merely natural affection, thus for the sake of self and the world, and not for the sake of God and the neighbor, they received answer like this in Matthew: Many will say to me in that day, Lord, have we not prophesied by thy name, and by thy name have cast out demons, and by thy name done many mighty works? And then will I profess unto them, I know you not; depart from me all ye that work iniquity (Matt. 7:22–23).

From all this it is clear that although they had done uses, yet with themselves they had given no thought to anything but reputation with a view to honors and gains, and that these belonged to their spirit, and they were in them and these were their life, also that their good actions were either purely deceptive appearances, or merely means conducive to these things as ends. Thus much about the natural affection of uses. 51. But the spiritual affection of use is both internal and external, and it is external or natural to the same extent that it is spiritual; for what is spiritual flows into what is natural, and arranges it in correspondence, thus into an image of itself. But as there is in the world at the present day no knowledge of what the spiritual affection of use is, and what distinguishes it from the natural affection, since in outward appearance they are alike, it shall be told how spiritual affection is acquired. It is not acquired by faith alone, which is faith separated from charity, for such faith is merely a thought-faith, with nothing actual in it; and as it is separated from charity it is also separated from affection, which is the man himself; and for this reason it is dissipated after death like something aerial. But spiritual affection is acquired by shunning evils because they are sins; which is done by means of combat against them. The evils that man must shun are all set forth written in the Decalogue. So far as man fights against them because they are sins he becomes a spiritual affection, and thus he performs uses from spiritual life. By means of combat against evils those things that possess one’s interiors are dispersed; and these, as has been said above, with some appear fiery, with some dusky, and with some livid. In this way one’s spiritual mind is opened, through which the Lord enters into his natural mind and arranges it for performing spiritual uses which appear like natural uses. To these and to no others is it granted by the Lord to love him above all things and the neighbor as oneself. If a man by means of combat against evils as sins has acquired anything spiritual in the world, be it ever so small, he is saved, and afterwards his uses grow like a grain of mustard seed into a tree (according to the Lord’s words, Matt. 13:31–32; Mark 4:30–32; Luke 13:18–19)."

The will of man is his affection for the reason that the will of man is the receptacle of his love and the understanding the receptacle of his wisdom; and that which is the receptacle of love is also the receptacle of all affections, because affections are merely continuations and derivations of love, as has been said above. It is called the receptacle of love because love cannot be given with man except in a recipient form which is substantial; without such a form love would have no ability to effect, to reciprocate, and thereby to be permanent. This recipient form might be described, but this is not the place for it. It is from this that the will is called the receptacle of love. 53. That the will is man’s all, and is in all things of man, and thus is the man himself, as love in its whole complex is the man, is evident from this: As to anything pertaining to his love or affection, and in fact to his life, man speaks of willing, as that he wills to act, wills to speak, wills to think, wills to perceive. The will is in all of these things; and if it were not in them man could not act, could not speak, could not think, could not perceive; and if the will were not present in the particular and most particular things of these operations, they would instantly cease; for the will is in them as the soul or life is in the body and in every least particular of it. In place of will, one can say love, as that one loves to do, to speak, to think, to perceive. In like manner of the external senses of the body it is said that one wills to see, wills to hear, wills to eat, drink, and taste, wills to smell, also wills to walk, to associate with others, to seek amusement, and so on. In each one of these the will is the active force; for if it should be withdrawn there would instantly be a stop; and in fact these operations are suspended by the will. 54. That the will is man’s love in form is clearly evident from this, that every enjoyment, pleasure, pleasantness, satisfaction and bliss which belong to man’s love are so felt and perceived; and that these belong to the will is plain, since whatever is enjoyable,"

Man speaks in like manner of good and truth; for that which he loves he calls good, thereby making it to be of his will; and what confirms the good of his love or of his will he calls truth, and this he loves, and wills to think and speak of. Again, in respect to everything that a man wishes, solicits, longs for, strives for, seeks, and intends, he says that he wills all these since they pertain to his love; for he wills what he wishes because he loves it; he wills what he solicits or longs for because he loves it; he wills what he strives for and seeks because he loves it; and he wills what he purposes, and he purposes it because he loves. From all this it can be seen that the will and the love or the will and the affection are one with man; and that the will, because it is the love, is also the life, and is the man himself. That the will is also the life of man’s understanding and of his thought therefrom will be shown in what follows. 55. Man does not know that the will is the man himself, for the same reason that he does not know that the love or affection is the man himself. Moreover, everyone gives attention to those things that he sees or feels, but not to the life, the soul, or the essence from which he sees or feels; this lies concealed within the things pertaining to sensation, and the thought of the natural man does not go so far as that; but it is otherwise with the spiritual man, for the object of his wisdom is not the sense plane, but the essential that is in it, which in itself is spiritual. It is in consequence of this that many say that thought is the all of man, and is the very man, that is, that man is man because he thinks; and yet the all of his thought is affection. Take away affection from thought, and you will be but a stock. A man who is rational from what is spiritual, who knows what is good and what is true, and thus what is evil and what is false, may know from what has been said what his affections are and what his reigning affection is; for there are as many indications of them as there are delights of thought, speech, action, sight, hearing, and as many as there are ambitions, desires, and intentions.

That to love is to will has been shown just above; but that to will is to do remains to be shown. The will viewed in itself is not love, but is a receptacle of love, and such a receptacle that it not only receives it but also takes on its states and assumes forms in accordance with those states; for everything of man’s life flows in, since man is not life but a recipient of life, consequently he is a recipient of love, for love is life. This can be illustrated by the organs of man’s senses. The eye is not light but a recipient of light formed to receive all varieties of light. The ear is not sound but a recipient of sound and of its modulation and articulation. The same is true of man’s other external senses. And the same is true of the internal organs of sense, which are modified and moved by spiritual light and heat; and consequently the same is true of the will, which is a receptacle of spiritual heat, which in its essence is love. This receptacle is in man throughout; but in its first principles it is in the brains. These first principles or beginnings or heads are the substances that are called cortical and cineritious. From these through ray-like fibers it descends on every side into all things of the face and all things of the body, and there performs its gyrations and circlings in accordance with its form, which is the spiritual animal form that has been treated of elsewhere. And thus each and all things therein from things first to ultimates are moved, and in ultimates effects are presented. It is well known that everything is put in motion by an endeavor [conatus]; and that when the endeavor ceases the motion ceases. Thus every voluntary action of man’s will is a living endeavor in man, and it acts in ultimates by means of fibers and nerves, which in themselves are nothing else than perpetual endeavors continued from the beginnings in the brains even to the ultimates in the bodily parts, where endeavors become acts. These things have been presented to make known what the will is, and that it is the receptacle of love in a perpetual endeavor to act; and this endeavor"

From all this it now follows that to love is to do because it is to will; for whatever a man loves that he wills; and what he wills that he does if it is possible; and if he does not do it because it is not possible, it still comes into interior act, which is not made manifest. For no endeavor or volition can exist in man unless it comes into ultimates; and when it is in ultimates it is in interior act, although this act is not perceived by anyone, not even by the man himself, because it exists in his spirit. From this it is that volition and act are a one, and that the volition is counted as the act. This does not apply to the natural world, because in that world the interior act of the will does not appear, but it applies to the spiritual world, for there it is seen. For all in the spiritual world act according to their loves; those who are in heavenly love act sanely; those who are in infernal love act insanely; and if because of any fear they do not act, their will is interiorly active, but is restrained by them from breaking forth; nor does this action cease until the volition ceases. Since, then, the will and the act are a one, and will is the endeavor of love, it follows that in the Word “to love” has no other meaning than to do; thus that “to love the Lord and to love the neighbor” means to perform uses to the neighbor from love which is from the Lord. That this is so the Lord himself teaches in John: He that hath my commandments and doeth them, he it is that loveth me; but he that loveth me not keepeth not my words (John 14:21, 24). Abide ye in my love. If ye have kept my commandments ye shall abide in my love (John 15:9–10). The Lord said three times to Peter, Lovest thou me? And three times Peter answered that he loved; and the Lord three times said to him, Feed my lambs and my sheep (John 21:15–17)."

In this and in no other way is the Lord loved and the neighbor loved. 20 Love produces heat 58. Love produces heat for the reason that love is the very life and living force of all things in the whole world. All endeavors, forces, activities, and movements therein have no other origin than the Divine love which is the Lord, who appears in the heavens before the angels as a sun. That love is one thing and heat another is clearly evident from the difference between them in angel and in man. It is from love that an angel wills and thinks, and has perception and wisdom, and inmostly in himself is sensible of what is blissful and satisfactory, and also loves it. The same is true of man. All this is in their minds; while in their bodies they both feel what is hot apart from any sense of happiness or satisfaction. This makes clear that heat is an effect of the activity of life or of love. That heat is an effect of love can be seen from many things, as that man from inmosts grows warm according to his life’s loves, even in midwinter, and that the heat of the sun of this world has nothing in common with this heat; also that man grows warm, is enkindled, and is inflamed according to the increase of love; and he grows torpid, becomes cold, and dies according to the decrease of love; thus in exact accordance with the activities of love.

In the creation of the universe the Lord prepared for himself all the means, from firsts even to lasts, by which he might produce uses in every degree; and the universal and nearest means of conjunction is heat, in which the essence of the activity of love can exist. As heat exists most nearly from love, there is a correspondence between love and heat, for there is a correspondence between every cause and its effect. It is from correspondence that the sun of heaven, which is the Lord, appears fiery; also that the love that goes forth therefrom is perceived by the angels as heat; likewise that the Lord’s Divine wisdom in the heavens appears as light; also that: The face of the Lord, when he was transfigured, shone as the sun (Matt. 17:2). It is from the same correspondence that the holiness of the Lord’s love was represented by the fire of the altar, and by the fire of the lamps of the lampstand in the tabernacle; also that the Lord appeared in fire on Mount Sinai, and likewise in a flame of fire by night over the tabernacle. It was from this also that many nations made a sacred fire, and that they appointed virgins to its care, who at Rome were called the vestal virgins. It is from the same correspondence that in the Word “fire” and “flame” in many passages mean love, and it is from an interior perception of that correspondence that we pray that holy fire may enkindle our hearts, meaning a holy love. It is from the same correspondence that celestial love appears in heaven at a distance as a fire, and for this reason the Lord said that:"

It is from the same correspondence that infernal love appears in hell at a distance as a fire (on which see Heaven and Hell n. 566–575). 21 Divine love, which is life itself, by means of heat produces spiritual animal forms, with each and every thing in them 60. There are in general two forms which the Lord, the creator of the universe, from his sun, which is Divine love and life itself, has produced in the ultimates and in the inmosts of the world, the animal form and the vegetable form. By animal forms both animals of every kind and men and angels are meant; and by vegetable forms vegetables of every kind, as trees, plants, and flowers, are meant. These two forms have already been treated of (Apocalypse Explained, n. 1196–1212); but as the Divine love is the subject here treated of, and as from this all things have been created, and all things from creation are being formed continually, it is permitted here to say something about the first form, that is, the animal form. 61. The Divine love, which is life itself, from its author who is the Lord, bears nothing else in its bosom than to create and form images and likenesses of itself, which images and likenesses are men and angels from men; and also to cover with a correspondent body affections of every kind, which are animals. All these forms, perfect and imperfect, are forms of love, and are alike in what pertains to their life in externals, which is an inclination to move, to walk, to act, to see, to hear, to smell, to taste, to feel, to eat, to drink, to associate with others, to propagate themselves. But they are unlike in what pertains to their life in internals, which is an inclination to think, to will, to speak, to know, to understand, to be wise, and from these things to find enjoyment and blessedness.

That these several faculties may exist in effect and in use, they have been made and wonderfully organized from created substances and matters. 62. That the Lord, who is man, and his Divine love, which is life itself from its spiritual which proceeds from him as a sun, formed all these, is clearly evident from this, that living souls are also affections, and in externals are all similar, the imperfect as well as the perfect. Who cannot see, unless he is near-sighted or can see by night only, or one whose sight is failing from amaurosis, that such things can have no other source? Elevate your reason only a little above the deep of nature, and you will become wise. 63. That heat is a means of formation is well known from the fluids in which is the embryo in the womb, and the chick in the egg. The belief that the heat of the sun of the world produces, originates in a mind blinded by the fallacies of the bodily senses. The heat of that sun operates only in opening the outermost parts of the body or the cuticles, that internal heat also may flow into them; for in this way life comes into full effect from firsts to ultimates. It is from this that the animals of the earth and the flying things of the heaven every year in the springtime and in the summer enter upon and renew the functions, works, and joys of their prolifications. It is otherwise with man, who has heat from an interior love that is excited by the allurements of his thoughts, and who has garments to protect him against the cold that falls upon the cuticles, which are the outermost parts of his body."

Love in him is being [esse], and wisdom in him is existence [existere]; nevertheless, these are not two in him but one; for wisdom is of love and love is of wisdom; and from this union, which is reciprocal, they become one, and that one is the Divine love, which appears in the heavens before the angels as a sun. The reciprocal union of the Divine wisdom and the Divine love is meant by these words of the Lord: Philip, believest thou not that I am in the Father and the Father in me? Believe me, that I am in the Father and the Father in me (John 14:10–11); and by these words: I and the Father are one (John 10:30). 65. These two, which are one in the Lord, do, indeed, proceed from him as a sun as two distinct things, wisdom as light and love as heat; but they proceed as distinct in appearance, for in themselves they are not distinct, for the light is of the heat and the heat is of the light, and in every least point they are a one, as is true of our sun; for whatever proceeds from the sun is the sun in the least parts, and thus universally in all. It is said, every point and least part, but this does not mean a point or least part of space, for that does not pertain to the Divine, for the Divine is spiritual and not natural."

Since wisdom and love proceed from the Lord as a sun in appearance as two distinct things, wisdom under the form of light, and love under the perception of heat, therefore they are received by the angels as two distinct things, some receiving more of the heat which is love, and some more of the light which is wisdom, and in consequence the angels of all the heavens are distinguished into two kingdoms. Those that have received more of the heat which is love than of the light which is wisdom, make one kingdom, and are called celestial angels, and of such the highest heavens are formed. But those that have received more of the light which is wisdom than of the heat which is love make the other kingdom, and are called spiritual angels, and of such the lower heavens are formed. It is said that these have received more of the light which is wisdom than of the heat which is love, but this excess is an apparent excess, for they are wise only so far as the love with them makes one with the wisdom; and consequently spiritual angels are not called wise but intelligent. Thus much respecting light in the Lord and from the Lord and in the angels. 67. The Divine wisdom that appears in the heavens as light is not light in its essence, but it clothes itself with light that it may appear before the sight of the angels. In its essence wisdom is the Divine truth, and the light is its appearance and correspondence. It is the same with the light of wisdom as with the heat of love, that has been spoken of above. As light corresponds to wisdom, and the Lord is the Divine wisdom, so in the Word, in many passages, the Lord is called “the light,” as in the following: He was the true light, that lighteth every man coming into the world (John 1:9); Jesus said, I am the light of the world, he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life (John 8:12); Jesus said, Yet a little while is the light with you; walk while ye have the light, lest the darkness seize you. While ye have the light believe on the light, that ye may be the sons of the light. I have come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me may not abide in darkness (John 12:35–36, 46);"

His Divine wisdom was also represented by his garments when he was transfigured, that: They appeared as light, glistening and white as snow, so as no fuller on earth can whiten them (Mark 9:3; Matt. 17:2). “Garments” signify in the Word the truths of wisdom; and in consequence all angels in the heavens appear clothed in accordance with the truths of their knowledge, intelligence, and wisdom. 68. That light is an appearance of wisdom, and its correspondence, is evident in heaven but not in the world, for in heaven there is no other light than spiritual light, which is the light of wisdom, and which illuminates all things there that exist from the Divine love. With the angels wisdom enables them to understand these things in their essence, and light enables them to see these things in their form; therefore there is light in the heavens in an equal degree with the wisdom with the angels. In the highest heavens the light is like flame and glowing as if from the most highly burnished gold, because they are in wisdom. In the lower heavens the light is bright and shining as if from the most highly polished silver, because they are in intelligence. In the lowest heavens the light is like the noonday light of the world, because they are in knowledge. The light of the higher heavens is bright, just like a star that glitters and shines brightly in itself in the nighttime; and the light is continual because the sun there never sets. It is the same light as that which enlightens the understanding of those men in the world who love to become wise; but it does not appear to them, because they are natural and not spiritual. It can appear, for it has appeared to me, but before the eyes of my spirit. It has also been granted me to perceive that in the light of the highest heaven I was in wisdom, in the light of the second heaven in intelligence, and in the light of the lowest heaven in knowledge, while in merely natural light I was in ignorance of spiritual things."

That I might know in what light the learned in the world are at the present day, two ways were seen by me; one was called the way of wisdom and the other the way of folly. At the end of the way of wisdom there was a palace in light, but at the end of the way of folly there was something like a palace, but in shade. About three hundred of the learned were there assembled, and they were permitted to choose which way they would take, and two hundred and sixty were seen to enter the way of folly, and only forty the way of wisdom. Those who took the way of wisdom entered the palace that was in light, where there were magnificent things, and garments of fine linen were given them, and they became angels; while those who went in the way of folly wished to enter that which appeared like a palace in the shade, and behold, it was a theater of actors, and there they put on stage garments and masks and talked nonsense and became fools. I was afterwards told that such and so numerous at the present day are the learned fools who are in natural light as compared with the learned wise who are in spiritual light; and that those have spiritual light who love to understand whether that which another says is true; while those have natural light who merely love to confirm what has been said by another. 2 The Lord created with man and afterward forms with him a receptacle of love, which is his will; and he adjoins to this a receptacle of wisdom, which is his understanding 70. As there are two things in the Lord—love and wisdom— and these two proceed from him, and as man was created to be a likeness and an image of the Lord, a likeness through love, and an image through wisdom, so two receptacles were created with man, one for love and the other for wisdom; the receptacle of love is what is called the will, and the receptacle of wisdom is what is called the understanding.

What the forms of these receptacles are cannot be explained because they are spiritual forms, and spiritual things transcend the apprehension. They are forms within forms, ascending even to the third degree, innumerable, separate and yet harmonious, and each particular is a receptacle of love and wisdom. Their origins are in the brains, where they are the beginnings and heads of the fibers through which their endeavors and forces flow down to all things of the body higher and lower, and cause the senses to be present in the sensories, the movements to be present in the moving parts, and the functions of nutrition, of chyle making, of blood making, of separation, of purification, and of prolification to be present in the other organs, thus their uses in each of the particulars. This having been said it will be seen that: 1. These forms, which are the receptacles of love and of wisdom, first exist with man when he has been conceived and is being produced in the womb. 2. From these, by what is continuous with them, all things of the body, from the head even to the soles of the feet, are led forth and produced. 3.

It is known that the head is relatively larger in the beginning; also that the web of all things in the body is produced from it. All this makes clear that these forms are the beginnings. By reason: in that all creation is from the Lord as a sun, which is the Divine love and the Divine wisdom, and the creation of man is from these. The formation of the embryo and of the infant man in the womb is an image of creation, and is called generation, because it is effected by procreation. From this it follows that especially the first forms with man are receptacles of love and wisdom, and that the creation of the other things that constitute the man is effected through these; moreover, no effect exists from itself, but is from a cause prior to it that is called the effecting cause; neither is this from itself, but is from a cause that is called the end, in which is everything that follows in conatus and in idea, in conatus in the Divine love, and in idea in the Divine wisdom, for these are the end of ends. This truth will be more fully established in what follows. 72. 2. From these, by what is continuous, all things of the body, from the head even to the soles of the feet, are led forth and produced This, too, becomes evident by experience, and is confirmed by reason. By experience: in that from these primitive forms fibers are led forth to the sensory organs of the face, which are called the eyes, ears, nostrils, and tongue, also to the motor organs throughout the body, which are called muscles, also to all the organized viscera serving various uses in the body. All these are mere tissues of the fibers and nerves that go forth from both brains and from the spinal marrow. And the blood vessels, from which tissues are also formed, are likewise from fibers that spring from the same source. Anyone skilled in anatomy can see that around about the cerebrum, also inwardly in it and in the cerebellum and in the spinal marrow, there are little spheres like molecules, that are called the cortical and cineritious substances and glands, and that all the fibers whatever that are in the brains, and all the nerves that are from them throughout the body, come out of these little spheres or substances and go forth from them."

By reason: in that fibers are not possible apart from origins, also that the organic parts of the body, produced from fibers variously combined are effects, and effects cannot live, feel, and be moved by themselves, but only from their origins through what is continuous therefrom. This may be illustrated by examples. The eye does not see from itself, but through what is continuous from the understanding; the understanding sees through the eye and moves the eye, directs it to objects and fixes the gaze. Neither does the ear hear from itself, but through what is continuous from the understanding; the understanding hears through the ear; it also directs, incites, and turns it towards sounds. Neither does the tongue speak from itself, but from the thought of the understanding; thought speaks through the tongue and varies the tones and exalts their measures at pleasure. The same is true of the muscles; these are not moved by themselves, but the will together with the understanding moves them, and causes them to act at its bidding. All this makes clear that there is nothing in the body that feels and moves from itself; but only from its origins, in which the understanding and will have their seat; and therefore these are the receptacles in man of love and wisdom; and also these are the first forms, and the organs both of sense and motion are forms derived from these; for influx takes place according to formation, and there is influx from these first forms into the latter, and not reversely; for influx from the former into the latter is spiritual influx, while influx from the latter into the former is natural influx, which is also called physical influx. 73. 3.

There is such a correspondence between spiritual and natural things with man; spiritual things are all things pertaining to his love and wisdom, consequently to his will and understanding, and natural things are all things pertaining to his body. Because these have existed and perpetually exist, that is, subsist from spiritual things, they are correspondences; and therefore the two act as one, like end, cause, and effect. Thus the face acts as one with the affections of the mind, the speech with the thought, and the actions of all the members with the will; and the same is true of other things. It is a universal law of correspondences that the spiritual fits itself to use, which is its end, and actuates and modifies the use by means of heat and light, and clothes it by provided means, until there results a form subservient to the end; and in this form the spiritual acts as the end, use as cause, and the natural as effect; although in the spiritual world the substantial takes the place of the natural.

That if man loves the Lord he is in the Lord and the Lord in him, and the Lord has his abode in him, the Lord himself teaches. All this work of preparation for himself the Lord does in the womb, as will be seen in what follows. This is why Jehovah, or the Lord, is called in the Word: Creator, former, and maker from the womb (Isa. 43:1; 44:2, 24; 49:5). And in David it is said that: Upon him he was cast and laid from the womb (Ps. 22:10; 71:6). While man is in the womb he is in a state of innocence; therefore his first state after birth is a state of innocence; and the Lord dwells in man only in his innocence, consequently he especially dwells in him when he is as it were innocence. Likewise, man is then in a state of peace. Man is then in a state of innocence and in a state of peace, because the Divine love and the Divine wisdom are innocence itself and peace itself, as can be seen in Heaven and Hell (n. 276–290).

In nature nothing exists except from seed, and nothing grows except by means of heat. What kind of form these beginnings have, which belong to man only, will be shown in what follows. As the rudiment of man is seed, and this is a double receptacle of life, it is clear that the human soul is not life from life, that is, life in itself, for there is but one life, and that is God. The source of man’s perception of life has been explained elsewhere. And as there is a continuation of these receptacles from the brains through the fibers into all parts of the body, it is also clear that there is a continuation of the reception of life into these parts, and that thus the soul is not here or there, but is in every form derived from these, just as the cause is in the things caused, and the principle in its derivations. 77. 3.

This is true also of the heat and light of the sun of the world, for in the time of spring and summer heat cooperates with light, and light with heat, and things vegetate and germinate. Likewise love in a state of peace and tranquillity cooperates with wisdom, and wisdom with love, and produces and forms, and this both in the embryo and in the man. That the cooperation of love and wisdom is like the cooperation of heat and light is very clear from appearances in the spiritual world. There love is heat, and wisdom is light; and there all things in the angels are living, and all things around them are blooming, in the exact measure of the union of love and wisdom with them. The union of love and wisdom is reciprocal, love unites itself to wisdom, and"

There is such a reciprocal union and consequent reciprocation between the will and understanding and between good and truth, also between charity and faith, with the man in whom the Lord is; and in fact, such is the reciprocal union of the Lord himself with the church, which is meant by the Lord’s words to the disciples in John, that: They should be in him and he in them (John 14:20; and in other places). The same union is meant by the union of man and wife, in Mark: The twain shall be one flesh, so that they are no more twain, but one flesh (Mark 10:8). For the man was born to be understanding and consequently wisdom, and the woman to be will and consequently the affection which is of love (see Heaven and Hell n. 366–386). As there are two things, love and wisdom, that form the embryo in the womb, so there are two receptacles, one for love and the other for wisdom; so again there are two things in the body throughout, and these likewise are distinct and are united. There are two hemispheres of the brain, two eyes, two ears, two nostrils, two chambers of the heart, two hands, two feet, two kidneys, two testicles, and the rest of the viscera are doubled; and in every case what is on their right side has relation to the good of love, and what is on their left to the truth of wisdom. That these two are so joined together as to act as one mutually and reciprocally, a diligent investigator can see if he will take the trouble. The union itself stands forth to view in the fibers stretched to and fro and interlaced in the midst of their course; and this is the reason of the signification of “right” and “left” in the Word. From all this the truth is clear that love and wisdom unitedly and harmoniously form each and all things in the embryo, and yet in these things they may be distinguished."

The receptacles are distinguished into three degrees with man, one within the other; and the two higher are dwelling places of the Lord, but not the lowest Someone might possibly form a fallacious idea of the beginnings of the human form, which pertain to the seed of the man, because they are called receptacles. From the term receptacle one may easily fall into the idea of a vessel or a little tube. I desire therefore to define and describe that initial form, as it was seen by me and made clear to me in the heavens, as adequately as the expressions of natural language will permit. These receptacles are not tubular, or hollowed out like little vessels, but they are like the brain, of which they are an exceedingly minute and invisible type, with a delineation resembling a face in front, with no visible appendage. This primitive brain in the upper convex part was a structure of contiguous globules or little spheres, each little sphere being a conglomeration of like spheres still more minute, and each of these again of the very least. In front, in the flattened region of the nose, a kind of outline appeared for a face; but in the recess between the convex part and this flattened part there was no fiber; the convex part was covered round about with a very thin membrane, which was transparent. Thus was seen by me and shown to me the primitive of man, the first or lowest degree of which was the structure first described, the second or middle degree was the structure secondly described, and the third or highest degree was the structure thirdly described, thus one was within the other. 79. I was told that in each little sphere there were indescribable interlacings, more and more wonderful according to the degrees, also that in each particular the right part is the couch or receptacle of love, and the left part is the couch or receptacle of wisdom, and that by wonderful connections these are like partners and comrades, the same as the two hemispheres of the brain are. It was further shown in the light that fell brightly on it, that the structure of the two interior degrees was, in its position and flow, in the order and form of heaven, while the structure of the lowest degree in its position and flow, was in the form of hell. This is why it is said that the receptacles are distinguished into three degrees with"

The lowest degree is such because man, from a hereditary taint, is born opposed to the order and form of heaven, and thus into evils of every kind; and this taint is in the natural, which is the lowest of man’s life, and it is not wiped away unless the interior degree that has been formed for the reception of love and wisdom from the Lord is opened in him. But how this degree and the inmost degree are opened is taught by the Lord in the Word, and will be taught in what follows. But to gain light on this subject, see what has been said before about degrees, also about the brain. 80. These degrees are called higher, although they are interior, and for the reason that there is successive order of degrees and simultaneous order; things higher and lower are in successive order, but things interior and exterior are in simultaneous order, and the same things that in simultaneous order are interior, in successive order are higher; and the same is true of things exterior and lower. And as there are three degrees in man so there are three degrees of the heavens, for the heavens consist of men who have become angels. According to degrees in successive order, the heavens are seen one above another, and according to degrees in simultaneous order, one within another. From this it is that “high” signifies in the Word what is internal, and the Lord is called “most high,” because he is in inmost things. Since, then, man in the beginning of his development is such a dwelling place of the Lord as has been described, and these three degrees are then open, and since everything that proceeds from the Lord as a sun is man in least things and in greatest (as has been shown before in its place), so extension into any other form than the human is not possible; nor is extension possible except through rays of light from wisdom with heat from love in the midst; thus through vivified fibers, which are rays brought out into form. That there is a like determination is apparent to the eye. 81. So many are the degrees of life with man; but with beasts the two higher degrees are lacking and they have only the lowest; consequently the beginnings of their life are not receptacles of the"

With clean beasts these receptacles are not reflected or turned contrary to the order of the flux of the universe, but are conformable to it; therefore from birth, as soon as they are brought forth, they are led into their functions and know them. For beasts have had no ability to pervert their affections, since they have not the intellectual faculty to think and reason from spiritual light, and to violate the laws of Divine order. 82. 5. One receptacle is for the will of the future man and the other for his understanding; and yet nothing whatever of his will or of his understanding is present in the formation Will and understanding with man do not begin until the lungs are opened, and this does not take place until after birth; then the will of man becomes the receptacle of love, and the understanding becomes the receptacle of wisdom. They do not become such receptacles until the lungs are opened, because the lungs correspond to the life of the understanding, and the heart corresponds to the life of the will, and without the cooperation of the understanding and will, man has no life of his own, as there is no life apart from the cooperation of love and wisdom by means of which the embryo is formed and vivified, as has been said before. In the embryo the heart alone beats, and the liver leaps, the heart for the circulation of the blood, and the liver for the reception of nourishment; from these is the motion of the other viscera, and this motion is felt as pulsative after the middle period of gestation. But this motion is not from any life proper to the fetus; one’s own life is the life of the will and the life of the understanding; while the life of the infant is the life of commencing will and commencing understanding; from these only do the sensitive and the motor life in the body exist; and this life is not possible from the beating of the heart alone, but is possible from the conjunction of this with the respiration of the lungs. This is seen to be true in men, who have both will and understanding; when they fall into a swoon or are suffocating, and respiration stops, they become as if dead; they have no sensation, their limbs do not move, they do not think nor will, and yet the heart performs its contractions and the blood"

From all this a conclusion may be formed about the quality of the life of the fetus in the womb, in which only the heart performs its motions, and not yet the lungs, namely, that nothing of the life of the will and nothing of the life of the understanding is present in it; but the formation is effected solely by the life from the Lord by which man afterwards is to live. But about this more may be seen in the following article. 83. 6. There is life in the embryo before birth, but the embryo is not conscious of it This follows from what has been said above; also that the life from which the embryo in the womb lives is not its life, but the Lord’s alone, who alone is life. 4 There is a likeness and analogy between the formation of man in the womb and his reformation and regeneration 84. The reformation of man is altogether similar to his formation in the womb, with this difference only, that for a man to be reformed he must have will and understanding, while in the womb he has no will and understanding; but this difference does not exclude the likeness and analogy. For when the Lord reforms and regenerates a man he leads his will and understanding in like manner. But through the will given to man and through the understanding given to him there is an appearance that the man himself leads himself, that is, wills and acts from himself, and thinks and speaks from himself; and yet he knows from the Word and from doctrine from the Word that it is not himself but the Lord, consequently that all this is only an appearance. He may also know that this appearance is for the sake of reception and appropriation, since without it there is not given the reciprocal to"

Without that reciprocal man would be like an automaton, in which the Lord could not be present; for the Lord wills to be loved, and consequently he gives to man the ability to will to love him. From this it is clear that neither the will nor the understanding is man’s, but in themselves both are as they were in man in the womb, that is, they are not his; but these two faculties were given to man that he might will and think and act and speak as if from himself, and yet know, understand, and believe that they are not from himself. By this man is reformed and regenerated, and receives love in his will and wisdom in his understanding, from which two he was formed in the womb. By this also the two higher degrees of man’s life are opened in him, and these, as has been said, were the dwelling places of the Lord in his formation; also the lowest degree is reformed, which, as has also been said above, was inverted and reflected. From this analogy and likeness it is clear that the man who is being regenerated is as it were conceived, formed, born, and educated anew, and this to the end that as to love he may become a likeness of the Lord, and as to wisdom an image of the Lord, and, if you are willing to believe it, the man is thereby made a new man, not alone in having a new will and a new understanding given him, but even a new body for his spirit. The former things, indeed, are not effaced, but are so removed as not to appear, and through love and wisdom, which are the Lord, new things are formed in the regenerate man as in a womb; for such as the will and understanding of man are, such is the man in each and all things; since each and all things of man from head to heel are productions, as has been shown above. 5 With man after birth the will becomes the receptacle of love and the understanding the receptacle of wisdom7 85.

This also makes clear that love is of the will, for what a man loves that he also wills, and that wisdom is of the understanding, for that in which a man is wise, or which he knows, he sees with the understanding; the sight of the understanding is thought. So long as man remains in the womb he does not have these two faculties; as it has been shown above that nothing whatever of will or of understanding belongs to the fetus in its formation. From this it follows that the Lord has prepared two receptacles, one for the will of the future man, and the other for his understanding, the receptacle called the will for the reception of love, and the receptacle called the understanding for the reception of wisdom; also that he has prepared these by means of his love and his wisdom; but these two do not pass into the man until he has been fully formed for birth. Moreover, the Lord has provided means for the more and more full reception in these of love and wisdom from himself as man matures and grows old. 86. The will and understanding are called receptacles because the will is not an abstract spiritual thing, but is a subject substantialized and formed for the reception of love from the Lord; and the understanding is not an abstract spiritual thing, but is a subject substantialized and formed for the reception of wisdom from the Lord; for these actually exist; and although hidden from the sight they are interiorly in the substances that constitute the cortex of the brain, and also here and there in the medullary substance of the brain, especially in the striated bodies, also interiorly in the medullary substance of the cerebellum, and in the spinal marrow, of which they constitute the nucleus. Thus there are not merely two but innumerable receptacles, each one doubled and of three degrees, as has been said above. That these are receptacles and that they are there is clearly evident from this, that they are the beginnings and heads of all the fibers out of which the whole body is woven, and that all the organs of sense and motion are formed out of fibers that extend from these, for these are their beginnings and ends.

With infants these receptacles are small and tender; afterwards they receive increase and are perfected according to knowledges and affections for knowledges; they are perfected according to intelligence and the love of uses; they are made soft according to innocence and love to the Lord; and they grow solid and hard from the opposites of these. Their changes of state are affections; their variations of form are thoughts; memory is the existence and permanence of both of these; and recollection is their reproduction. The two taken together are the human mind. 6 There is a correspondence of the heart with the will and of the lungs with the understanding 87. This is a thing unknown in the world, because it has not been known what correspondence is, and that there is a correspondence of all things in the world with all things in heaven; also that there is a correspondence of all things of the body with all things of the mind in man, for correspondence is of things natural with things spiritual. But what correspondence is, and the nature of it, also with what things in the human body there is correspondence, has been told above. As there is a correspondence of all things of the body with all things of the mind in man, there is primarily a correspondence with the heart and lungs. This correspondence is universal, because the heart reigns throughout the body and also the lungs. The heart and the lungs are the two fountains of all natural movements in the body, and the will and understanding are the two fountains of all spiritual activities in the same body; and the natural movements of the body must correspond to the activities of its spirit; if they did not correspond the life of the body and also the life of the mind would cease; it is correspondence that makes both of these to exist and subsist."

That the heart corresponds to the will, or, what is the same, to the love, is evident from the variation of its pulse according to the affections. Its variations are that its beat is either slow or quick, full or feeble, soft or hard, equal or unequal, and so forth. Thus it differs in gladness and in sorrow, in tranquillity of mind and in anger, in bravery and in fear, when the body is warm and when it is cold, also variously in disease, and so forth. All affections belong to the love and thus to the will. As the heart corresponds to the affections belonging to the love, and thus to the will, the wise men of old ascribed affections to the heart, and some placed there the abode of affections. This is the source of the common expressions, “a magnanimous heart,” “a timid heart,” “a joyful heart,” “a sad heart,” “a soft heart,” “a hard heart,” “a great heart,” “a little heart,” “a whole heart,” “a broken heart,” “a heart of flesh,” “a stony heart,” “fat, soft, or vile in heart,” “having no heart,” “giving the heart to do,” “giving a single heart,” “giving a new heart,” “laying up in the heart,” “receiving in the heart,” “not reaching the heart,” “hardening one’s heart,” “lifted up in heart,” “a friend in heart,” also the terms “concord,” “discord,” “madness” [vecordia], and many other like expressions. And in the Word, the “heart” everywhere signifies the will or love, for the reason that the Word was written throughout by means of correspondences. 89. It is similar with the lungs, the breath or spirit [anima seu spiritus] of which signifies the understanding; for as the heart corresponds to the love or will, so the breath or spirit of the lungs, which is the respiration, corresponds to the understanding. This is why it is said in the Word that man must love God “with the whole heart and the whole soul,” which signifies that he must love with the whole will and the whole understanding. Also that God will create in man “a new heart and a new spirit,” where “heart” signifies the will, and “spirit” the understanding, because when man is regenerated he is created anew. For the same reason it is said of Adam that Jehovah God breathed into his nostrils “the soul of lives,” and made him “a living soul,” which signifies that God breathed into him wisdom. Moreover, “the nostrils,” from the correspondence of respiration through them, signify perception, and for this reason an intelligent man is said to be “keen-scented,”"

This was done in order to make evident that the Divine wisdom, which is meant by “the Holy Spirit,” proceeds from him. That soul and spirit are predicated of respiration is also known from common speech, for it is said of man when he dies that he “gives up the ghost” [anima seu spiritus], for he then ceases to breath and respire [animare et spirare]. Also, “spirit” in most languages means both the spirit in heaven and the breath of man, and also wind. From this comes the idea that prevails with many that spirits in the heavens, also the souls of men after death, and even God himself, because he is called a spirit, are like winds; and yet God himself is man; and so is the soul of man after death, also every spirit in the heavens; but they are so called because from correspondence “soul” and “spirit” signify wisdom. 90. That the lungs correspond to the understanding as the heart does to the will is further evident from man’s thought and speech. All thought is of the understanding, and all speech is of thought. Man cannot think except the breath of the lungs concurs and agrees, consequently when he thinks tacitly he breathes tacitly; if he thinks deeply he breathes deeply; likewise if he thinks slowly, quickly, intently, gently, eagerly, and so forth; if he holds his breath entirely he is unable to think except in the spirit and by its respiration; and so forth. That the speech of the mouth that proceeds from the thought of man’s understanding makes one with the respiration of the lungs, and so makes one that he cannot produce the least of sound and the least part of a word without the concurrent aid of the lungs through the larynx and the epiglottis, everyone can know from living experience in himself, if he wishes to."

That the heart corresponds to the will and the lungs to the understanding is clear also from the universal government of each in the body throughout, and in all and each of its parts. It is known that the heart governs in the body by arteries and veins. That the lungs govern there any anatomist can see; for the lungs by their respiration act upon the ribs and the diaphragm, and through these by means of ligaments and by means of the peritoneum, upon all the viscera of the entire body, also upon all its muscles; and they not only enwrap these, they also penetrate deeply within, and so deeply that there is not the least part in a viscus or muscle, from surface to inmost, that does not derive something from the ligaments, consequently from the respiration. This is especially true of the stomach, because its esophagus passes through the diaphragm and is closely related to the trachea which goes forth from the lungs. For this reason the heart itself has besides its own motion a pulmonary motion, for it rests upon the diaphragm, and lies in the bosom of the lungs, and through its auricles is coherent and continuous with them; also from the lungs the respiratory motion passes into the arteries and veins. Thus the heart and lungs are bedfellows in a common chamber separate from the rest of the body, which chamber is called the chest. From all this the acute observer can see that all living motions which are called actions, and which exist by means of the muscles, are accomplished by the cooperation of the motion of the heart and the motion of the lungs, and this enters into each one of them, both the general which is external and the particular which is internal; and he who is clear-sighted can also see that these two fountains of bodily motions correspond to the will and the understanding, since they are produced from these. 92. This, too, has been shown from heaven. It was granted me to be present with angels who presented this in a living way.

They thus represented the particulars in the heart and the particulars in the lungs and their union, which they called the marriage of love and wisdom. And they said that it is the same throughout the body, and in its particular members, organs, and viscera, with the things pertaining to the heart in them, and the things pertaining to the lungs in them; and that where these do not both act and each take its turn distinctly, no motion of life from any voluntary principle, and no sense of life from any intellectual principle is possible. 93. From what has been said thus far, a man who wishes to gain wisdom even in respect to causes can be taught and can learn how the will conjoins itself to the understanding and the understanding to the will, and how they act in conjunction; from the heart how the will does this, from the lungs how the understanding does this, and from the conjunction of the heart and lungs what the reciprocal conjunction of the will and understanding is. And from all this the truth of the preceding article is established, namely, that in man after birth the receptacle of love becomes the will, and the receptacle of wisdom becomes the understanding; for after birth the lungs are opened, and these with the heart inaugurate the active life which pertains to man’s will, and the sensitive life which pertains to his understanding. These lives do not exist from the separate operation of the heart, or from the separate operation of the lungs, but from their cooperation; nor do they exist apart from correspondence, or in a swoon, or in cases of suffocation. 7 The conjunction of the body and the spirit in man is through the motions of his heart and lungs, and a separation takes place when these motions cease 94. That this may be comprehended it is necessary for some things to be premised which may as it were bear a torch in advance. The truth will appear from the following propositions:"

The life of the body, which is natural, exists and subsists through that influx, and ceases by its removal, thus by the separation. 5. Man then from natural becomes spiritual. 95. 1. The spirit of man is equally a man Of this you will find many proofs in Heaven and Hell (n. 73–77, 311–316, 445–452, 461–469); also that every man as to his interiors is a spirit (n. 432–444).

From this is the Divine omnipresence.

They know also from the Word that angels have been seen by many as men, who did not assume a human form, but they manifested themselves in their own form before the eyes of their spirits which were then opened. That man, therefore, may no longer remain in a fallacious idea respecting spirits and angels and his own soul after death, it has pleased the Lord to open the sight of my spirit, and to permit me to converse face to face with angels and men that have died, and to observe them and touch them, and to say many things about the unbelief and fallacies of men who are still living. With these I have had daily association from the year 1744 to the present time, a period of nineteen years. From all this it can be seen that the spirit of man is equally a man. 96. 2. The spirit of man has equally a heart and pulsation therefrom, and lungs and respiration therefrom This shall first be confirmed by experience, and afterwards by reason. By experience: The angelic heaven is divided into two kingdoms, one called celestial and the other called spiritual. The celestial kingdom is in love to the Lord, and the spiritual kingdom is in wisdom from that love. Heaven is thus divided because love and wisdom in the Lord and from the Lord are two distinct things, and yet are united; for they are distinct as heat and light from the sun are, as has been said above. The angels of the celestial kingdom, because they are in love to the Lord, have relation to the heart of heaven; and the spiritual angels, because they are in wisdom from that love have relation to the lungs of heaven; for the whole heaven, as has been said above, is in the Lord’s sight as one man. Moreover, the influx of the celestial kingdom into the spiritual kingdom is like the influx in man of the heart into the lungs. Thus there is a universal correspondence of heaven with these two motions, that of the heart and that of the lungs, in everyone. I have also been permitted to learn from the angels that their arteries have a pulsation from the heart, and that they breathe the same as men in the world do; also that with them the pulsations vary with the states of love, and the respiration with the states of wisdom. They themselves have touched their wrists, and have told me so, and I have often perceived the respiration of their mouth."

As the entire heaven is divided into societies according to the affections which belong to love, and as all wisdom and intelligence is according to these affections, so each society has its peculiar respiration distinct from the respiration of any other society, likewise its peculiar and distinct pulsation of the heart; therefore no one can enter from one society into another that is separated from it, nor can anyone descend from a higher heaven into a lower, or ascend from a lower into a higher, without causing the heart to labor and the lungs to be oppressed; least of all can anyone ascend from hell into heaven; if he ventures to ascend he pants like one in the agony of death, or like a fish lifted from the water into the air. The most general difference in respiration and pulsation is according to the idea of God, for from that idea the differences of love and of wisdom therefrom spring; and for this reason a nation of one religion cannot approach nations of another religion. I have seen that Christians could not approach Mohammedans on account of the respiration. The most easy and gentle breathing is enjoyed by those who have the idea that God is man; and from the Christian world those who have the idea that the Lord is the God of heaven; while those who deny his divinity, as the Socinians and Arians do, have a hard and rough breathing. As the pulsation makes one with the love of the will, and the respiration makes one with the wisdom of the understanding, therefore those who are about to come into heaven are introduced into angelic life by harmonious respirations; and this is effected in various ways; and from this they come into interior perceptions and into heavenly freedom. 98. By reason: The spirit of a man is not a substance that is separate from his viscera, organs, and members, but it cleaves to them in close conjunction; for the spiritual goes along with every fiber of these from outermosts to innermosts; and thus with every fiber and filament of the heart and lungs; consequently, when the bond between man’s body and spirit is loosed the spirit is in a form like that in which the man was before; there is only a separation of spiritual substance from material. For this reason the spirit has a heart and lungs the same as the man in the world, and for the same"

Spirits also have atmospheres, but spiritual. How greatly, then, are those deceived who assign to the soul a special seat somewhere in the brain or in the heart, for the soul of man, which is to live after death, is his spirit. 99. 3. This pulsation of its heart and the respiration of its lungs flow into the pulsation of the heart and the respiration of the lungs with man in the world This, too, must be confirmed by experience and afterwards by reason. By experience: It is not known that during his life in the world man has a double respiration of the lungs, and a double pulsation of the heart; because it is not known that man in regard to his interiors is a spirit, and that a spirit is equally a man. But it has been granted to perceive sensibly that these two motions exist continually in man, and that these two motions of the spirit flow into the two motions of the body. I was once admitted into these motions when certain spirits were with me, who from a strong power of persuasion were able to deprive the understanding of the faculty of thinking and at the same time to take away the ability of breathing. That this might do me no harm I was brought into the respiration of my spirit, which I then plainly felt to be harmonious with the respiration of the angels of heaven. And from this it was clear that heaven in general and every angel there in particular breathes; also that so far as the understanding suffers, the respiration also suffers; for the power to persuade that is possessed by some evil spirits in the spiritual world at the same time suffocates, consequently this power is called suffocative in reference to the body, and destructive in reference to the mind. On one occasion it was also granted to the angels to control my respiration, and to diminish and gradually withdraw the respiration of my body until only the respiration of my spirit remained, which I then sensibly perceived. Moreover, I have been in the respiration of my spirit whenever I have been in a state like that of spirits and angels, and whenever I have been raised up into heaven; and oftentimes I have been in the spirit and not in the body, at other times both in"

See Heaven and Hell (n. 449) for an account of the removal of the animation of the lungs and of the body, while the animation of my spirit remained. 100. By reason: From these living experiences it can be seen that since every man enjoys a double respiration, one within the other, he has the power to think rationally and also spiritually from his understanding, and by this is distinguished from the beasts; also that as to his understanding he can be enlightened, raised up into heaven, and respire with the angels, and thus be reformed and regenerated. Moreover, where there is an external there must be an internal, and the internal must be in every action and in every sensation; the external supplies the general and the internal the particular, and where there is no general there is no particular. For this reason there is in man both an external and an internal systolic and animative motion, an external which is natural and an internal which is spiritual. And thus the will together with the understanding can produce bodily motions, and the understanding with the will can produce bodily sensations. General and particular pulsations and respirations exist also in beasts but with them both the external and internal are natural, while with man the external is natural and the internal is spiritual. In a word, such as the understanding is such is the respiration, because such is the spirit of man; and the spirit is what thinks from the understanding and wills from the will. That these spiritual operations may flow into the body and enable man to think and will naturally, the respiration and pulsation of the spirit must be conjoined to the respiration and pulsation of the body, and there must be an influx of one into the other; otherwise no transfer is effected. 101. 4. The life of the body, which is natural, exists and subsists through that influx, and ceases by its removal, thus by the separation A man after death is just as much a man as before death, except that after death he becomes a spirit-man, for the reason that his spiritual is adjoined to his natural, or the substantial of the spirit to the material of the body, so fitly and unitedly that there is not a filament or fiber or smallest thread of them in which the human of"

And as the life of the whole and the life of the parts depend solely on these two most general motions, the systolic motion of the heart and the respiratory motion of the lungs, it follows that when these motions in the body cease, natural things, which are material, are separated from the spiritual things, which are substantial, because they are no longer able to do the same work together; and in consequence the spiritual which is the essential active withdraws from the particulars acted upon, which are natural, and thus the man becomes another man. This, therefore, is the death of man and this is his resurrection, about which some things from living experience may be seen in Heaven and Hell (n. 445–469). 102. It is known that when respiration ceases man seems to be dead, and yet man is not dead until the motion of the heart also ceases, and this commonly takes place later. That until this the man is not dead is shown by the life of infants in the womb, and by the life of adults in swoon or suffocation, in which the heart maintains its contractions and dilations, while the lungs are at rest, and yet they live, although without sensation and motion, thus without any consciousness of life. The reason of this is that the respiration of the spirit then continues, but there is no corresponding respiration of the body, and thus no reciprocation between the two vital motions, that of the heart and that of the lungs; and without correspondence and reciprocation there is no sensitive life, neither is there any action. What is true of the natural life of man’s body is true also of the spiritual life of his mind. If the will and understanding, or love and wisdom, do not act conjointly, no rational operation can take place. If the understanding or wisdom withdraws, the will with its love becomes as it were dead; nevertheless, it continues to live, though with no consciousness of itself, so long as the understanding only ceases to act, as takes place when memory fails. But it is otherwise when the will or love recedes; then all is over with the mind of man, as all is over with him when the heart stops beating.

Man then from natural becomes spiritual A natural man is wholly different from a spiritual man, and a spiritual man from a natural man; the difference is so great that they cannot be given together. One who does not know what the spiritual is in its essence may believe that the spiritual is only a purer natural, which in man is called the rational; but the spiritual is above the natural, and as distinct from it as the light of midday from the evening shadow in the time of autumn. The distinction and the difference can be known only to one who is in both worlds, the natural and the spiritual, and who can change alternately from one to the other, and be in one and then in the other, and by reflection can look at one from the other. From this privilege, which has been granted to me, I have learned what the natural man is and what the spiritual man is who is a spirit. That this may be known it shall be described briefly. 104. In all things of his thought and speech, and in all things of his will and action, the natural man has as his subject matter, space, time and quantity; with him these are fixed and permanent, and without them he can have no idea of thought and speech from it, and no affection of the will and action from it. The spiritual man or the spirit does not have these as subjects, but only as objects. The reason is that in the spiritual world the objects are altogether similar to those in the natural world; there are lands, plains, fields, gardens and forests, houses containing rooms, and in them all useful things; moreover, there are garments for women and for men, such as are in the world; there are tables, food, and drinks, such as are in the world; there are also animals, both gentle and destructive; there are spaces and times, and numbers and measures. All these things have such a resemblance to the things that are in the world that to the eye they cannot be distinguished, and yet all these are appearances of the wisdom belonging to the understanding of angels, and perceptions of loves belonging to their wills; for these objects are created in a moment by the Lord, and in"

They are permanent or not permanent according to the constancy or inconstancy of the spirits or angels in the things of which they are the appearances. This is why these things are merely objects of their thoughts and affections, while their subjects are those things of which these are the appearances, which, as has been said, are such things as relate to wisdom and love, thus spiritual things. For example, when they see spaces they do not think of them from space; when they see gardens containing trees, fruits, shrubs, flowers, and seeds, they do not think of these from their appearance but according to the things from which these appearances spring; and so in all other cases. In consequence of this the thoughts of the spiritual, and their affections also, are wholly different from the thoughts and affections of the natural, and so different that they transcend natural ideas and do not fall into them except in some measure into the interior rational sight, and this in no other way than by withdrawals or removals of quantities from qualities. 105. This shows clearly that the angels have a wisdom that is incomprehensible and also ineffable to the natural man. As their thoughts are such so their speech is such, and so different from the speech of men that they do not agree in a single expression. The same is true of their writing; although as to its letters this resembles the writing of men in the world, no man in the world can understand it. Every consonant in their writing expresses a distinct meaning, every vowel a distinct affection. The vowels are not written, but pointed. Their manual employments, which are innumerable, and the duties of their callings, likewise differ from the employments and duties of natural men in the world, and cannot therefore be described in the terms of human language. From these few instances it can be seen that the natural and the spiritual differ from each other like shadow and light. Nevertheless, there are various differences; there are some who are sensual- spiritual, some who are rational-spiritual, and some celestial- spiritual, also there are the spiritual evil and the spiritual good. The differences are according to the affections and the thoughts"

From all this it is clear that man from natural becomes spiritual as soon as the lungs and heart of the body cease to be moved, and by this means the material body is separated from the spiritual body. 8 There is and there can be no angel or spirit that was not born a man in the world 106. It has been shown in Heaven and Hell (n. 311–317) that angels were not created such immediately; but all who are or have been in heaven were born as men, and became angels after a life passed in the world. That no angel could exist except from a man born in the world, and that this is according to the Divine order, will be seen from the following propositions: 1. In man there is an angelic mind. 2.

This makes clear that there is in man an angelic mind. To this may be added that this mind is the man himself; for every man is a man by virtue of this mind, and such as this mind is such is the man. The body with which this mind is clothed and compassed in the world is not in itself the man, for the body cannot be wise from the Lord and love him from itself, but only from its mind; consequently the body is separated and cast off when the mind is about to depart and become an angel. And then man comes into angelic wisdom, because the higher degrees of the life of his mind are opened; for every man has three degrees of life; the lowest degree is natural, and man is in that while in the world; the second degree is spiritual, and in that is every angel in the lower heavens; the third degree is celestial, and in that is every angel in the higher heavens. And man is an angel so far as the two higher degrees are opened in him in the world by means of wisdom from the Lord and by means of love to him. And yet in the world man does not know that these degrees have been opened. This he does not know until he has been separated from the first degree which is natural; and the separation is effected through the death of the body. That he is then wise like an angel, though not so in the world, it has been granted me both to see and hear. I have seen in the heavens many of each sex who were known to me in the world, and who, while they lived there, believed in simplicity those things that are from the Lord in the Word, and had lived faithfully according to them; and these were heard in heaven speaking things ineffable, as is said of the angels. 108. 2. Such a mind can be formed only in man For this there are many reasons. For all Divine influx is from first things into ultimates, and through a connection with ultimates into intermediates, and thus the Lord binds together all things of creation, and for this reason he is called “the first and the last.” For"

The same is true of every Divine operation. This is so because in ultimates all things coexist, for all things that are in successive order are in ultimates in simultaneous order; consequently all things that are in simultaneous order are in a continuous connection with all things in successive order. This makes clear that the Divine in the ultimate is in its fullness. What successive order is and the nature of it, and what simultaneous order is and the nature of it, may be seen above. From this it is clear that all creation has been effected in ultimates, and that every Divine operation passes through to ultimates and there creates and operates. 109. That the angelic mind is formed in man is evident from man’s formation in the womb, also from his formation after birth, also from the law of Divine order that all things should return from ultimates to the first from which they are, and man to the creator from whom he is. This is evident from the formation of man in the womb, as can be seen from what has been said above, where it was shown that by life that is from the Lord man is fully formed in the womb for birth, for the reception of life from the Lord, for the reception of love by means of a future will, and for the reception of wisdom by means of a future understanding, which together constitute the mind which is capable of becoming angelic. This is evident from man’s formation after birth, in that all the means have been provided that man may become such a mind; for every nation has a religion, and the Lord’s presence is everywhere, and there is a conjunction with him according to the love and wisdom therefrom. Thus there is in every man a capacity to be formed, and in one who desires it there is from his infancy to old age a continual formation for heaven, that he may become an angel."

This is evident from the law of Divine order that all things should return from ultimates to the first from which they are, as can be seen from every created thing in the world. The seed is the first thing of a tree. From the seed the tree rises out of the earth, puts forth branches, blossoms, produces fruit, and stores up seed therein, and thus returns to that from which it was. This is true of every shrub, plant, and flower. Also seed is the first thing of the animal, which is formed for birth either in the matrix or the egg, and afterwards grows and becomes an animal of the same kind, and when it has come to maturity has seed in itself. Thus everything in the animal kingdom, like everything in the vegetable, from its first rises to its last, and from its last rises again to its first from which it was. The same is true of man, but with this difference, that the first of an animal and of a vegetable is natural, consequently when it has risen it relapses into nature; while the first of man is spiritual like his soul, receptive of Divine love and Divine wisdom; and when this is separated from the body, which relapses into nature, it must needs return to the Lord, from whom it has life. Other types of the same thing present themselves in both kingdoms, the vegetable and the animal; in the vegetable from their resuscitation out of ashes, and in the animal from the metamorphosis of caterpillars into the chrysalides and the butterflies. 111. 3. Only in man can the angelic mind be procreated and be multiplied by procreations One who knows what the substances in the spiritual world are, and relatively what the matters in the natural world are, can easily see that no procreation of angelic minds is possible or can be possible except in those and from those who dwell upon an earth, the ultimate work of creation. But as it is not known what the substances in the spiritual world are relatively to the matters in the natural world, it shall now be told. Substances in the spiritual world appear to be material, although they are not, and because they are not material they are not permanent."

Furthermore, with the angels there is and there can be no procreation, and no consequent multiplication, except such as is spiritual, which has relation to wisdom and love, and such as pertains to the souls of men who are born anew or regenerated. But in the natural world there are matters by means of which and out of which procreations and afterwards formations can be effected, thus multiplications of men, and of angels therefrom. 112. 4. From this, spirits and angels derive the ability to subsist, and to live to eternity They have this for the reason that an angel or spirit from having been first born a man in the world takes to himself permanent existence; for from the inmosts of nature he takes to himself a medium between the spiritual and the natural by which he is so terminated that he may subsist and endure. Through this he has what gives him a relation to the things that are in nature, and corresponding with them. 5. Through this also spirits and angels can be adjoined and conjoined to the human race, for there is conjunction, and where there is conjunction there must be a medium The angels know that there is such an intermediate, but as that intermediate is from the inmosts of nature, and the expressions of language are from the ultimates of nature, it can be described only by means of abstract terms. 6.

This is because everything that love does is good, and everything that wisdom teaches is truth. From this it is clear that the Divine love is called the Divine good from its effect, which is use; also that the Divine wisdom is called the Divine truth from its effect, which is use. For effect is doing and also teaching, the former having relation to love and the latter to wisdom; also every effect is a use, and use is what is called good and truth; good being the essence of use, and truth its form. It is needless to explain this further and to enlarge upon it, since anyone can see from reason that love is what does and wisdom is what teaches, and that which love does is good and that which wisdom teaches is truth; also that the good that love does is use, and that the truth that wisdom teaches is likewise use. Consider only what love is apart from good in effect, and what good in effect is apart from use, whether the love is anything or whether the good is anything, and you will see it is something in use, consequently that love exists in use. The same is true of wisdom by means of truth; for wisdom teaches and love does. This is why the heat which is from the sun which is the Lord is called the Divine good, and the light from that sun is called the Divine truth.

The Divine wisdom is what is called the Divine providence, and what is called also Divine order, and Divine truths are called the laws of the Divine providence, which have been treated of as above; they are also called the laws of Divine order.

In order, therefore, that the way may be known, the Decalogue shall be explained, which shall be done hereafter.

It is evident that reason can discover that there is a conjunction from the conjunction of affection and thought, in that no one can think without affection; and whoever is willing to investigate may perceive that affection is the life of thought, also that such as the affection is such is the thought, consequently when one burns the other burns, and when one grows cold the other grows cold.

There is a like conjunction of will and understanding, for love is of the will and wisdom is of the understanding. There is a like conjunction of good and truth, because good is of love and truth is of wisdom, as has been shown in the preceding article. On this conjunction see what has been set forth in New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine (n. 11–27). 116. That the conjunction is reciprocal may also be concluded from affection and thought, in that affection produces thought and thought reproduces the affection. But it can be concluded especially from the reciprocal conjunction of the heart and lungs, for, as has been shown before (articles 6 and 7), there is a full correspondence in man between the heart and the will, and between the lungs and the understanding; therefore from the conjunction of the heart and lungs we may gain instruction concerning the conjunction of the will and the understanding, and thus concerning the conjunction of love and wisdom. From the parallelism established between the heart and lungs and the will and understanding, it can be seen that: 1. The life of the will conjoins itself to the life of the understanding. 2. The conjunction is reciprocal; and what it is. 3. The life of the understanding purifies the life of the will; and also perfects and exalts it. 4. The life of the will cooperates with the life of the understanding in every motion; and on the other hand, the life of the understanding cooperates with the life of the will in every sensation. 5. Likewise in sound and in its speech."

In like manner in the good and in the evil; with the difference that in the evil the life of the will is not purified, perfected, and exalted through the life of the understanding, but is defiled, depraved, and made brutish. 7. Love, which is the life of the will, constitutes the whole life of man. 117. But first it is to be known that by the life of the will love and affection are meant, and by the life of the understanding wisdom, intelligence, and knowledge are meant. It is also to be known that the heart itself, with all its vessels throughout the body, corresponds to the will, and its blood to the love and its affections which constitute the life of the will; also that the lungs, together with the trachea, the larynx, and the glottis, and finally the tongue, correspond to the understanding; and that respiration which is effected by the inflow of air through the larynx and trachea into the bronchia of the lungs, corresponds to the life of the understanding. All this must be known that the truth opened by correspondences may be rightly comprehended. Now, therefore, we proceed to the parallelism. 118. 1. The life of the will conjoins itself to the life of the understanding It is evident from the parallelism that the life of the will, which is love, flows into the understanding and constitutes its inmost life, and that the understanding receives it spontaneously; also that in cooperation the will through the influx of its love into the understanding first produces affections which are proper to the will or love, and then perceptions, and finally thoughts with ideas. That this is so can be seen from the conjunction of the heart with the lungs. The heart sends all its blood into the lungs through its right auricle and makes its vessels to be full of blood, and from this the lungs from being white take the color of the blood. The heart sends its blood through a covering or outmost coat called the pericardium, and this coat encompasses the vessels even to the inmost parts of the lungs.

Respiration takes place by the influx of air into the bronchia, and by their reciprocal motions or breathings. 119. 2. The conjunction is reciprocal; and what it is From the parallelism it can be seen that the understanding sends back the life of love received from the will, yet not by the same way by which it receives it, but by another towards the sides; and that the will thus makes the life active in the entire body. But this reciprocal conjunction can be more fully comprehended from the reciprocal conjunction of the heart and lungs, because they are similar. The heart, as has been said above, sends the blood into the lungs through its right auricle, and the lungs send back what is so received into the left auricle of the heart, thus by another way; and the heart from its left ventricle pours it forth with great force in every direction, through the aorta into the body, and through the carotids into the brain; and by these arteries and their ramifications the heart makes life active throughout the body; for to the heart in its arteries the active force belongs. This arterial blood then flows into the veins in every direction, and through these it flows back to the right ventricle of the heart, and from this again as before into the lungs reciprocally. This circulation of the blood is unceasing in every man, because the blood corresponds to the life of the love, and the respiration to the life of the understanding. From what has been said, it is clear that there is a reciprocal conjunction of love and of wisdom, and that love alone is the very life of man. 120. 3. The life of the understanding purifies the life of the will, and also perfects and exalts it That the life of the understanding purifies the life of the will is evident not only from correspondence with the lungs and the heart, but also from this, that man is born into evils from his parents and consequently he loves corporeal and worldly things more than celestial and spiritual things; and therefore his life, which is love, is depraved and impure by nature. Everyone can see from reason that this life cannot be purified except by means of the understanding,"

Consequently there has been given to man the ability to perceive and think affirmatively of things that are contrary to the love of his will, and not only to see that they are true, but also, if he looks to God, he is able to resist them and thereby remove the depraved and filthy things of his will, and thus it is purified. This, too, may be illustrated by the defecation of the blood in the lungs. That the blood poured in from the heart is defecated in the lungs is known to anatomists, from the fact that more blood flows from the heart into the lungs than flows back from the lungs into the heart; also, that it flows in crude and impure, and flows back refined and pure; also, that there is in the lungs a cellular tissue, and into this the blood of the heart excretes its worn out parts, casting them into the little vessels and bronchial branches; also that the mucus in the mouth and the nostrils is partly from that source as also the vapor of the breath. All this makes clear that the feculent blood of the heart is purified in the lungs. By this what has been said just above may be illustrated, since the blood of the heart corresponds to the love of the will, which is the life of man, and the respiration of the lungs corresponds to the perception and thought of the understanding, by means of which purification is effected. 121. The life of the understanding also perfects and exalts the life of the will, because the love of the will, which constitutes the life of man, is purged from evils by means of the understanding, and from being corporeal and worldly man becomes spiritual and celestial, and then the goods and truths of heaven and of the church come to be of his affection and nourish his soul. Thus the life of his will is made new, and the life of his understanding is from that, and thus both are perfected and exalted. This is done in the understanding and by means of it, although from the will, for the will is the man himself. This, too, may be confirmed from the correspondence of the lungs and the heart. The lungs, which correspond to the understanding, not only purge the blood of its feculent matters, as has been said, but also nourish it from the air; for the air is full of volatile elements and odors homogeneous with the material of the blood; and there are also innumerable networks of blood vessels in"

That the atmosphere nourishes the blood in the lungs with new aliments is evident from much experience. For there are currents of air which are harmful to the lungs, and others that refresh them, thus some that are hurtful and some that are wholesome; there are persons afflicted with adipsia who have lived a long time without earthly food, thus upon food drawn from the atmosphere alone; there are species of animals, as bears, vipers, chameleons, and others, that sustain life for a time with no other food. All this makes clear that the blood in the lungs is nourished from the atmosphere. And it is thus according to correspondences that the life of the understanding perfects and exalts the life of the will. 122. 4. The life of the will cooperates with the life of the understanding in every motion; and on the other hand, the life of the understanding cooperates with the life of the will in every sensation It has been shown above that the will and the understanding cooperate in each and in all things of the body, as the heart and lungs do; but it has not yet been shown that the will is the prime agent in producing motions, and that the understanding is the prime agent in presenting sensations. That the will is the prime agent in producing motions follows from its ministration, in that it acts, for doing and acting are from the will; and that the understanding is the prime agent in sensation follows also from its ministration, in that it perceives, and from that experiences sensation. Nevertheless, no motion or sensation can exist without the cooperation of the two. This also appears from the cooperation of the heart and lungs. That the heart is the prime agent and the lungs the secondary is evident from the muscles; in these the arteries act, and the coats of the ligamentous tissue react. The arteries are constricted by fibers incited from the brain, and are relaxed by the coats of overlying ligamentous tissue. The arteries are from the heart; and since the ligamentous tissue is a continuation of the diaphragm or the peritoneum, or from some other source, it"

From this it is clear that in motions the blood of the heart is the prime agent, and the respiration of the lungs the secondary. As the respiration of the lungs is the secondary agent in the muscular tissue by means of the ligamentous tissue which partakes of the motion of the lungs, so this ligamentous tissue constitutes a common sheath for the muscles, and also for the coats of the motor fibers, and thus they enter into their most minute parts; and from this, too, there are reactions, both general and particular; and the particular can be variously multiplied under the general, according to a law of nature that is in force in all things. It is similar with the will and the understanding. But that the lungs are the prime agent in sensation and the heart the secondary is evident from an examination of the organs of the senses, which will confirm this. But since their textures are intricate and various, this cannot be so described here as to be apprehended. It is sufficient to know that all the organs of the senses correspond to such things as pertain to the understanding; for the organ of sight corresponds to intelligence, the organ of hearing to obedience from hearkening, the organ of smell to perception, the tongue to wisdom, and the touch to perception in general. 123. 5. Likewise in sound and in its speech It has been said already that the formations of love from the will in the understanding are first affections, then perceptions, and finally thoughts; and it is known that all sounds are from the lungs, and that there are variations of sounds that derive very little from the understanding, and there are those that derive more, and some derive much. The sounds that derive little from the understanding are those of song and music; those that derive more from the understanding are the interior sounds of speech; those that derive still more from the understanding are the exterior sounds of speech; speech itself manifests the things of the understanding by means of the articulations of sounds that are words.

This is perceived clearly by angels, but obscurely by men. The correspondence of the sound itself is with the general affection of love in the understanding. The correspondence of the variations of sound, like those of song and music, is with variations of the affections that are from the love of the will in the understanding. The correspondence of the variations of sound that derive but little from the understanding is with perception; those that derive more is with the variation of perceptions; and the correspondence of those that derive much is with thought and its variations; and the ideas of thought correspond with the words. This in brief. There are two lungs that are called lobes; the fountains of their respiration are called bronchia; the channel in which they close is called the trachea, or the rough artery; the head of the trachea is called the larynx, and the opening for sound there is called the glottis; there is a continuation therefrom into the nostrils and the tongue; and an exit through the opening of the lips. All these in one complex belong to the lungs, to their respiration and to their sound making, and taken together they correspond to the understanding from the will, their sound making to the understanding, and their motions to the will. 124. 6. This is done with the good and with the evil, with the difference, that with the evil the life of the will is not purified, perfected, and exalted through the life of the understanding, but is defiled, depraved, and made brutish Every man has a will and an understanding, and there is a reciprocal conjunction of the will and the understanding alike with the evil and with the good. But the love of the will and consequently also the wisdom of the understanding differs with each individual, and this to such an extent that with the good and with the evil they are opposite. With the good there is the love of good and the understanding of truth therefrom, but with the evil there is the love of evil and the understanding of falsity therefrom."

In externals there appears to be a likeness, because externals simulate and counterfeit, but in internals there is unlikeness. But how the matter really is can be fully illustrated by the correspondence of the heart and lungs. Everyone has a heart and lungs; and with everyone there is a reciprocal conjunction of the heart with the lungs, and with everyone the blood of the heart is dephlegmated in the lungs, and is nourished by volatile elements and odors from the air, and yet in a wholly different way with the good and with the evil. What the dephlegmation is, and what the nourishment of the blood is, in the lungs with the good and with the evil, can be concluded from the following examples of experience. In the spiritual world a good spirit draws to his nostrils with delight all kinds of fragrant and sweet odors, and abhors putrid and bad odors; but an evil spirit draws to his nostrils with delight putrid and bad odors of all kinds, and shuns fragrant and sweet odors. This is why in the hells there are foul, disgusting, dungy, and cadaverous smells, and other like things, and this because every odor corresponds to the perception that is from the affection of one’s love. The reverse is true in the heavens. From all this it is clear that with man in this world, the blood, by means of the air, is nourished by like substances as being homogeneous, and is purged of unlike substances as being heterogeneous. The human blood is spiritual in its inmosts, and corporeal in its outmosts; consequently those who are spiritual nourish the blood from such things in nature as correspond to things spiritual; while those who are merely natural nourish it from such things in nature as correspond to the natural. This is why the unlikeness of the blood in men is such, and is as great as is the unlikeness of their loves, for the blood corresponds to the love, as is evident from what has been said above."

Love, which is the life of the will, constitutes the whole life of man It is believed that thought constitutes the whole life of man; but it is love. It is so believed because thought appears to man, and love does not. If you take away love, or any stream of it that is called affection, you cease to think, grow cold, and die; but not when you take away thought only, as when the memory fails, or in sleep, in swoons, in suffocation, or in the womb; although in these conditions the thought ceases, yet life goes on as long as the heart beats, for the heart corresponds to the love. It is the same with the will and the understanding, for love pertains to the will, and thought to the understanding. 126. That love constitutes the whole life of man has been made clear in the foregoing pages from the correspondence of the heart with the lungs, and it has been shown from that correspondence that as in the womb the heart forms the lungs, in order that respiration may be accomplished thereby, and thus speech be produced, so love forms the understanding, that it may thereby think and from thought may speak. It has also been thus shown that love produces from itself affections, and from these come intentions, through these perception, from which come lights, and through perception thought from which are ideas, and from these memory; also that these taken together make up the love’s understanding, and to these in a like series all things of the lungs correspond. 127. And as the love has formed the understanding for the use of thought and of speech, so it has formed the other functions of life for their uses, some for the use of nourishment, some for the uses of chyle making and blood making; some for the uses of procreation, some for the uses of sensation, some for the uses of action and of locomotion; and in all of these nothing but the former itself, which is love, can make the life to act.

Anyone who can investigate will see that there are similar progressions of uses from first to last in these things as in the lungs. From all this and from what precedes it is clear that the love of the will constitutes the whole life of man, and that the life of the understanding is from the will, consequently that man is his love, and his understanding is from that love and according to it. 11 Love to the Lord from the Lord exists in charity, and wisdom in faith 128. Those who think only naturally and do not at the same time think spiritually concerning love to the Lord and concerning charity towards the neighbor, do not think otherwise, because they are unable to think otherwise, than that the Lord is to be loved as to the person, and also that the neighbor is to be loved as to the person; but those who think both naturally and spiritually, perceive and from perception think that both an evil man as well as a good man can love the Lord as to the person, and the neighbor likewise can be loved as to the person; and that if an evil man loves he cannot be loved in return; but that if a good man loves he can be loved in return. Therefore the spiritual-natural man concludes that to love the Lord is to love that which is from him, which in itself is Divine, in which the Lord is; and that this is doing good to the neighbor; and that thus and in no other way can one be loved by the Lord and be conjoined to him through love. But in respect to this matter the natural man is unable to reflect upon its spiritual principles until they are presented before him in a distinct manner. Therefore they shall be distinctly presented under the following heads: LOVE AND CHARITY 1. The love of uses is charity. 2. The Lord is the source [a quo], and the neighbor is the object [ad quem]."

The conjunction of charity and faith is reciprocal. LOVE AND CHARITY 129. 1. The love of uses is charity In each and every thing there are these three, end, cause, and effect; the end is that from which, the cause is that by means of which, and the effect is that in which; and when the end by means of the cause is in the effect, it then exists. In every love and its affection there is an end, and the end intends or wills to do what it loves, and the thing done is its effect. The Lord is the end from which, man is the cause by means of which, and the use is the effect in which the end exists. The Lord is the end from which, because from his Divine love he perpetually intends or wills to do uses, that is, to do good to the human race. Man is the cause by means of which, because he is or can be in the love of uses; and in that love he intends or wills to do uses; and uses are the effects in which the end exists; and uses are what are called goods. From this it is clear that the love of uses is the charity that man should have toward the neighbor. 130. That in each and all things there is an end, a cause, and an effect, may be explored from anything whatever; as when a man is doing anything he says either to himself or to another, or another to him, Why are you doing this, that is, What is the end? Also, How will you do this, that is, By what cause? Also, What are you doing, that is, What will the effect be?

So of the Lord; as he is the end, he is everything in the love of uses or charity with man, consequently is everything in the uses done by man, that is, in the uses done through man. From this it is believed in the church that all good is from God and nothing of it is from man, and that God is good itself. It follows, therefore, as a consequence that doing charity is doing uses, or the goods that are uses, thus that the love of uses is charity. 131. 2. The Lord is the source [a quo] and the neighbor is the object [ad quem] It is clear from what has been said above that it is from the Lord that the love of uses or charity is and exists. The neighbor is the one for whom, since the neighbor is the object towards whom charity is to be cherished, and to whom charity is to be manifested. As it is said that the neighbor is the object (ad quem), it shall be told what and who the neighbor is. In a broad sense the neighbor is the general or public good; in a more limited sense it means the church, one’s country, a society greater or less; and in a restricted sense it means a fellow citizen, a companion, and a brother. To perform uses to any of these from love is to exercise charity towards the neighbor, for these are loved when this is done. These are then loved because love of uses and love of the neighbor cannot be separated. A man may, indeed, from love of uses or from charity do good to an enemy or to an evil man; but to such he performs the uses of repentance or of reconciliation, and these uses are various, and are accomplished by various methods (see Matt. 5:25, 43–44 seq.; Luke 6:27–28, 35). 132. 3. Love to the Lord exists in charity, because it exists in use This the Lord himself teaches in John: He that hath my commandments and doeth them, he it is who loveth me. If anyone love me he will keep my word. He that loveth me not keepeth not my words (John 14:21, 23–24)."

To keep his precepts, words, and commandments, is to do the goods of charity, which are uses to the neighbor. In the same: Three times Jesus said to Peter, Lovest thou me? And three times Peter replied that he loved him. Three times Jesus said, Feed my lambs and my sheep (John 21:15–17). “Feeding lambs and sheep” are the uses or goods of charity with those who preach the gospel and love the Lord. This makes clear that love to the Lord exists in charity, since it exists in use; also that the conjunction of love to the Lord with charity towards the neighbor, and thus the conjunction of the Lord with man, is in use; and that the conjunction is such and as great as is the love of use, for the Lord is in use as he is in the good that is from him, and the man who is in the love of use is in use as if from himself, and yet he acknowledges that it is not from him, but is from the Lord. For man cannot love the Lord from himself, nor can he love uses from himself; but the Lord loves man and reciprocates his own love in him and makes it to appear to him as if he loved the Lord from himself. This, then, is love of the Lord from the Lord. And from this it is clear how love to the Lord exists in charity, that is, in the love of uses. 133. 4. Use is to perform one’s office and to do one’s work rightly, faithfully, sincerely, and justly It is only known obscurely and only by some what is really meant in the Word by the goods of charity, which are called “good works,” also “fruits,” and here uses. From the sense of the letter of the Word it is believed that they consist in giving to the poor, assisting the needy, doing good to widows and orphans, and like things. But such uses are not meant in the Word by “fruits,” “works,” and goods of charity; but it means performing one’s office, business, and work rightly, faithfully, sincerely, and justly."

For when this is done everyone, whether he be a priest, governor or officer, a merchant, or a laborer, is every day doing uses; a priest by preaching, a governor or officer by his administrative work, a merchant by trading, and a laborer by his work. As for example, a judge who judges rightly, faithfully, sincerely, and justly, is doing uses to the neighbor as often as he judges; a minister in like manner as often as he teaches; so in other instances. 134. That such uses are meant by the goods of charity and by “works” is evident from the Lord’s government in the heavens. In the heavens as in the world, all are engaged in some function or service, or in some office or work; and every individual enjoys magnificence, wealth, and happiness, according to his fidelity, sincerity and justice therein. One who is lazy and slothful is not admitted into heaven, but is cast out either into hell, or into a desert place where he lives in want and misery. Such things in the heavens are called goods of charity, works and uses. Everyone who has been faithful, sincere and just in his employment and work in the world is faithful, sincere, and just when he has left the world; and he is received in heaven by the angels; and everyone has heavenly joy according to the quality of his faithfulness, sincerity, and justice; and for the reason that a mind devoted to its employment and work from the love of use is held together, and is then in spiritual delight, which is the delight of fidelity, sincerity, and justice, and is withheld from the delight of fraud and malice, also from the delight of idle conversation and feasting, which is the delight of idleness; and idleness is the devil’s pillow. Everyone can see that the Lord cannot dwell in the love of these; but he can dwell in the love of the former. 135. 5.

But besides these there are other general uses, as faithfully loving the marriage partner, rightly bringing up children, managing the home prudently, and dealing justly with servants. These works become works of charity when they are done from the love of uses; and in reference to a marriage partner when they are done from mutual and chaste love; such uses are household uses which are uses of charity. There are still other general uses, such as contributing proper offerings and dues to the ministry of the church, and such good works become uses of charity so far as the church is loved as the neighbor in a higher degree. Again, among general uses may be included the expenditure of means and labor for building and maintaining orphanages, houses for the reception of strangers, gymnasia, and other like institutions, some of which are matters of indifference. To give aid to the needy, to widows, to orphans, solely because they are needy, widows and orphans, and to give to beggars solely because they are beggars, are uses of external charity, which charity is called piety; but these are uses of internal charity only so far as they are derived from use and the love of use. For external charity without internal charity is not charity; the internal must be there to make it charity; for external charity from internal charity acts prudently, but external without internal charity acts imprudently, and often unjustly. 136. 6. Uses become uses of charity only with one who fights against evils, which are from hell For the uses that a man does so long as he is in hell, that is, so long as the love that makes his life is in hell and from hell, are not uses of charity, for they have nothing in common with heaven, and the Lord is not in them. The love of a man’s life is in hell and from hell so long as he has not fought against evils, which are in hell and from hell.

And then will I profess unto them, I know ye not; depart from me, ye workers of iniquity (Matt. 7:22–23). And such as are done under a show of piety are thus described in Luke: Then shall ye begin to say, We did eat before thee and drink, and thou didst teach in our streets.

That this is true has been made evident to me by very many experiences. These uses are such within the man who does them. And yet out of the man they are uses, and are stirred up by the Lord with man for the sake of the general and the particular good; but they are not done from the Lord, and in consequence they are not rewarded in heaven, but are rewarded or will be rewarded in the world. 138. 8.

This is why faith has come to mean that which a man believes and does not see; therefore it is said that this or that is to be believed, and it is seldom said, “I do not see,” but it is said, “I believe.” Thus no one knows whether what he believes is true or false. So the blind leads the blind, and both fall into the pit. It is acknowledged, indeed, that faith is nothing else than truth when it is said that truth is of faith, and that faith is of truth. But when it is asked whether this or that is a truth the answer is, “It is a matter of faith,” and no further inquiry is made. Thus with the eyes shut and the understanding closed, everything believed where one is born is accepted as a truth of faith. Such blindness was never called faith by the ancients; but their faith was what they could acknowledge to be true from some light in the thought. This is why in the Hebrew language truth and faith are expressed by a single term, amen or amuna. 140. 2. Truth becomes truth when it is perceived and loved, and it is called faith when it is known and thought The defenders of faith separate wish to be believed when they say that spiritual things cannot be comprehended by the human understanding because they transcend it; and yet they do not deny enlightenment. This enlightenment, which they do not deny, is what is here meant by perception, thus by the statement that truth becomes truth when it is perceived and loved. And yet it is the love of truth that causes the truth perceived to become truth, for that is what gives life. Enlightenment is that perception because all truth is in light, and into that light the understanding of man can be"

All truth is in light because the light that proceeds from the Lord as a sun is truth itself; and for this reason all truth in heaven shines, and the Word, which is the Divine truth, gives to the angels in heaven their common light, therefore also the Lord is called “the Word” and “the Light” (John 1:1–3). 141. It has been granted me to know by much experience that the human understanding can be elevated into that light, even the understanding of those who have no love of truth, but have only a desire for knowing, or who are in an affection for glory therefrom; but with the difference that those that have a love of truth are actually in the light of heaven, and for that reason have enlightenment and perception of truth when they read the Word; while others have no enlightenment and perception of truth, but only a confirmation of their own principles, and they do not know whether these are true or false; and with the further difference that those who have a love of truth, when they read the Word and think from it, keep the sight of their understanding constantly on the principle itself, and thus seek to know whether it is true before it is confirmed. But the others, from the knowledge in their memory, assume a principle, not wishing to know whether it is true, and if they desire a reputation for learning they confirm the principle by means of the Word and the reason. The genius of learning, which is self-conceit, is such that it can confirm any falsity, even so as to make it appear to themselves and to others to be true. This is the source of heresies, dissensions, and the defense of discordant dogmas in the church. And from this comes the difference that those who have a love of truth are wise and become spiritual, but the others remain natural and are insane in things spiritual. Truth is called faith when it is known and thought, because a truth perceived becomes afterwards a matter of memory which is believed. And from this it is clear that faith is nothing else than truth. 142. 3.

That man may be separated from the devil and hell and be conjoined to the Lord and heaven, he must know what evils are and what falsities from them are, because these are the devil and hell; and he must know what goods are and what truths from them are, because these are the Lord and heaven. Evils and falsities are the devil and hell because they are therefrom, and goods and truths are the Lord and heaven because they are therefrom. Unless a man knows goods and truths and evils and falsities he sees no way of egress from hell, and no way of entrance into heaven; these are what truths must teach, and the truths that teach have been given to man in the Word and from the Word; and as the way to heaven or to hell is from the world, and as man’s life is in the world and with the neighbor there, therefore that life is the way that truths teach. For this reason if a man’s life is according to the truths of the Word, the way to hell and from hell is closed, and the way to the Lord and from the Lord is opened, and the man’s life becomes the life of the Lord with him. This is what is meant by the Lord’s words in John: I am the way, the truth, and the life (John 14:6). On the other hand, if a man’s life is contrary to the truths of the Word, the way from heaven and to heaven is closed, and the way to hell and from hell is opened, and the man’s life becomes not life but death. It has been said above respecting charity that the Lord’s life with man is a life of charity towards the neighbor, and that conjunction is in the love of uses; and as truths teach that life, it is evident that they look on the one hand to the Lord, and on the other to the neighbor. 143. 4.

It is known that man from himself can do nothing good that is good in itself, but he can do this from the Lord, consequently he can perform no use that in itself is use, for use is good. From this it follows that the Lord does every use that is good by means of man. It has been shown elsewhere that the Lord wills that man should do good as if from himself; but how man is to do good as if from himself is also taught by the truths of the Word, and as this is taught by truths it is clear that truths are matters of knowledge and thought, and that goods are matters of willing and doing; thus that truths become goods through willing and doing; for what a man wills and does he calls good, and what a man knows and thinks he calls truth; so in the deed, thus in good, there is willing and thinking and knowing. Consequently the complex of these in the ultimate is good; and this has in itself an external form from truths in the thought and an internal form from the love of the will. But how the Lord performs uses in man which are goods has been told and shown in the explanation of the laws of his Divine providence. 144. 5.

(1) What spiritual truths, moral truths, and civil truths are. Spiritual truths are those that the Word teaches respecting God—that he is the one creator of the universe; that he is infinite, eternal, omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent, provident; that the Lord as to the human is his Son; that God the creator and the Lord are one; that he is the redeemer, the reformer, the regenerator, and savior; that he is the Lord of heaven and earth; that he is the Divine love and Divine wisdom; that he is good itself and truth itself; that he is life itself; that everything of love, of charity, and of good, also everything of wisdom, of faith, and of truth, is from him, and nothing of these is from man; therefore that no man has merit"

These and like things are properly spiritual truths. But moral truths are those that the Word teaches respecting the life of man with his neighbor, which life is called charity. The goods of this life, which are uses, have relation, in brief, to justice and equity, to sincerity and uprightness, to chastity, to temperance, to truth, to prudence, and to benevolence. To the truths of moral life belong also the opposites which destroy charity, and which have relation, in brief, to injustice and inequity, to insincerity and fraud, to lasciviousness, to intemperance, to lying, to cunning, to enmity, to hatred and revenge, and to ill will. These latter are called truths of moral life, because all things that a man thinks to be true, whether evil or good, he classes among truths; for that this thing is evil or that thing is good he speaks of as a truth. These are moral truths; but civil truths are the civil laws of kingdoms and states, which have relation, in brief, to many phases of justice that are observed, and on the contrary to the various kinds of violence that exist in act. 145. (2) The spiritual man is also a moral and a civil man. It is believed by many that the spiritual are those who know the spiritual truths enumerated above, and especially those who talk about them, and still more those who perceive them with some understanding. But such are not spiritual, for this is merely knowing, and thinking and speaking from knowledge, and perceiving from a gift of understanding that every man has, and these things alone do not make a man spiritual. There is lacking from these love from the Lord; and love from the Lord is the love of uses which is called charity. In charity the Lord conjoins himself to man and makes him spiritual, for man then performs uses from the Lord and not from himself. This the Lord teaches in many places in the Word, and thus in John:"

I am the vine, ye are the branches; he that abideth in me and I in him, the same beareth much fruit; for apart from me ye cannot do anything (John 15:4–5). “Fruits” are uses or goods of charity; and goods of charity are nothing else than moral goods. This makes clear that a spiritual man is also a moral man. A moral man is also a civil man, because civil laws are uses themselves in act, which are called practices, works, and deeds. 146. Take for example the seventh8 commandment of the Decalogue, “Thou shalt not steal.” The spiritual meaning in this commandment is that a man must not take anything from the Lord and attribute it to himself and call it his, also must not take away from anyone the truths of his faith by means of falsities. The moral meaning in this commandment is that man must not deal insincerely, unjustly, and fraudulently with his neighbor, or cunningly take away his wealth. The civil meaning in the commandment is that a man must not steal. Who cannot see that the man who is led by the Lord, and who is thereby a spiritual man, is also a moral and a civil man? 147. Again, take the fifth9 commandment, “Thou shalt not kill.” The spiritual meaning in this commandment is that man must not deny God, thus the Lord; for to deny him is to kill and crucify him with oneself; also he must not destroy spiritual life in another, for thus he kills his soul. The moral meaning in the commandment is that man must not hate his neighbor, or desire to have revenge, since hatred and revenge have murder in them. The civil meaning in the commandment is that another’s body must not be killed. From this also it is clear that a spiritual man, who is one that is led by the Lord, is also a moral and a civil man. This is not true of one who is led by himself, of whom something shall be said presently. 148. (3). The spiritual is in the moral and the civil. This follows from what has been said above that the Lord conjoins himself with man in the love of uses, or in charity towards the neighbor. The spiritual is from conjunction with the Lord; the moral is from"

The spiritual must be in man that he may be saved; and this is from the Lord, not above or outside of man but within him; it cannot be in man’s knowledge alone or from that in his thought and speech; it must be in his life, and his life is willing and doing; consequently when knowing and thinking are also willing and doing the spiritual is in the moral and in the civil. If it be asked, “How can I will and do?” the answer is, Fight against evils, which are from hell, and you will both will and do, not from yourself but from the Lord, for when evils are put away the Lord does all things. 149. (4). If these are separated there is no conjunction with the Lord. This can be seen from reason and from experience. From reason: If a man had such a memory and such an understanding as to be able to know and perceive all the truths of heaven and of the church, but was unwilling to do any of them, is it not said of him that he is an intelligent man but an evil man, yea all the more he should be punished? From this it follows that he who separates the spiritual from the moral and the civil is not a spiritual man or a moral man or a civil man. From experience: There are such persons in the world, and I have talked with them after death, and have learned that they knew all things of the Word and many truths therefrom, and believed that on this account they would shine as stars in heaven; but when their life was examined it was found to be merely corporeal and worldly, and from the evils and propensities they had thought and purposed in themselves they were merely infernal. For this reason all the things they had known from the Word were taken away from them, and they became each his own will, and were cast into hell to their like, where they talked insanely according to their thoughts in the world, and acted basely according to their loves in the world. 150. 6. Faith is to know and think these truths; and charity is to will and do them It has been shown above that truth is called faith when man knows and thinks it; it shall now be shown that truth becomes charity when man wills and does it.

Truth is also like a garment, which apart from man is merely a piece of cloth fitted to the body, but when it is put on it becomes clothing in which is a man. It is the same with truth and charity. So long as truth is known and thought it is merely truth, and is called faith; but when a man wills and does it, it becomes charity, just as a seed becomes a plant or a tree, or a piece of cloth becomes clothing in which is a man. 151. Moreover, knowledge and thought therefrom are two faculties distinct from the will and the act therefrom, and they may be separated; for a man may know and think many things that he does not will and thus does not do. When these are separated they do not constitute the life of man; when they are conjoined they do constitute it. It is the same with faith and charity. All this can be made more clear by comparisons. In the world light and heat are two distinct things, which may be separated or may be conjoined; in the winter season they are separated, in the summer season they are conjoined. When separated they do not produce vegetable life, that is, they do not produce anything; but when conjoined they do produce and bring forth. Again, the lungs and the heart in man are two distinct things whose motions may be separated or may be conjoined. They are separated in swooning and suffocation; and when separated they do not constitute the life of man’s body, but when conjoined they do constitute it. It is the same with man’s knowledge and thought therefrom to which faith pertains, and with will and deed to which charity pertains, the lungs and also light correspond to faith therefrom, and the heart and also heat correspond to the will and to charity therefrom. From all this it can be seen that in faith separated from charity there is no more of life than in knowing and thinking separated from willing and doing; in this the only life is that man wills to think, and makes himself speak and believe accordingly."

Therefore when the Divine love of the Lord exists with man in charity, which is to will and do truths, the Divine wisdom of the Lord with man exists in faith, which is to know and think truths What is meant by the Divine love of the Lord and what by his Divine wisdom has been told above; charity and faith and the conjunction of the Lord in the love of uses, which is charity with man, have also been defined; now the conjunction of the Lord with the faith that is with man shall be treated of. The Lord conjoins himself with man in charity and from charity in faith, but not in faith and from faith in charity. The reason is that the conjunction of the Lord with man is in the love of man’s will, which makes his life, thus in charity, which makes his spiritual life. From this the Lord gives life to the truths of thought, which are called truths of faith, and conjoins them to the life. The first truths with man, which are called faith, are not yet living truths, for they are only in the memory and in thought and speech from the memory, adjoined to man’s natural love, which is led to imbibe them by its craving to know; and by its craving for a reputation for knowledge and learning it calls them forth into thought or speech. But these truths begin to be living truths when man is regenerating, and this is effected by a life according to them, and such a life is charity. Then man’s spiritual mind is opened, in which a conjunction of the Lord with man is effected, and thus the truths of man’s infancy, childhood, and early youth are made alive. Also a conjunction is effected of the Divine love and wisdom with charity in man, and of the Divine wisdom and the Divine love in the faith in him, making charity and faith to be one in man, as the Divine love and Divine wisdom are one in the Lord. But on this more will be said in the explanation of the Decalogue. 153. 8. The conjunction of charity and faith is reciprocal. This has been explained above, where the reciprocal conjunction of love and wisdom was treated of, and has been illustrated by its correspondence with the reciprocal conjunction of the heart and lungs."

The mind that thinks from the eye thinks that it was created by nature; but the mind that does not think from the eye thinks that it is from God; while the mind that takes the middle path thinks that it is from an entity of which it has no idea, for it perceives that something cannot exist from nothing.

Now, that it may be perceived and thus known that all things were created by God, who is the Lord from eternity, the Divine love itself and the Divine wisdom itself, thus life itself, it will be well to proceed by distinct steps; and this shall be done in the following order: 1.

The Lord is the sun in the angelic heaven This has been hitherto unknown, because it has not been known that there is a spiritual world distinct from the natural world and above that world, and that the two have nothing in common except as what is prior is related to what is posterior, or cause is to effect. Therefore it has not been known what the spiritual is, or that in that world there are angels and spirits, both of whom are men in every respect like men in the world, with this difference only, that they are spiritual and men are natural. Also that all things there are from a spiritual origin only, while all things in this world are from both a spiritual and a natural origin. And as these things have not been known it has also been unknown that the light and heat that angels and spirits have is different from the light and heat that men have; also that light and heat in the spiritual world derive their essence from the sun there, as our light and heat derive their essence from our sun; therefore the essence of light and heat from their sun is spiritual, while the essence of light and heat from our sun is natural, to which, however, a spiritual from their sun has been joined, which enlightens man’s understanding when the natural enlightens his eye. 156.

From this it now follows that the sun of the spiritual world in its being [esse] is God, who is the Lord from eternity, and that the heat from that sun is love, and the light from that sun is wisdom.

There are other reasons why it was not revealed before, but they cannot be presented here. When once it has been made known that angels and spirits are men, who live together like men in the world, and that they are entirely above nature, while men are within nature, it can reasonably be concluded that they have another sun, and that that sun is the source from which everything of love and everything of wisdom, and thus everything of truly human life, has its origin. That that sun has been seen by me, and also the Lord in it, may be seen in Heaven and Hell (n. 116–140); and in Earths in the Universe (n. 40–42). 157. 2. That the sun is the origin of all things No one can think that the universe is from eternity and that it is from nothing; therefore no one can deny that it has been created, and created by somebody, and that the creator is being itself, infinite and eternal in itself, love itself, wisdom itself, and life itself; and that there is a common center from which he views, rules, and provides all things as present, with which center there must be conjunction, and according to the conjunction there will be the life of love and wisdom and blessedness and happiness; also that that center appears before the angels as a fiery and flaming sun, and that that appearance is from the Divine love and the Divine wisdom that proceed from him from which everything spiritual exists, and through the spiritual by means of the sun of the world, everything natural. The human mind from its understanding, which can be raised up, if it wishes, into truths of light, can see that the universe has been created by God, who is such and who is one. 158. Since, therefore, there are two suns, a sun of the spiritual world and a sun of the natural world, and the sun of the spiritual world looks from its firsts to ultimates, and the sun of the natural world looks from the middle to ultimates, it is clear that the sun of the spiritual world (in which is God, and which is from God, who is life itself) is the source of all things that have been made and"

Consequently to acknowledge nature, which in itself is dead, is to adore the fire which is in the sun of the world; and those who do this are dead. But to acknowledge life as the creator is to adore God, who is in the sun of heaven; and those who do this are living. Those are called dead men who are in hell, but those are called living men who are in heaven. 159. 3. From that sun the Lord is everywhere present In the church it is known from the Word that the Lord has omnipresence; and it has been told already what is meant by his omnipresence, and what it is. It shall now be told how this can be comprehended. It can be comprehended from the correspondence of the sun of the world with the sun of heaven, and therefore the correspondence of nature with life, which correspondence serves also for comparison. Everyone knows that the sun of this world is everywhere in its world, and that its presence exists by means of light and heat. This presence is such that the sun is seemingly in these, although it is at a distance. The difference is that the heat which it sends forth is fire in its origin, and that the light which it sends forth is flame therefrom in its origin, also that all things that have been created by means of that sun are recipients of it, more or less perfect according to forms and distances. Consequently all things in the natural world increase in the measure of their sun’s presence, and decrease in the measure of its absence. They increase as heat makes one with its light; they decrease as heat does not make one with its light. But this sun thus operates into things that are beneath it, which are called natural things, while it is wholly inoperative in those things that are above it, that are called spiritual. For to operate into lower things is according to order; while to operate into higher things is contrary to order, because this would be operating into the things that it is from; while to operate into lower things is according to order because this is operating into things that are from it. The sun of heaven is that from which is the sun of the world, and spiritual things are those from which are"

The presence of the sun of heaven is universal, not only in the spiritual world where angels and spirits are, but also in the natural world where men are; for men receive the love of their will and the wisdom of their understanding from no other source. Without that sun no animal could live, nor could any plant exist. See what has been said about this and explained above. The presence of that sun also exists by means of heat and light; but its heat in its essence is love, and its light in its essence is wisdom; and to these the light and heat of the sun of the world give supplementary aid, by adding that by means of which they exist in nature and subsist there. But the presence of the sun of heaven by means of spiritual heat and light differs from the presence of the sun of the world, which is by means of natural heat and light, in that the presence of the sun of heaven is universal and dominant both in the spiritual world and the natural world, while the presence of the sun of the world is especially for the natural world, and in that world is a servant; also that the presence of the sun of heaven is not in the extension of space and time, while the presence of the sun of the world is in these, for the extension of space and time was created with nature. This is why the presence of the sun of heaven is omnipresence. 161. The presence of the sun of heaven regarded in itself is constant; for the sun of heaven is always in its rising and in its power. But with recipients, who are chiefly angels, spirits, and men, it is inconstant and not in its power, for it is varied according to reception. The sun of the world corresponds to the sun of heaven in that it, too, is constant in its place and in its potency, but in the earth, which is its recipient, it becomes inconstant and not in its potency, for it is varied according to the revolutions of the earth about its axis, which make days and nights, and according to the revolutions of the earth around the sun, which make springs, summers, autumns, and winters. From all this the correspondence of the natural things of the world with the spiritual things of heaven is evident."

All things that have been created were created for obedient service to life itself, which is the Lord Something shall be said first about life, and afterwards about the creation of all things for obedient service to life. Life is love and wisdom, for so far as a man through wisdom loves God, and the neighbor, so far he lives. But life itself, which is the life of all things, is the Divine love and the Divine wisdom. The Divine love is the being of life, and the Divine wisdom is its existence; and the reciprocal union of these is the Lord. Both the Divine being and the Divine existence are infinite and eternal, for the Divine love is infinite and eternal and the Divine wisdom is infinite and eternal. And yet both of these may have conjunction with angel and with man, although there is no possible ratio between the finite and the infinite. But since it is difficult to comprehend how there can be any conjunction when there can be no ratio, this shall be explained. There is no ratio between the natural and the spiritual, but there is conjunction by means of correspondences. Nor is there any ratio between the spiritual in which the angels of the lowest heaven are with the celestial in which the angels of the highest heaven are, but there is conjunction by correspondences. Neither can there be any ratio between the celestial in which the angels of the highest heaven are and the Divine of the Lord, but there can be conjunction by"

The Divine is infinite and eternal because it is the all in all of the life of love and wisdom with angels and with men. Angels and men have been created recipients of life from the Lord, thus finite; while the Lord is uncreate, in himself life, and thus life itself. If, therefore, men should be multiplied, and from them angels and spirits, to eternity, still the Lord gives them life, and from himself leads them in the most minute particulars, as may be seen confirmed above, where his Divine providence was treated of. In this is the eternal, and where the eternal is there is the infinite. Since there is no ratio between the infinite and the finite, let everyone take heed not to think of the infinite as of nothing. The infinite and eternal cannot be predicated of nothing, neither can conjunction with anything be predicated of nothing, neither is anything made from nothing. But the infinite and eternal Divine is being itself; from which the finite is created, and with which there can be conjunction. But this might be made fully clear to many by a comparison of natural things with spiritual, between which there can be no ratio, but there can be conjunction by correspondences. Such is the relation of every cause to its effect; such is the relation between what is prior and what is posterior; such is the relation between a higher degree and a lower; and such is the relation between the love and wisdom of men and angels. But although the love and wisdom of angels is ineffable and incomprehensible to man, they are both finite, and they are not receptive of the infinite except by correspondences. 164. That all things have been created for obedient service to life, which is the Lord, follows in its order from this, that men, and angels who are from them, have been created to receive life from the Lord, and are nothing but receptacles, although in the freedom in which they are kept by the Lord they do not appear to be receptacles; nevertheless they are so, both the good and the evil; for the freedom in which they are kept is likewise from the Lord. The life of men and angels is to understand, and from that to think and"

All things that have been created in the world have been created for the use, for the benefit, and for the delight of men, some more nearly, some more remotely. Since, then, these things have been created for man’s sake, it follows that they are for the Lord’s service, who is the life with men. It may seem as if these things were serviceable for the good, because they live from the Lord, and not for the evil; nevertheless, created things furnish uses, benefit, and delight, both to the evil and the good, for the Lord says that: He makes his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust (Matt. 5:45). That the evil have nothing of life from themselves, and that they are led by the Lord, although they are ignorant of it and are unwilling to be led, may be seen in the passages where the life of those that are in hell is treated of. 165. 5. Souls of life, and living souls, and plant souls, are animated by the life that is from the Lord, by means of uses and according to uses. By souls of life men and angels are meant; by living souls animals are meant, which are called in the Word “living souls”; and by plant souls trees and plants of every kind are meant. That souls of life, that is, men and angels, are animated by the life that is from the Lord, has been shown in the preceding pages. That living souls or animals are animated by means of life from the Lord has been also shown from the Lord in the preceding pages. The same is true of plant souls, for these souls are uses which are ultimate effects of life; and living souls are affections of various kinds corresponding to the life of those who are in the spiritual world, from which correspondence they might be called mediate lives. Animation means not only that they live, but also that they have being and exist. They are continually animated, that is, have life, being, and existence from the Lord; because when creation has once been completed it is made continuous by means of influx from the sun of heaven. And unless this influx were continuous all things would perish, for apart from this influx the influx of the sun of the world"

There is a correspondence of heat and its effect with the life of the Lord’s love, and there is a correspondence of light and its effect with the life of the Lord’s wisdom, for the Divine love proceeding from the sun of heaven is heat in the spiritual world, and the Divine wisdom proceeding from that sun is light there. To these the heat and light of the sun of the world correspond, for everything is a correspondence. 166. But how the Lord from his Divine love and Divine wisdom, which are life itself, flows in and animates the created universe, shall be told in a few words. The Divine proceeding is that about the Lord that appears to the angels as a sun. From this his Divine proceeds through spiritual atmospheres which he had created for the conveyance of light and heat even to the angels, and which he had adapted to the life both of their minds and of their bodies, that they might receive intelligence from the light and might see, and also according to correspondence might breathe, for angels, like men, breathe; also that they might receive love from the heat and might have sensation, and according to correspondence their heart might beat, for the angels like men enjoy pulsation of the heart. These spiritual atmospheres increase in density by discrete degrees (which have been treated of above), even to the angels of the lowest heaven, to whom they become adapted. Because of this the angels of the highest heaven live as in a pure aura, the angels of the middle heaven as it were in an ether, and the angels of the lowest heaven as it were in air. Underlying these atmospheres in each heaven are the lands where the angels dwell, where they have their palaces and houses, also paradisal gardens, and cultivated grounds, rose gardens and lawns, which exist anew every morning, with everything in them according to the reception by the angels of love and wisdom from the Lord. All these things are from a spiritual origin, and from no natural origin; the spiritual origin is life from the Lord. In correspondence with these all things that appear in the natural world have been created; and for this reason like things exist there, with this difference, that these like the others are from a spiritual origin, but at the same time from a natural origin.

This is the chief and the final end of creation. 167. But a full idea of the creation or of the existence of all things in their order from the life which is the Lord is not possible, because of the arcana, which indeed are known in heaven and have been communicated to me; but as the subject is full of those things which lie deeply hidden in the sciences, it would require volumes to explain them; and even then they would be scarcely comprehensible. The following, however, is a summary of them. The sun of heaven, in which is the Lord, is the common center of the universe; all things of the universe are circumferences beyond circumferences even to the last; these he rules from himself alone as one continuous thing, but the intermediates he rules from the ultimates; these he perpetually animates and makes active, as easily as a man from his understanding and will animates and makes active his body; influx takes place into uses, and from uses into their forms. [Author’s memorandum: Here follows the angelic idea, which may be inserted, or it may be added as an appendix, or in notes.] The angelic idea of the creation of the universe by the Lord 168. The angelic idea of the universe created by the Lord is as follows. God is the center, and he is man; and if God were not man creation would not have been possible; and the Lord from eternity is that God. Of creation: The Lord from eternity, that is, God, by his Divine proceeding created the universe and all things in it; and as the Divine proceeding is life itself, all things have been created from life and by means of life. The Divine proceeding that is nearest to the Lord appears before the angels as a sun; this appears to their sight fiery and flaming; this is so because the Divine proceeding is the Divine love and the Divine wisdom, and these so"

(The angels add that the Divine proceeding is what the ancients represented by golden or shining and pure circles about the head of God, which modern painters still retain from the ancient idea.) They said that from that sun as a great center proceed circles, one after another and one from another even to the last where their end is subsisting in rest. These circles, of which one is from another and one after another, appearing as spread out in breadth and length, are spiritual atmospheres, which are filled with the light and heat from their sun, and through which the light and heat extend themselves to the last circle; and in this last circle by means of these atmospheres, and afterwards by means of the natural atmospheres from the sun of this world, the creation of the earth and all things on it which are for use was accomplished, and this creation is afterwards continued by generations from seeds in wombs or in eggs. The angels who knew that the universe so created was a continuous work from the creator even to ultimates, and that being a continuous work it depends upon the Lord, who is its common center, and is moved and governed by him as a single continuous chain, said that the first which proceeds is continued even to ultimates through discrete degrees, just as an end is continued through causes into effects; or like a producing agent and its products in a continued series; also that the continuation is not only in but also around from the first, and so from everything prior into everything posterior, even to the postreme; and thus that the first and the posterior from it exist together in their order in the postreme or ultimate. From this continuity as a one they have their idea of the Lord, that he is the All in all, that he is omnipotent, omnipresent and omniscient, that he is infinite and eternal; and also their idea of the order according to which the Lord, through his Divine love and Divine wisdom, arranges, provides, and governs all things. It was asked, “Whence, then, is hell?” They said, “From man’s freedom, without which man would not be a man”; that man by that freedom broke the continuity in himself, which being broken a"

[Fragments from the last page of the author’s manuscript.] By means of that heat and that light all things in the spiritual world and all things in the natural world have been created. There are degrees of that heat and light.There are three degrees of that light and heat to the ultimates of the spiritual world, and afterwards three degrees to the ultimates of the natural world. God is the fountain of all uses, celestial, spiritual, and natural.All uses are in God in their very life, thus in their being.Since God is love itself, uses are of his Divine love.

A copy made under the direction of Augustus Nordenskold is now in the possession of the Swedenborg Society, London. The copyist plainly was not skillful in his work; it has very many errors. From this copy these works were first published in Latin, London, 1840. An English translation was published in 1848. They have again been published in Latin, under the editorial care of the present translator, during the year [1885]. For additional particulars, consult Dr. R. L. Tafel’s Documents, number 313 (107, 108). . . . It is plain that these little works were not prepared for publication in their present form. It is also plain that they were not written connectedly, nor without many interruptions. They consist in great part of general statements and propositions for further development, and of hints and memoranda for the author’s guidance when the time should come for their elaboration; and many of these propositions were stated, and memoranda made, several times. Repetitions are therefore frequent; and all is fragmentary. We have here not even a full syllabus or skeleton of a proposed work. But repetition had its use; for it has given us the truth in many aspects. In his revision of the Latin text, the present translator carefully avoided all changes that were not absolutely necessary to a proper sense, and that were not demanded by the author’s constant use of words; and the changes that were made were carefully noted. Several sentences were left almost certainly imperfect, and doubtless differing from the manuscript of the author, through the mistakes of the copier.

One who believes in three can in no wise be saved, but they are saved who believe in one God. (Let this be taken from Athanasius.) Why there is not salvation. 6. If one thinks of the Divine of the Lord in his human, and not of another Divine which they call the Father, the idea of the thought, and thence the faith, does not fall to the left of the Lord, and thus outside of the Lord, but in the Lord; and with the idea is the perception that no one cometh to the Father except through him, thus through his Divine human.

That they so wrote was of the Lord’s Divine providence, lest they should altogether wander away as to the Lord, and thus no one would be saved. 13. They made a distinction among the persons; this was not from the Word; that they made a distinction among three, was from certain passages of the Word, from the sense of its letter not understood; they did not know that in the particular expressions of the Word there is a spiritual sense. 14. There is therefore a trinity, or trine, or triunity, in the Lord—the Divine itself, which is called the Father, the Divine human which is called the Son, and the proceeding Divine which is called the Holy Spirit. 15. That they distinguished between the Divine nature and the human nature was thus because they were in an obscure idea from the sense of the letter of the Word. 16. The cause of the Lord’s saying, “If there be faith, it shall be done,” and this in several places, was, that there might first be implanted in their minds that the Lord is God and is omnipotent; because this is the fundamental of all things of the doctrine of the church. Knowledge precedes with everyone; but still this does not become faith before he lives the life of faith, which is charity; what is before this, belongs to knowledge; for the Lord makes faith from the knowledges with man. 17.

The whole, also, can be harmonized that it may be perceived altogether according to the very expression used in the creed of Athanasius, which is the creed of England; namely, that they adore the trinity in unity and the unity in trinity; for the trinity in unity is then adored, when it is in one, or in one person; and the unity in trinity is then adored, or one person in whom is a trine. 21. That the Lord is called “the Lord Jehovih,” may be seen Isa. 40:10; 52:4; 61:2; (that he is called “Jehovah,”) Ps. 96:2, 13, and throughout the psalm. 22. Who can conceive that the Divine itself, in body, can be simultaneously in the human from the mother, which thence is infirm? Cannot anyone see that the Divine, which is life itself, made the human an image of itself, and thus also Divine? And that it did this by successive steps, as it glorified it through temptations? If this were not so, would not the corporeal idea be that the Lord’s Divine was as it were outside of the human and not within it, and as one with the human?

Would not this be thinking of a human body without the life, as of a corpse? 23. Isaiah 7:14, 15; “Immanuel”: That this is plainly said of his human, may be seen explained in Apocalypse Explained (n. 619a). 24. That the Son was born of the Father from eternity, is such a paradox that the human understanding, or even the angelic understanding in the third heaven, can by no means be so enlightened as to have any perception of it; for what is it to be born from eternity? 25. And further, it is said that the three persons are one substance or essence, when yet they are made distinct as to attributes; as it is taught that the Father created, that the Son redeemed, and that the Holy Spirit teaches. Those attributes are Divine; and when they are made distinct, it follows that the substance or essence itself, which is called one, is made distinct, by specific attributes, into three essences. 26. An arcanum in heaven and in the world, is this, namely, that things were so created that every good conjoined to truth clothes itself with forms; principally with the human form, since the Divine good and the Divine truth proceed from the Divine human of the Lord and from every part of the body. The putting on of form, which is everywhere in the atmospheres, is an arcanum of which no one yet has knowledge; and it is an essential of the atmosphere, both the spiritual and the natural.

(1) No one denies that the Divine which took upon itself the human was his Divine; thus that the Lord himself suffered himself to be born. Hence it follows that this is the Divine of which he was conceived, concerning which we read in Matthew and in Luke; and that this is the very Divine, and no other besides it, which he called his Father; nor was there any other; according to what is said in Matthew, that Joseph “touched her not”; and in Luke, when Mary said that she “knew not a man”; and when Joseph “found that she was with child,” and on that account wished to put her away. (2) The Divine of the Lord took upon itself the human; and if the Divine is one, it follows that the Divine itself, which is one, took it upon itself. Nor does the idea that the Divine which created the universe put on the human, make anything against this; for it is said in the creed that the Divine of the one person and the Divine of the other person are altogether equal, in these words: As the Father is infinite, eternal, uncreate, omnipotent, God, Lord, so likewise is the Son; for no one is first or last, greatest or least; but they are altogether equal. What then does it matter whether I think that the Divine of the Lord or the Divine of the Father took it upon itself, since in either case there exists a similar idea? For when it is said that the Divine of the Father put on the human, the idea which at the present day exists in the Christian world stands in opposition; when nevertheless this statement is altogether like the other, since the one Divine is altogether the equal of the other. (3) It is said that the Lord was perfect God and perfect man; or it is said concerning the human that he was perfect man, consisting of a rational soul and a perfect body; and afterwards, that he was man from the nature of the mother.

And are not life and the first of life from the father, and its additions from the mother? To believe that the Lord was perfect man from the mother alone, is wholly contrary to all order, and contrary to what is stated. Is not the image of the father in his children as much as that of the mother? The very love or the ruling affection of a father stands out clearly in grandchildren and in families. In a word, there must be father and mother, that a man may be a perfect man. How then is it to be believed that he was perfect man from the mother? And does it not thence follow that the Divine was in the Lord from conception, as is the soul with every man? (5) This was clearly seen by Athanasius, when he said that God and man are one Christ, and not two but a united person, like soul and body. From these things it is evident that according to the faith of our creed the Divine and the human in the Lord are together in one person, and not that the Divine is outside of the human, as many insanely hold in the idea of their thought. (6) And still further, it is said that the two natures were not commixed, but that the Divine took to itself the human. Neither are soul and body commixed, with any man; but with everyone the soul clothes itself with the body, and thus takes to itself that which is called the human. In this likewise there is agreement. (7) And when the Divine takes to itself the human, and unites itself with it as soul and body, so that there is one united person, then also the human becomes a partaker of the Divine; that is to say, by unition. From this, likewise, it may be manifest that the human also is Divine. (8) This, likewise, is confirmed in the Word; as in the Old Testament, where it said that a “Son” was born, whose name shall be called “God,” “Father of eternity”; whose name is “God-with- us”; whose name is “Jehovah our justice”; these things are said concerning the human of the Lord, for it is said that the “Son” shall so be called (Isa. 9:6).

Think, my reader, what kind of an idea you are able to have of a Son born from eternity. Is it not such an idea that it at once puts itself to flight, and consequently becomes null? So that when there is no idea there is sound only, with which no thought has anything in common? And is God to be thought of so? But if there be thought from the idea which has now been presented, then the idea becomes comprehensible; and in such alone can there be faith. 33. The learned, according to their idea, place the Divine of the Lord outside of himself, for the reason that they think of the Divine of the Father, and think only of the human of the Lord separate from the Divine, and do not think of the Divine of the Lord himself in the human. Nor do they attend to the last words in the creed of Athanasius, which they do not at all weigh; but they abide solely in the idea of the two natures, and these they separate, contrary to the words of the creed. 34. And because they separate the Divine from the human, and place the Divine outside of his human in the idea of their thought, it follows that they think that the human with the rational soul and the perfect body existed from the mother alone. That to think thus is contrary to all that is rational in man, anyone may see. 35. If, therefore, there be a trinity or a trine of the Lord, namely, the Divine from conception which is the Father, the Divine human which is the Son, and the proceeding Divine which is the Holy Spirit, then all things and every particular fall distinctly into thought, and there can also be a comprehension of God."

(2) That there is one God; and there is no need of saying with Athanasius that, although each person is God, nevertheless according to the Christian faith he is to be called one God—from which there is the appearance of his having said, that, although there are three Gods, nevertheless he was only able to say one God.

It was granted me to speak with Athanasius; and because he had confirmed himself in the faith of three Gods, he vacillated among the three; nor was he able to acknowledge one God; and from this it has come to pass that he is in error in regard to all things; nor can he know anything of the truth of faith. So, also, is it with others who have confirmed themselves in the faith of three Gods. But they who have not confirmed themselves in that faith, but who have merely heard it and retained it, and still with the faith of one God, come into heaven; for as they did not confirm themselves in it, they reject the idea of three Gods, and preserve the idea of one God. 44. They say that it is not allowable to enter with the understanding also into the things which concern the trinity, because this is from certain passages of the Word in the external sense. But while this faith reigns, and while this is required and confirmed, there is then no room for the understanding to be enlightened. Such faith closes the way of access for the light, and indeed for the understanding of the Word in the spiritual sense; when yet if one believes that the Divine is in the Lord alone, the understanding can be enlightened from many passages in the Word, which passages are not otherwise seen or understood; as, that he is one with the Father; and others besides. I heard certain spirits reasoning concer ning the three persons, and yet one God; and they reasoned from the words in the creed, that they are of one substance or one essence, and thus that the three are one; or, as is there said, that trinity is in unity and unity in trinity; thus believing that still there is one Divine; and in this manner they confirmed themselves with the lips that they are one trine and thus that it is difficult for them to believe in a unanimous trine. However, it was then said to them that they are able to say such things, and can persuade others who attend to nothing but the words that such is the case; but it was said, “Think of one,"

And it was said further that such things are in the Athanasian faith, for the reason that they were able in no other way to connect one with the other; knowing from interior thought, and from the Word also, that God is one, and consequently that there is only one person. 45. The Lord liberated and liberates from hell all who are in truths from good, and thus those who receive him thereby; thus he subjugated the hells and glorified his human. (See many passages concerning redemption in Apocalypse Explained; and others besides in the Gospels, especially the prophecies concerning him, as given in Luke 1–2, and in Matthew 1:21.) 46. In the creed of Athanasius they assume that his human consists of a rational soul and a body; and thus, as if the soul of every man were from the mother; but the soul of everyone is from the father, and its clothing from the mother; wherefore in those words Athanasius is in error. The soul of the Lord was the Divine itself, as is plainly shown in Matthew and Luke; consequently it is plain that his soul was his own Divine itself. And whereas the body is not the man, without the soul, (indeed, whatever belongs to the body, even to its least particle, lives from the soul) consequently such as the soul is, such is the body; and the body is formed to the likeness of the soul; hence to such likeness are formed the young of animals, eggs, and also grafts, as is well known. And so they make three parts in the Lord, when yet there are two, the Divine and the human; and these two are one only person. 47. As soul and body make one man, so the Divine and the human is one Christ; and this is in accordance with the creed of Athanasius. 48. First it is said that he is man from the rational soul and the body, and thus that the soul is from the mother; it is afterwards"

Let the conclusion be drawn, as clearly as possible, that the Divine could not subjugate the hells, and restore to order all things in the heavens and on the earth, except from the Divine by the assumed human; because every Divine operation passes through all order from firsts to lasts [ultima] and there operates, for in lasts are all things simultaneously; on which account it has been shown that in lasts is strength, not from themselves, but from those things which are in lasts from firsts; hence, also there is strength in the sense of the letter of the Word. It is for this reason that the Lord so often said that it is the Father in him that doeth the works; but in other places, that he himself doeth the works. Hence it may be manifest that the Divine would not have been able to do such a work, if it had not assumed the human; thus that it could no longer do it through its own Divine in the human race; for when the Lord came into the world, the human race had so removed itself, and was therefore so remote, that not even with a single one was there natural good from a spiritual origin; and thus it was consummated; which also is confirmed from various things in Daniel, and wherever in the Word we read of consummation and decision, and wherever we read of the end that should come; and from other passages also. And it may perhaps also be told that that last judgment which is described by the flood, was accomplished from the Divine that yet remained in the human race; thus that the Divine effected it from its own therein, and thus also from firsts by ultimates; the ultimate was then the Divine that yet remained in the human race. And when this ceased, in order that the human race might be saved, the Divine itself willed to make itself (the last), in the human which it assumed, and which at the same time it made Divine, so that it can forever operate from firsts by lasts."

The idea which is formed concerning a thing, is the understanding of it; if there be no understanding of it, there is merely a knowing, and they are but empty words which are thought of. The idea is manifest in the other life. Such ideas as are formed by man respecting the trinity, and concerning the union of the Divine and the human in the Lord, are many, and they are such as rather destroy than build up; I am not willing to recount them, because they are for the most part full of incongruities; when nevertheless the thought of God as being one, and that one the Lord, is the principal and fundamental in all things in the doctrine of the church; without that, no one can be saved. 59. What is said by Athanasius, that the human consists of the rational soul and the body, involves the idea that the rational soul is from the mother; when yet nothing is from the mother but the clothing, and the soul which is to be rational is from the father. Thence there is a contradiction. 60.

That the Son from eternity was the Divine human from eternity—also that it was the proceeding Divine, from which is heaven, and was thus the Divine that forms heaven—is plain from the Lord’s words, that they saw not and heard not the Father; also from considering that all things were made by the Divine truth; then that the Lord appeared as man before the sons of Israel, and that they saw under the soles of his feet, as a sapphire and as heaven as to clearness; that it is said, “This day have I begotten thee”; and that the Lord said, “Such as I was with thee from the foundation of the world”; that he also is the Son of man, spoken of in Daniel, and that the Lord became the same as to his human; also that in Luke, he is called the Son of God, for it is said that “the Word was made flesh.” Hence it is plain that it was the same and the one Divine. 63.

They think from the idea of extension and space; when yet the Divine itself is not to be thought of from the idea of extension or space; for thus, instead of God, the purest of nature and of the visible universe is thought of, from which idea a man becomes a natural man, and at last an atheist, acknowledging nature as creator. And nevertheless the idea of extension and space does not exist in the spiritual world, where spaces are only appearances of space (concerning which, see Heaven and Hell). But of God there should be no other idea than that of the Divine man; and of the creation of the entire heaven and the entire world, no other than as from the sun which is the Divine love; and of the proceeding Divine, from which was the entire heaven, and the entire world, the idea of extension can be held, especially in the natural world. 69.

They who receive it, see and acknowledge, these have been conjoined with the angels. The reason of this is, that all heaven is in that acknowledgment; wherefore the operation of heaven is received only by those who are in the life of faith, which is charity. 97. It may possibly, indeed, be received by others; but by those only who care not whether they think and do wickedly or falsely; as for example, by dissemblers, who can be in any affection; but this, in the state in which they are while listening; and afterwards they likewise take their allotted places in hell, according to their lives. 98. The Lord lived in so humble a way as scarcely to be distinguished from an ordinary man, and not in splendor as God, that the Jews might not acknowledge him as the Messiah from externals, but from internals; and for the same reason he was not willing to give them signs from heaven; for if they had acknowledged him in any other way, and afterwards had not seen themselves exalted to be the lords of earth, they would have fallen back, and so would have become profaners; it was for this reason that he was not willing to give them a sign (concerning which see . . .). That he was the possessor of all things, may be manifest from this: that he fed the five thousand, then the four thousand, also that he gave them wine to drink at Cana, and that he was able to pay the tribute money from the mouth of a fish. But that he willed to seem poor, was for the reason already given. 99. That he was a carpenter’s son, was because “a worker in wood” signifies the good of life from the doctrine of truth."

It is said that he also is a rational man; but because such a rational man is from the mother alone, lest there should be contradiction it therefore follows that the Divine and the human are one person; so there is agreement, and a contradiction does not result. 102. It was from the papists that the Lord’s human was made to be less than the Divine of the Father, and thus less than his own Divine. 103. That the Lord’s human is Divine, is manifest from the passages in the Word where the Lord is called “redeemer”; as in the Old Testament, “Jehovah your redeemer,” “the Lord your redeemer”; and this then is the Divine human, for the Lord was the redeemer as to that. 104. Whereas the Lord alone is acknowledged in all the heavens, and the trine one in him, therefore to acknowledge the Lord is the first thing. In no other way can any idea of the thought enter heaven, but is repelled; and neither is conjunction given in heaven, and thus in the world, and consequently there is not elevation into heaven after death. 105. The Lord in many passages calls himself the Divine truth or “the Word,” as in John in his transfiguration in the presence of the disciples, and in other places; the same is signified by “the Son of man,” and also by “the sons of man” in the Old Testament. 106. By his death the Lord rejected all the human that was from the mother, and put on the human from the Father (concerning which see Apocalypse Explained, n. 899c at the end)."

To spirits who were saying that they believed in three persons and still one God, because there is one essence or substance to the three, I said “What need is there of the metaphysical term essence, and substance?” that I might by this means persuade them. “Consult your thoughts; do you not think of three Gods? And so do you not believe in three Gods? Can you by any means think metaphysically?” And it was found that it was so; for if there are three persons there are three Gods. That term involves nothing else than that they are of one mind; or that what one wills another wills; and what one does another wills; and then their properties differ; and then the Father is implored for the sake of the Son, and the Holy Spirit is approached for the sake of enlightenment; the Father is adored on account of creation, the Son on account of redemption, and the Holy Spirit for the sake of enlightenment. Would not this be allowable if God were three persons? And each is one and another, as to works. 109. Worshiping the Father only, induces a severe pain in the arm and the shoulder blade. I know this by experience, for it has been tried many times. 110.

Scarcely anyone knows why the Lord came into the world and became man; therefore it shall be told; but it falls within the understanding of the learned only. There are successive things from the Lord through the heavens to man, and thus to ultimates. Successive order is not continuous but discrete; that is, one thing is from another, as is the case with everything in the world. The more remote things in successive order contain in themselves the successive things in their own order; which order is called simultaneous. In this order, namely, the simultaneous, all the successive things are together; so formed that you may wish to have a conception of them: the first things are there created within; and so on, even to the last circumference; and because successive things are together in the simultaneous, therefore in things simultaneous is all strength or all power at once. And because there was no longer this ultimate with men in the world, that is, in their truths and goods in which the Lord has his abode, therefore he himself came into the world, that he might become the last, and that so the first might act by last things and reduce to order all things in the heavens and in the hells; that is, from firsts by lasts; for when he acted from firsts by lasts, he acted also by all things, and thus likewise by the successive things which were in order in the lasts as in their firsts. This now was the cause of the coming of the Lord into the world; thus also he was where there is fullness in his creation; and the Lord works those things which he works, where there is fullness. It is for this reason that the Lord is called in the Word “the first and the last”; and for the same reason the Word in the letter is most holy, because this is the Divine truth in the ultimate of order, and for the same reason also strength itself is there. That this is so, is known to me more than to others. For the same reason the Lord said to the disciples that he has flesh and bones, otherwise than a spirit; and thus can the Lord be present with man in ultimates, and can save those who also are in ultimates."

Moreover, it cannot be comprehended in the world that the Lord from himself could arrange into order all things in the heavens and the hells. But they do not understand this, because they think from space and distance.

He is there said to be “Father of eternity,” “Jehovah,” “one with the Father,” “in the Father and the Father in him.” The Father can be in no other human than that which is from himself, and thus his own Divine human. 119. From first creation he was in a human, and in a human from himself; namely, in the universal heaven, which in the complex constitutes one man; but this was not his own proper [human], because it was in the angels of heaven; but in the Divine human he is in his own, that is proper to himself. 120. That men do not comprehend that the creator of the universe can be in a human, is for the reason that their conception of the universe is from space, which idea does not reach God unless there be the idea of the proceeding Divine; nor should the idea of the proceeding Divine in the spiritual world be taken from space, but in the natural world only. Of the Divine from which is the universe, an idea is to be conceived in no other way than as of the Divine man in firsts, who is life itself, and whose Divine love appears as a sun above the heavens, whence all things are. 121. The Lord means his own Divine by “Father”; this, therefore, assumed the human; wherefore it is as his soul in the body; for “the Father” cannot be understood to have been a first person, since so there would have been two Fathers. The Divine cannot be in any other body than its own; thus it must be Divine. 122. That heaven was endangered by conjunction with the hells in its disordered ultimates, may be illustrated by the extreme prostration of a man, from which at last he dies; and that thus no one could have been saved if the Lord had not come into the world, is illustrated in Apocalypse Explained (n. 744); in which work it is also shown that the more distinct the separation of heaven and hell, the more perfect is the state of heaven (n. 746a)."

So it was with the Lord, in the particulars of his passion. 166. It was permitted to say three persons, for the reason that at the beginning there could be no thought unless of Jehovah God, the Father, the creator of the universe, and it could scarcely be thought that the Lord was he; wherefore it was useful. This seemed to them to be a thing that could not be received, that the creator of the universe so descended and became man; simply the idea of Jehovah as filling all heaven and all the world from his presence and his providence, would stand somewhat in the way of that. Wherefore in the sense of the letter of the Word three are named for that reason; as if they were three persons into whose names they were to baptize. Hence also it was permitted that similar things should be said in the Athanasian Faith, which was to be received for Christianity; but still, so that it should be possible for the trine of one person, thus of the Lord, to be received by those who are in enlightenment; and likewise so that in the end of the church it might be received. The Athanasian Faith is such as to be incomprehensible, and thence incredible, and likewise contradictory. (Let things that are therein be adduced.) This truth is laid open, and that Faith does not preclude anyone from receiving it; but this may be done by those who wish to understand what they believe; let those, however, who do not wish to understand what they believe, remain in their own opinion; but let them know that in the spiritual world no one receives anything which he does not see, that is, understand; for he says, “Perhaps it is not true.” 167. (1) Mohammedans have not acknowledged three persons, but one God; they have therefore denied the Divinity of the Lord, and have acknowledged the Father alone as God. (2) The Socinians, also, do the same, and for the same reason; they say that there is one God, and that he is the Father.

Let each one examine himself to see whether he has the idea of Divinity in respect to the Lord; and yet there must be belief in him, that men may have eternal life. (4) On the same grounds the Jews revile the Christians, as having three Gods. (5) For the same reason, the greater part in the other life, when they are explored, are found to worship the Father only, or the Holy Spirit, and not the Lord; and, yet, without faith in the Lord there is no safety. (6) All these things, because among us they have distinguished divinity into three persons. 168. To say three persons and one God is contradictory, for the term “person” involves something distinct and different from another. The distinction and the difference, also, is itself laid down in the doctrine of the church; and because the distinction differs among the persons, it follows that each is a separate God from another; and if separate, it follows that there are three Gods. That the substance or essence makes one God therefrom, this falls within the idea of no one, when the essence or substance is itself distinguished by the attributes of the one not proper to the other; for so one is worshiped for this attribute and another for that. 169. But if you think that the substance or essence is what is called person, then there necessarily results one person and the trine in that; and thus unity in trinity and trinity in unity. 170. And still further, each attribute by which one person is distinguished from another, is Divine. The attribute of the Father is Divine, the attribute of the Son is Divine, the attribute of the Holy Spirit is Divine; and whatever Divine there is in the three persons9 is a distinct Divine substance or essence; and because Athanasius saw this, he took care that the three should all be in each single attribute. From these considerations it follows that the substance and essence also is not one unless it be in one person."

That the human of the Lord is Divine is manifest from this also: that it is said in John that it was the Word by which all things were made and created, and that the eternal Word is called God (John 1:1, 2); and that it is also said that this was made flesh; consequently, that God, who is the Word, was made flesh, that is, man. Hence it follows that the Lord’s human is Divine. 172. That in the world the Lord accomplished a last judgment, is manifest from all the passages in the prophets where his coming is spoken of; which is called “the terrible day,” “cruel,” etc., etc., etc. 173. The Coming of the Lord is revealed, in the end of the church. At the end of the Jewish church, the Lord himself came into the flesh, and he then revealed himself as being God or Jehovah who was to come, as told in the Prophets, and still further, that he it is who rules heaven with the earth, and who is the one only God. This, in the Gospels (Matt. 24), is also called his Coming. Hitherto, however, he has been almost neglected,10 because in thought and in idea he has been like a common man; in regard to whom there has been almost no thought of anything Divine, for the reason that men have in their idea placed the Divine outside of him and not within him, as nevertheless he teaches that it is; and by the Divine outside of him, most have understood the Father, and thus another person; so that the Lord has been almost neglected in the world, at the end. Consequently his new and second Coming is made. 174. That the Lord is the creator is manifest in John: “By the Word were all things made that were made”; and also that he is the proceeding Divine because he is “the Light.” 175. That the Lord is so often called the Father, was because the Lord before his Advent was himself the one who is called the Father; and then the Son was the proceeding Divine, or the Word; this was then the Son, and this was then the Divine human; and they who are mentioned in the Old Testament, before the Lord was born, and before he was called the Son of God as to the Divine human, knew no other Father, for there was no other.

The proceeding good is called by the Lord “the Father in the heavens”; to see this is to be in love and in innocence. But the proceeding Divine truth, the Lord calls “the Son of man.” 177. The proceeding Divine before the coming of the Lord, is described as to its quality by circles and by degrees, through the heavens and through the interiors of man. The degrees are successive (concerning which, see Heaven and Hell); wherefore while it is in every11 degree, they correspond with each other, and they thus as it were transfer to each other; but when in the ultimate degree there is no longer a reception of the Divine, as was the case in the church with the Jews, then the proceeding Divine could not be extended thither. Wherefore the Lord himself took on the human, from which the proceeding Divine would go forth; and this can also be in ultimates, and so can preserve the heavens and save the human race. Thence is the omnipresence of his human in the holy supper. He spoke of his omnipresence in Matthew. 178. The proceeding Divine, however, is such that in things greatest and in things least it is man. For such as it is in what is greatest, such it is in every least thing, and this in nature where the proceeding Divine is in ultimates. For all things were so created that affection which is of good, or love which is of good, or good which is of affection and love, clothes itself with what is human in the several degrees from first to last. Hence angels are human forms; and so it is in nature; whence the human form is there. This arcanum has been hitherto unknown in the world. That there is such a disposition in the several degrees, that is, that affection clothes itself with a body, and this from the proceeding Divine, is for the reason that what proceeds from the Lord proceeds from the single things of his body, interior and exterior. It is in consequence of this that the proceeding Divine is the Lord in the heavens, and is called “the Son of man,” and likewise “the Paraclete,” and “the Holy Spirit.” From this it is evident what his omnipresence is."

Hence, also, love is the complex of all truths, and love is the being [esse] whose existence [existere] is the human in form, in every particular of which must be the being from love. 179. (The cause of the Lord’s coming: because strength is in ultimates, and so in the material body. Let the causes be investigated, whence it is that strength is in ultimates; see Psalm 68:28–30; otherwise it has no power over the natural man, where all evil is; “the wild beast12 of the reed” (verse 30) is the natural man. From this the Lord is called “strength,” also “right hand,” by which is signified all power.) 180. The Lord is the only God, Isa. 45:13, 14; there concerning the Lord. 181. The whole life of the Lord was representative, so that he might be in ultimates, and so from things first by things ultimate might subjugate the hells and reduce all things into order; in ultimates is all strength. It is for this reason that by all things of his passion, also, was represented the state of the church; how it is against the Divine, and against the truths and goods of heaven and the church. It is an arcanum that spirits do not see the man, but only his affections; and the evil are wholly opposed to the affections of truth and good, and have them in hatred, and attempt to destroy them utterly. So did the Lord admit temptations into himself, for the reason that he was at the same time in ultimates. And so it is to be understood that he fulfilled all things of the Law. 182. Concerning the temptations of the Lord, with which may be compared the temptations with man—namely, that the temptations with man cause the hells to be removed, and man to become spiritual and an angel; what then was done by the temptations of the Lord, who from conception was God, and who"

Purity coming from an imputation of the merit of the Lord can be understood by no one, if the man be not purified as to the life. Can the imputation of the Lord’s merit reform, alter and change a man, and from a devil make him an angel? Must not the evil of life be removed? Can this be done by the imputation of merit, and by condoning sins, and by justification through faith alone, so that God gives no attention to the evils? The evils remain, and they infect and infest societies. 185. According to the common idea, the Divine is distinguished into three persons; but according to the idea drawn from the creed of Athanasius, the second person is not only Divine, but is human also; so that in the second person there is more than there is in the first or the third, namely, the human; and this can in no wise be saved unless there be a trine in the Lord, and unless his human be Divine. 186. When it is said that God became man; also that God was willing to be born of the virgin Mary; then that the Word, which was God, was made flesh; also as stated in the creed of Athanasius, that the Divine took to itself the human; does it not then clearly follow that the human is Divine? (Let this be taken up again and shown.) 187.

Hence it follows that the human is the Divine human; otherwise the human could not be assumed by the Divine, when they are as soul and body. And consequently there is not commixture, but union; like that of soul and body. 189. There is the idea of the Divine human concerning God in all the earths in the universe (references); it also exists with the Gentiles of our earth, as with the Africans; and this from the influx of heaven. But this idea has been destroyed with Christians, especially the intelligent, for the reason that they think from space, and thus from extension; when nevertheless, he as man is girded about with the Divine love; this appears about the Lord as man, like a sun. 190. This love, or sun, is his Divine love that proximately proceeds from him; the radiant circles are devolutions of the infinite, so that it may be applied to the angels in their order; for an angel can bear the presence of the Divine love no more than a man can bear the presence of the fire of the sun. 191. The proceeding Divine is what is extended into the universe; and it is the Divine truth, and the light of that sun. Hence it is the inmost of the spiritual world; and it is this from which nature had its origin; this is also extended in the created universe; it is afterwards formed successively into spheres, the last of which is the atmosphere of the natural world. 192. (Let it also be described how he could expel the maternal human—namely, that the maternal human was infirm which adheres to nature; and because that is evil, it was in correspondence with hell. When this is expelled, then succeed those things which are concordant with the Divine and in correspondence with it. For the body is only a correspondence of the soul or spirit of man; and there is correspondence with heaven so far as this is removed; so also, what is new is set in its place, and thus man is regenerated and is made spiritual and an angel."

But evil, with man, cannot be expelled, but is removed. Because he is not in life in himself, and because he is not the Divine as to soul, but is only a recipient of the Divine, therefore man dies, as to the body. But the Lord from the Divine in himself expelled the evil which was from the mother; wherefore he rose with the whole body. He retained the infirm while he was in the world because in no other way could he be tempted, and least of all on the cross; there the whole maternal was expelled.) 193. Following the Athanasian doctrinal concerning the trinity, the thought must necessarily be that three Gods together make one Divine; for of three that are consentient there can be the thought of one thing, but not of God as a person. Since this is so, and this was foreseen by Athanasius, it was said that although there are three, still according to the Catholic faith it must not be said otherwise than one God. But the thought and the speech must be alike and the same; nor can they be otherwise. 194. That the Lord made his human Divine, is also evident from this, that he subjugated all the hells. For the evils with man are from no other source than hell, or from influx therefrom through evil spirits; and when these are removed, man is as it were without evils. But the Lord from his Divine so removes the hells that they do not gape open to look at him, nor are they able to name him; thus he removed them by separating the hells and their crews13 from himself; and he continually separates them; and when these are removed, evils also are removed, for to remove the hells and to remove the evils is the same thing. But the Lord, because from the Divine, and being the Divine as to the life and soul, completely separated them from himself. And from this also it is evident that he made his human Divine. 195. When it is said that God the Father assumed the human, it is perceived by the man of the church as a thing too exalted to be thought of, and greater than could possibly be done.

That the Lord’s Divine is what he calls the Father, is evident from the Word, and also from the Faith of the church; but that he calls this the Father has not been thought hitherto. 197. (Let passages concerning the Father be adduced, and let the Gospel of John be read, from beginning to end.) 198. The idea of Europeans, especially of the learned, is also a fallacy; it comes from this, that it cannot possibly be thought that man, or what is human, can be Divine; when, nevertheless, they who are in the third heaven, cannot at all have any other idea, and this from the influx of heaven (of which elsewhere). 199. Also the wise men of old, as is evident from the Word throughout, when angels were seen, called them Jehovah, and creator of the universe. (Let passages be adduced, also, from Revelation.) 200. (Also let the many passages concerning the Lord be quoted, which are found in Revelation, where many Divine things are said concerning the Lord or the Lamb.) 201.

The case is different with men, because their life or soul, from the father, is affection which is evil; consequently evil is removed from them by the Lord; it is not separated. 203. Still further, all the infants in heaven are led to the acknowledgment of the Divine human of the Lord; and all adults who have lived in the life of charity are instructed concerning this; and they who receive, come into heaven. All the angels in heaven, also, perceive that the Lord’s human is Divine; and the higher they are in the heavens, the more clearly do they perceive this; for no one there can think otherwise. The reason is, that the whole heaven is the Divine human, and every thought also goes according to the form of heaven. (On this subject let those things be cited which are in Heaven and Hell.) 204. Whereas this is so, and this is the primary thing of the church, also because no one can be received and saved unless he acknowledges the Divine of the Lord in his human, therefore he so often said, “Believe ye that I am able to do this?” “Be it done according to thy faith”; that is, that the Lord is omnipotent, and thus God. 205.

(Let the Lord’s words to Peter be brought forward, where he thrice said “Lovest thou me, Simon Peter?” And yet he did not follow the Lord, but John followed him. These things were said, because by “Peter” are here signified those who are in faith alone and by “John” the good of charity. From the words to Peter it is plain that they who are in the doctrine of faith alone will not acknowledge the Divine human of the Lord, but they only who are in the good of charity. For this reason, also, something is to be said here as to what is meant by “loving the Lord.” That faith without charity cannot be given, and that faith is from charity, also that the faith is such as the charity is, may be seen in New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine; and it will be seen in Apocalypse Explained, in many places.) 209. Christians can scarcely think of and perceive the Divine human (this may be shown from the experience of many); because they think of a common man, and not concerning the human essence, which is love.

It is for this reason that this now is taught; this is the occasion of the present work; for without that faith no one comes into the new church, neither does anyone receive anything from its doctrine; consequently, without this faith no one henceforth can be saved.

It is known from two passages in Matthew and in Luke which have been quoted, that the Lord is the Son of God, or that his Father was the very Divine which created the universe. If therefore as man he is the Son of God, it follows also that the Lord as man is God. It is known that everyone is named from his father, and is called his son, from this and on account of this, namely, that the life of every man is from his father, and only the clothing is supplied in the mother; thence it is that every man is named from the father and not from the mother. Why therefore, when it is known that his Father was his Divine, is it said in the church that the Lord is “the son of Mary,” from which comes the belief that the Lord was thus born a mere15 man, or not God as to the human? 216. And further, what a man has from his father is the very love, or the very affection, because the love is man’s very life, and the body lives from that; and thus it is plain that man’s very life is from the father, and nothing of life from the mother. Since therefore the very life was Divine, or was the Divine love, and the body is simply obedience, it thence clearly follows that the Lord as man is God. (Here quote, first and last, what is written in Luke 1:34, 35.) 217. The Lord is treated of in the whole prophetic Word. To quote the many passages where he is called “the holy one of Israel,” “the redeemer,” and “Jehovah the redeemer,” would be too diffuse. See Isaiah 60:1, etc., where it is said, “Jehovah shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee”; besides many other things there which were said concerning the Divine human."

The Lord became invisible; nevertheless he was in the human body; this could not have been from the mother (from the Word). 7. What is this: that the Divine is distinguished into three persons? Where is this in the Word?"

But that the Divine is one, or one person, or one man, this is understood; then that the Divine was from eternity. 9. But they are to be excused who have not known anything concerning the style of the Word—that there is a spiritual sense in every expression. 10. Concerning the mother he also said: That she was not blessed because she bare him; but that they are blessed that hear the Word and keep it (Luke 11:27, 28). He said this lest they should attribute to her something Divine because she was the mother. 11. He went out from the Father, and came into the world, and returns to the Father (John 14:27–28). 12. He went out from the Father (John 14:12; 16:5, 10, 16–17, 30; 17:8; also John 10:9; Isaiah 25:9). 13. He came down from heaven (from the Word). WHAT IS BELIEVED 14. It is believed in the Christian world that angels have assumed human bodies, and have thus appeared to men; but they did not assume them, but the eyes of man’s spirit were opened, and so they were seen. So did angels appear to Abraham and to the others; so did the horses and chariots of fire appear around Elisha, where it is said, “Open his eyes” (2 Kings 6:17). That the Lord appeared thus, is known; but with the difference that the Lord appeared as to the body which he had in the world; angels, however, as to the bodies which belong to spirits, which are in human form, but not as the Lord was."

It is known that men are made spiritual through temptations. Much more was this the case with the Lord, because he was God from conception. 17. Through temptations man becomes spiritual and is conjoined to heaven. But the Lord through temptations conjoined his human to the Divine itself which was in him, and so he became God as to the human. 18. Anyone can see that the soul which was the very Divine could not dwell in an infirm body such as it is from its own nature. The case is different with the bodies of men who from the father are born into evil affections. 19. All are allotted places in the heavens according to the idea of their faith in respect to the Divine human of the Lord, and therefore2 according to their reception of the Lord through truths and goods. (Let the Gentiles be considered, concerning whom . . .) FROM REASON 20. Through this the Papists have claimed for themselves Divine authority. 21. The affection itself which is of the love, is from the father; and this is also a man’s very life or soul; but the clothing is from the mother. Hence it is manifest of what quality the Lord was, as to the soul, or life—that he was the Divine love. And this could not be together with what was put on from the mother, without casting it off successively, for the mother was born into sins, as is every man. This was the infirm human which he assumed, so as to be able to admit into himself temptations, and to conquer the hells, and to dispose into order all things in the heavens and the hells; when this"

It may be known that such as a man is as to affection which is of love, such is the man. Who does not value another according to his affection? 22. That the Lord executed a judgment when he was in the world, is plainly evident from many passages in the Word, as from all those in which is named “the day of Jehovah,” which is said to be terrible, and which is called “the day of Zebaoth.” FROM ATHANASIUS 23. It is there said that the Divine took to itself the human. But it is according to the Lord’s words that the Divine took to itself the human, and that the human took to itself the Divine; for he says, “Believe me that the Father is in me and I am in the Father.” That he said this concerning his human, is evident from the words that immediately precede, “He that seeth me, seeth the Father,” etc. 24. I can assert, and declare it as certain, that such as is man’s idea of faith concerning the Lord, such is the conjunction that he has in heaven. FROM EXPERIENCE 25. Because it has been granted me to have consociation with angels, to speak with them, and to see the things that are in the heavens, and also to speak with those who have died—with nearly all whom I have known—I wish to tell something concerning it that I have heard on this subject: 26. Christians for the most part acknowledge three Gods, and they seek for one or another; only they who are in the affection of spiritual truth acknowledge the Lord alone as God."

God himself came into the world and put on the human, and made this Divine (John 1:1, 3, 14), namely: God was the Word, and the Word was made Flesh (John 1:1, 14); thus God was made Flesh, that is, man.

He was also seen by the disciples; he was man before their eyes, and he was also man when he became invisible (Luke 24:31). Whence this was. 46. He is omnipresent “all the days”3 (Matt. 28:20); and in the Holy Supper he is omnipresent as to the human; and omnipresence is Divine. 47. He has all authority in the heavens and in earth, as to the human also. 48. He is to judge all; to him has been given judgment, also, in the last day. 49. He was united to his Divine by successive steps, for reasons that will be given below; and he was united [to it] through temptations and victories. Full unition was accomplished by the passion of the cross. (From passages in the Word.) 50. So far as he was united, so far he spoke with himself; but so far as he was not yet united, so far he spoke as with another.

What is meant by this—That the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Lord—but that which is holy proceeds, which is called the Holy Spirit? 65. The sin against the Holy Spirit is the denial of the Divine of the Lord (Matt. 12:28, 32; Mark 3:28, 29; Luke 11:20, etc.). This is evident from what precedes. They said that he cast out demons “by the prince of the demons”; and he said that he did it “by the Spirit of God,” that is, by his own Divine. This denial in heart is not remitted, for such cannot enter heaven; as all Socinians. (Some things concerning them from experience.) 66. Also they within the church who deny the Divine of the Lord, and who acknowledge the Father only, cannot be saved. And very many of them acknowledge nature; and they therefore have no other idea of the Divine than as of nature in its least parts. Reasons will be given why they cannot be turned to the Lord, but turn to worldly loves. (These things last.)"

That by “the Spirit of God” is meant the Divine, is also manifest in Luke, where it is said, “By the finger of God” (Luke 11:20); and “the finger of God” signifies the Divine power. 68. That the Father means by the Divine of the Lord is evident; also that the Lord says that their sons cast out demons through him (Matt. 12:27; also Luke 11:19). Jesus gave unto the disciples authority over all demons (Luke 9:1; 10:17, 20; Mark 16:17, 18). That in the name of the Lord they cast out demons (Luke 9:49, 50; Mark 9:38). 69. That among Christians the human was made distinct from the Divine, and was made merely human, was chiefly for the sake of the pope, who did not dare to call himself God’s vicar. 70. Every man is born ignorant of truth, and desirous of evil, because his soul, from his father, is an evil affection. But the Lord alone is born seeking good, and desiring truth, because his soul from the Father was the Divine itself, thus the affection of Divine love, or the Divine love, from which he subdued the external which was from the mother. 71.
