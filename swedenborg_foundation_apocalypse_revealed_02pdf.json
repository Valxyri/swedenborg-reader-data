      "text": "APOCALYPSE REVEALED 677 Editor’s Preface Apocalypse Revealed is a detailed unfolding of the inner or spiritual sense of the book of Revelation. This is the first of Swedenborg’s later works to which he appended so-called “memorable relations,” which are descriptions of otherworld events he witnessed. In 1765 he had stopped writing in his Spiritual Diary—a work which contains much similar material—and now in this 1766 work (and all of his subsequent publications) he included accounts of such happenings. In a letter written to his friend Dr. Gabriel Beyer in April 1766 he recommended that the doctor read these passages first. This is the last work that Swedenborg published anonymously. Unlike his earlier work, Apocalypse Explained, published posthumously, this one is openly addressed to the Christian world, and thus marks an apparently new attitude on Swedenborg’s part as to where the new church was to have its origin. This present edition was translated from the Latin by John Whitehead. The text was electronically scanned from the Swedenborg Foundation’s Standard Edition. This has allowed the book to be completely redesigned and set in a new and more readable typeface. Certain stylistic changes have also been introduced. These include modernized spelling and punctuation as well as the substitution of new words for terms whose meanings have become obscure or have changed since the nineteenth century. Arabic numerals have replaced roman numerals in Bible passages, and certain capitalized words, including pronouns referring to God, have been lowercased to reflect contemporary usage. All these changes have been carefully made in order to make the book easier to read and use while preserving the dignity and power of the original Latin. On the whole, however, the Whitehead translation has not been materially altered. A word needs to be said about the translation of the Scripture passages in this work, some of which Swedenborg translated from biblical Hebrew and Greek, others he cited from Latin Bibles in his"

The reader will note that the archaic language of the 1611 King James Bible, commonly called the Authorized Version, has for the most part been retained in the Scripture citations in this edition. Thus verbs will often have the suffix “- eth,” and pronoun forms such as “thee,” “thou,” and “thine” are retained. This custom, based on the almost universal use of the King James version at that time, dates back to the earliest English translations of Swedenborg. The decision was made by the early translators to follow the familiar language of that Bible wherever it did not conflict with the Latin of Swedenborg’s Scripture citations. Although it would be desirable to update this language, these citations appear so frequently that changing them throughout the entire work would have required a major revision. Volume 2 of Apocalypse Revealed continues Swedenborg’s verse- by-verse explanation, or commentary, of the biblical text of the Apocalypse, commonly known as the book of Revelation or the Revelation of John. This volume covers chapters 14 through 22. As was the custom in his day, Swedenborg referred to the Psalms as the book of David, and to the Pentateuch (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy) as the books of Moses. Numbers indicating the paragraph subdivisions used in John Faulkner Potts’ six-volume Swedenborg Concordance (London: Swedenborg Society, 1888–1902) are inserted in this American edition for the first time. They appear in bracketed boldface type at the beginning of paragraphs. The numbers in parentheses (6), (7), etc., are divisions of the exposition by the author. Italicized letters following a number (518a, 518b) are subdivisions added by the Latin editor, Samuel H. Worcester. Words or phrases in brackets are also editorial insertions into Swedenborg’s text. Critical notes, referenced by superscripts in the text, will be found at the end of the volume. William Ross Woofenden Sharon, Massachusetts"

These are they who were not defiled with women, for they are virgins; these are they who follow the lamb whithersoever he goeth; these were bought from among men, the firstfruits to God and the lamb. 5.

The proclamation of the Lord’s coming, and then the new church (verses 6, 7, 13). An exhortation to recede from faith separated from charity, in which is the church at the present day (verses 9–12). The exploration of these, and the manifestation that their works are evil (verses 14–20)."

Verse 13. “And I heard a voice from heaven, saying to me, Write,3 Blessed are the dead that die in the Lord from henceforth” signifies a prediction from the Lord concerning the state of those after death who will be of his new church, that they will have eternal life and happiness (n. 639). “Yea, saith the spirit, that they may rest from their labors” signifies that the Divine truth of the Word teaches that they who afflict their soul and crucify their flesh for the sake of those things, will have peace in the Lord (n. 640). “For their works follow with them” signifies according as they have loved and believed, and thence have done and spoken (n. 641).

Verse 16. “And he that sat upon the cloud sent his sickle, and the earth was reaped” signifies the end of the church, because there is no longer any Divine truth there (n. 646).

Verse 20. “And the winepress was trodden without the city” signifies that exploration was made from the Divine truths of the Word as to the quality of the works which flow forth from the doctrine of faith of the church (n. 652). “And there went out blood from the winepress even unto the bridles of the horses” signifies violence done to the Word by dreadful falsifications of the truth, and the understanding so closed up thereby, that man can scarcely be taught any longer, and thus be led of the Lord by Divine truths (n. 653). “For a thousand six hundred stadia” signifies mere falsities of evil (n. 654).

By “I saw” are signified the things which follow in this chapter; by “a lamb” is meant the Lord as to the Divine human (n. 269, 271); by “Mount Zion” is signified heaven, where they are who are in love to the Lord, as will be seen presently; by “a hundred forty-four thousand” are signified all who acknowledge the Lord alone to be the God of heaven and"

These were treated of in chapter 7; but there, that “they were sealed on their foreheads,” and thus were distinguished and separated from the rest; now however that they were collected together into one, and that a heaven was from them. [2] The heaven here treated of is the heaven collected from Christians, from the time the Lord was in the world, and from such of them as approached the Lord alone, and lived according to his precepts in the Word, by shunning evils as sins against God. This heaven is the new heaven, from which the holy Jerusalem, that is, the new church upon earth, will descend (Rev. 21:1–2). But the heavens which were formed before the Lord’s coming are above this heaven, and are called the ancient heavens; in which likewise all acknowledge the Lord alone to be the God of heaven and earth. These heavens communicate with this new heaven by influx. [3] It is known, that by “the land of Canaan” is signified the church, because the Word was there, and by it the Lord was known; also because in the midst of it was the city Zion, and under it the city Jerusalem, both upon a mountain. Hence by “Zion” and “Jerusalem” are signified the inmost things of the church; and as the church in the heavens makes one with the church on earth, therefore by “Zion” and “Jerusalem” is meant the church everywhere, but by “Zion” the church as to love, and by “Jerusalem” the church as to doctrine from love. It is called “Mount Zion” because by “a mountain” is signified love (n. 336). [4] That by “Mount Zion” is signified heaven and the church where the Lord alone is worshiped, may appear from the following passages: I have anointed my king upon Zion; I will announce concerning the statute, Thou art my son, this day have I begotten thee; I will give the nations for thy inheritance; kiss the son, lest he be angry, and ye perish; happy are all that trust in him (Ps. 2:6–8, 12)."

The reason why it is here said, “the name of his Father on their foreheads,” is also because by “Father” is meant the Divine good of the Lord’s Divine love, which in the Word of the Evangelists is everywhere meant by “the Father,” when named by the Lord, and the Divine truth of the Divine wisdom by “the son”; which two were united as soul to body and body to soul, when the Lord glorified his human (see n. 21, 170); and since they are one, it is therefore said in another place: The name of God and of the lamb on their forehead (Rev. 22:4).

That the angels here treated of are angels of the higher heavens, may be seen in the explanation of chapter 7, particularly at n. 362. By “written on their foreheads” is signified acknowledgment from love and faith in them; by “written” or “inscribed” is signified acknowledgment in them, and by “the forehead” is signified love and thence intelligence or faith (n. 347, 605). [2] That the Divine, which is called the Father, and the Divine human, which is called the son, are one, like soul and body, and consequently that the Lord is to be approached as to the Divine human, and that thus and not otherwise the Divine, which is called the Father, is approached, appears from so many passages in the Word that they would fill many pages if they were to be adduced; a large collection of them may be found in Doctrine of the Lord (n. 29–36, 38–45, and following); from which a few only shall here be quoted by way of confirmation, which are these: The angel said to Mary, Behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name Jesus. He shall be great, and shall be called the son of the Highest. But Mary said, How shall this be, since I know not a man. The angel answered, The Holy Spirit shall come upon thee, and the power of the Most High shall overshadow thee, therefore also, that holy one which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of God (Luke 1:30–35). The ang el of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, Fear not to take Mary thy bride, for that which is born in her is from the Holy Spirit; and Joseph knew her not, until she brought forth her firstborn son (Matt. 1:20, 25). In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and God was the Word, and the Word was made flesh, and we saw his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father (John 1:1–2, 14).The Jews sought to kill Jesus, because he had said that God was his own Father, making himself equal to God. Jesus answered, Whatsoever the Father doeth, these also doeth the son likewise; as the Father raiseth up the dead and vivifieth them, even so the son vivifieth whom he will; Verily I say unto you, that the hour shall come, when the dead shall hear the voice of the son ofGod, and they that hear shall live (John 5:18–26)."

That “lightnings, thunders, and voices” signify enlightenment, perception, and instruction, may be seen above (n. 236); and that “the seven thunders speaking” signify the Lord speaking through the entire heaven (n. 472). The Lord, when he speaks through heaven, speaks from the third heaven through the second heaven, thus from Divine love through Divine wisdom, for the third heaven is in his Divine love, and the second heaven in his Divine wisdom. The Lord never speaks otherwise when he speaks from the higher heavens; and this is what is meant by “a voice as of many waters,” and by “a voice of great thunder”; “many waters” are the Divine truths of the Divine wisdom, and “great thunder” is the Divine good of the Divine love. 616. And I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps signifies confession of the Lord from joy of heart by the spiritual angels in the lower heavens. To harp upon the harp signifies to confess the Lord from spiritual truths, see above (n. 276); that this is from joy of heart follows; hence by “harpers” are signified spiritual angels. The reason why they are angels of the lower heavens is because the voice of the Lord through the higher heavens was heard as “the voice of many waters,” and as “the voice of great thunder” (n. 614, 615). There was heard “a voice of harpers harping upon harps,” because sound or speech descending from the lower heavens is sometimes heard like the sound of harps; not that they are harping upon harps, but because the voice of confession of the Lord from joy of heart is so heard below. 617.

This is implied in the expression “as it were,” for “as it were a new song” signifies as though it were new, when nevertheless it is not new. That the new heaven mentioned in Revelation (chap. 21:1) is a new heaven from Christians, and that the former heavens are from the ancient and most ancient people, also that the Lord is acknowledged in these heavens as the God of heaven and earth, has been said before. 618. And no one was able to learn the song but the hundred forty- four thousand signifies that no others from Christians could understand, and thus from love and faith acknowledge, that the Lord alone is the God of heaven and earth, but those who were received by the Lord into this new heaven. By this “song” is signified the acknowledgment and glorification of the Lord, that he is the God of heaven and earth (n. 279, 617); by “learning” is signified to perceive interiorly in oneself that it is so, which is to understand, and so to receive and acknowledge; he who learns otherwise, learns and does not learn, because he does not retain. By the hundred forty-four thousand are meant they who acknowledge the Lord alone as the God of heaven and earth (n. 612). The reason why no others from Christians could learn this song, that is, acknowledge that the Lord alone is the God of heaven and earth is because they have imbibed from infancy the idea that there are three persons of the divinity distinct from each other; for it is said in the doctrine of the trinity, “There is one person of the Father, another of the son, and another of the Holy Spirit”; likewise, “the Father is God, the son is God, and the Holy Spirit is God”; and although it is there added, that these three are one, yet in their thought they have divided the Divine essence into three, which nevertheless cannot be divided; and for that reason they approach the Father, because he is first in order. And besides, the leaders in the church have taught, that they should pray to the Father to send the Holy Spirit for the sake of the son; by this their idea of three has been confirmed, so that they cannot think of the son as God, equal with the Father, and one with the Father, but of the son as"

That this was the reason of the Lord’s coming into the world, and of the glorification of his human, he fully teaches in John; for he says: In that day ye shall know, that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you (John 14:20). He that abideth in me and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit; for without me ye can do nothing; if anyone abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is dried up in the fire (John 15:5–6).

From which it clearly appears, that the Lord’s coming into the world, and the glorification of his human, had for its end the conjunction of men with God the Father in him and through him, thus that he is to be approached. This is also confirmed by the Lord’s so often saying, that they must believe in him, that they might have eternal life (see above, n. 553). [4] Who cannot see that all this is said by the Lord concerning himself in his human and that he never would have said, nor could say, that he was in men and men in him, and that it was necessary to believe in him, that they might have eternal life, if his human was not Divine? “To ask the Father in his name,” does not mean to approach God the Father immediately, nor to ask for his sake, but to approach the Lord, and the Father through him, because the Father is in the son, and they are one, as he himself teaches. This is what is signified by asking “in his name”; as may appear also from these passages: He that believeth not in the son is judged already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten son of God (John 3:18)."

Hence it is that Israel, Zion, and Jerusalem, in the Word, are called “virgins” and “daughters”; for by “Israel,” “Zion,” and “Jerusalem,” is signified the church. [2] That all they who are such in the Lord’s church, whether they be virgins or young men, wives or husbands, boys or old men, girls or old women, are meant by “virgins,” may appear from the Word, where virgins are mentioned, as “the virgin Israel” (Jer. 18:13; 31:4, 21; Amos 5:2; Joel 1:8). “The virgin daughter of Judah” (Lam. 1:15). “The virgin daughter of Zion” (2 Kings 19:21; Isa. 37:22; Lam. 1:4; 2:13). “The virgins of Jerusalem” (Lam. 2:10). “The virgin of my people” (Jer. 14:17). Therefore the Lord likened the church to “ten virgins” (Matt. 25:1, and following verses). And it is said in Jeremiah: I will build thee, and thou shalt be built, O virgin Israel, and shalt go forth in the dances of them that play (Jer. 31:4, 13). And in David: They have seen thy goings, O God, even the goings of my God, my king, in the sanctuary; among them were the virgins playing with timbrels (Ps. 68:24–25).

In the Israelitish church it was commanded that: The first of thy ripe fruits, of all corn, oil, and must, of the fruits of trees, as also of the fleece, should be given to Jehovah as holy, and they were given by Jehovah to Aaron, and after him to the high priest (Exod. 22:29; 23:10; Num. 13:20; 15:17–22; 18:8–20; Deut. 18:4; 26:1 seq.).

The reason was, because “the firstfruits” signified that which is born first, and afterwards grows, as an infant grows up to a man, or as a young plant grows up to a tree, and hence they signified all the subsequent stages even to the completion of the thing, for all that is to follow exists in the first, as the man in the infant, and the tree in the tender shoot; and as this first exists before its successions, in like manner in heaven and in the church, therefore “the firstfruits” were holy unto the Lord, and “the feast of the firstfruits” was celebrated."

Since “spots” signify falsities, therefore: It was forbidden that anyone of the seed of Aaron in whom there was a spot should approach the altar and enter within the veil (Lev. 21:17, 23).

By “another angel” is signified something new from the Lord; by “flying in the midst of heaven” is signified to look down on, to observe, and to provide for (n. 415), here something new out of heaven from the Lord in the church. By the “eternal gospel” is signified the annunciation of the coming of the Lord and of his kingdom (n. 478, 553). By “them that dwell on the earth,” are signified the men of the church to whom the annunciation will be made. The reason why it also means to announce that the new church is now about to descend out of heaven from him is because the Lord’s coming involves two things: the last judgment, and after it the new church. The last judgment is treated of in chapters 19–20, and the new church, which is the new Jerusalem, in chapters 21–22. That by “the gospel” and “proclaiming” is signified the annunciation of the coming of the Lord and of his kingdom, appears evidently from the passages cited in n. 478, which may there be seen. 627. And unto every nation, and tribe, and tongue, and people signifies to all who from religion are in goods and from doctrine in truths. By “nation” are signified they who are in goods, and abstractly goods (n. 483); by “tribe” is signified the church as to religion (n. 349); by “tongue” is signified doctrine (n. 282); and by “people” are signified they who are in truths, and abstractly truths (n. 483). Therefore by “proclaiming unto every nation, and tribe, and tongue, and people” is signified to announce it to all who are in goods from religion, and in truths from doctrine; for these and no others receive the gospel. Such is the signification of these words in the spiritual sense. 628. Verse 7. Saying with a great voice, Fear God signifies an admonition not to do evils, because this is against the Lord. By “a great voice” is signified admonition; and by “fearing God,” is signified not to do evils, because this is against the Lord. That “to fear God” is to love him, by fearing to do evil because it is against him, and that all love has within it this fear, may be seen above (n. 527).

And give glory to him, for the hour of his judgment is come signifies acknowledgment and confession that every truth of the Word, from which the church is a church is from the Lord, according to which every man will be judged. That “to give glory to him” signifies to acknowledge and confess that all truth is from the Lord, may be seen above (n. 249). And as every truth from which the church is a church is from the Word, therefore the truth of the Word is meant. “For the hour of his judgment is come” signifies, because every man will be judged according to the truth of the Word. This is signified, because by “giving glory to him” is signified to acknowledge and confess that every truth of the Word is from the Lord, and it is now said, “For the hour of the judgment is come,” and “for” involves this as the cause. That the truth of the Word will judge everyone, may be seen above (n. 233, 273); and that the church is from the Word, and its quality is according to its understanding of the Word, may be seen in Doctrine of the Sacred Scripture (n. 76–79). From these things it is evident that such is the spiritual sense of these words. The reason why it is such is because the angels of heaven by “glory” perceive nothing else than the Divine truth, and because all Divine truth is from the Lord, by “giving glory to him,” they perceive to acknowledge and confess that all truth is from him. For all glory in the heavens is from no other source, and so far as a society of heaven is in the Divine truth, so far all things there are resplendent, and so far the angels are in the splendor of glory. [2] That by “glory” is meant the Divine truth, may appear from the following passages:"

For by “heaven,” in the spiritual sense is signified the angelic heaven; by“the earth and the sea,” in that sense is signified the church internal and external (n. 403, 404, 420, 470), and by “fountains of waters” are signified all the truths of the Word serving the church for doctrine and life (n. 409).

Verse 8. And another angel followed, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city signifies that now the Roman Catholic religion as to its dogmas and doctrinals is dispersed. By “another angel” is signified now a new thing from the Lord, as above (n. 626). By “Babylon the great city,” is signified the Roman Catholic religion as to its dogmas and doctrinals. By “falling” is signified to be dispersed, for “to fall” is said of a city, but “to be dispersed” of a religion and its doctrine, as signified by “the city Babylon.” That “a city” signifies doctrine, see above (n. 194). The reason why this is now said of “Babylon,” is because after the new Christian heaven was made by the Lord, a new one was made at the same time of those who were of the Roman Catholic religion. The reason is because the Christian heaven collected out of the reformed constitutes the center, and the papists are round about it; therefore, when the center is made new, something new is at the same time produced in the circumference. For the Divine light, which is the Divine truth, diffuses itself around, from the middle as from a center, to the circumference, and reduces the things which are there also to order. On this account some mention is here made of Babylon, but it is treated of more particularly in chapters 17–18. That the reformed Christians constitute the center, and that the papists form a large circumference around it, and that spiritual light, which is the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord, diffuses itself as from its center to all the circumferences even to the last; may be seen in Doctrine of the Sacred Scripture (n. 104–113), and in the small work Last Judgment (n. 48). From these things it may be seen, that this mention of Babylon follows in order, after treating of the new Christian heaven and of evangelization; this is also what is signified by the expression “followed.”"

Because she made all nations drink of the wine of the anger of her whoredom signifies because by profanations of the Word, and adulterations of the good and truth of the church, she has seduced all whom she could subject to her dominion. By “Babylon” is signified the Roman Catholic religion as above. “Wine” signifies truth from good, and in the opposite sense, falsity from evil (n. 316); and “whoredom” signifies the falsification of truth, and the “anger of whoredom” signifies adulteration and profanation (n. 134). By “making all nations drink” is signified to seduce all whom they could subject to their dominion. By “making them drink” of that wine is signified to seduce, and by “nations” are signified those who are under their dominion. 633. Verse 9. And a third angel followed them, saying with a great voice signifies something further from the Lord concerning those who are in faith separated from charity. By “a third angel following them,” is signified something further from the Lord which follows in order, for by “an angel,” in the highest sense is meant the Lord (n. 626). The reason is because an angel, when he speaks the Word, as here, does not speak from himself, but from the Lord. By “saying with a great voice” is signified what follows, which relates to the damnation of those who in life and doctrine confirm themselves in faith separated from charity. This chapter, from verse 1 to 5, treats of the new Christian heaven; and in verses 6 and 7, of the preaching of the gospel, that is, of the Lord’s advent to establish the new church; and because they who are in faith separated from charity oppose this, there now follows a threatening and denunciation of damnation against those who still persist in that faith. 634.

[2] There are three degrees of the reception of that doctrine, which are described by these words. The first degree is to acknowledge that doctrine; the second degree is to confirm it in oneself; and the third degree is to live according to it; to acknowledge it is effected in the thought, to confirm it in oneself is effected in the understanding, and to live according to it is effected in the will. There are those who are in the first degree, and yet are not in the second and third; and there are those who are in the first and second, and yet are not in the third; but they who are in the third degree, which is that of living according to it, are those concerning whom the following verses (10–11), are spoken. To live according to it is to make nothing of evil, by thinking that evil does not condemn, because the works of the law do not save, but faith only. Also to make nothing of good, by thinking within oneself that no one can do good from himself, except it be meritorious. Thus they are such as only shun evils on account of the civil and moral laws, and not on account of the Divine laws; these are they who do goods only for the sake of themselves and the world, consequently from self-love, and not for the Lord’s sake, consequently not from love towards the neighbor. [3] The reason why what now follows (in verses 10–11) is said of these is because all that which enters only into the thought and into the understanding does not condemn, but that which enters into the will condemns; for this enters into the life, and remains. For nothing can enter into the will but what is also of the love, and the love is the life of man. These also are they who do not examine themselves, know their sins, and do the work of repentance, and therefore they are condemned; for they say in their hearts, “What need is there of examination, or of a knowledge and acknowledgment of sins, and of repentance, when all these are included in faith alone?” I have seen many such in the spiritual world, who have shunned evils and have done goods on account of"

He also shall drink of the wine of the anger of God mixed with unmixed wine in the cup of his wrath signifies that they falsify the goods and truths of the Word, and imbue the life with such falsifications. This is the signification of these words, because by “the wine of the anger of God mixed with unmixed wine” is signified the truth of the Word falsified. And by “the cup of his wrath,” is signified truth by which is good, in like manner falsified. And by “drinking” is signified to appropriate them, or to imbue the life with them. That by “wine” is signified the truth of the Word, may be seen (n. 316); by “the wine of the anger of God,” the truth of the Word adulterated and falsified (n. 632); by “mixed with unmixed wine” is evidently signified its being falsified; by “a cup” also, the like is signified as by “wine,” because a cup is that which contains it. The reason why “to drink” signifies to imbue the life with them is because this is said to those who live according to the doctrine of justification by faith alone; see above (n. 634). By “mixing wine” and by “mixture” is signified the falsification of truth, in David: In the hand of Jehovah there is a cup, and the wine is mixed, it is full of mixture, and he poureth it out, and all the wicked of the earth drink (Ps. 75:8). [2] In many parts of the Word “anger” and “wrath” are mentioned together, and in such cases “anger” is predicated of evil, and “wrath” of falsity, because they who are in evil are angry, and they who are in falsity are in wrath; and both in the Word are attributed to Jehovah, that is, to the Lord, but it is meant that they take place in man against the Lord; see above (n. 525). That, in the Word, “anger” and “wrath,” are mentioned together, appears from these passages: Jehovah cometh in wrath and anger; the earth shall remove out of her place, in the day of the wrath of his anger (Isa. 13:5, 9, 13)."

By “fire” is signified the love of self and of the world (n. 494); by “brimstone” are signified lusts derived from those two loves (n. 452); and since all torment in hell results from these three, therefore it is said, “shall be tormented with fire and brimstone, and the smoke of their torment shall go up for ages of ages.” It is said, “before the angels and the lamb,” because these loves are contrary to Divine truths and contrary to the Lord, who is the Word; for by “angels” Divine truths are signified, because they are recipients (n. 170), and by “the lamb” is signified the Lord as to the Divine human and also as to the Word (n. 595).

That this is the signification of these words, see above (n. 593). “To keep the commandments” signifies to live according to the precepts which are contained in a summary in the Decalogue; and by “the faith of Jesus” is signified faith in him, for these have faith from the Lord, which is the faith of Jesus. 639.

The reason why it relates to their state after death who will be of his new church is because that state is treated of in this verse; by “them that die henceforth,” is signified their state after death; “write” signifies that it may be for a remembrance to posterity (n. 39, 63).

Behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give to everyone according to his works (Rev. 22:12). I will give to every one of you according to his works (Rev. 2:23).

That by “the son of man” is meant the Lord as to the Word, see above (n. 44). The same is also abundantly proved in Doctrine of the Lord (n. 19–28).4 [2] The Lord frequently said: That they should see the son of man coming in the clouds of heaven (as in Matt. 16:27; 24:30; 26:64; Mark 14:61–62; Luke 21:27; 22:69). And no one knows that it has any other signification than that when he comes to judgment, he will appear in the clouds of heaven; but this is not meant, for the meaning is that when he comes to judgment, he will appear in the sense of the letter of the Word. And because he has come now, he has therefore appeared in the Word by revealing that there is a spiritual sense in every particular of the literal sense of the Word; that in it he alone is treated of; and that he alone is the God of heaven and earth. These are the things that are meant by his coming in the clouds of heaven. That there is a spiritual sense in every particular of the sense of the letter of the Word, and that in it the Lord alone is treated of, and that he alone is the God of heaven and earth is shown in the two doctrines of the new Jerusalem, one concerning the Lord, and the other concerning the sacred Scripture.

By “a cloud” is signified the sense of the letter of the Word, because that sense is natural, and Divine truth in natural light appears as a cloud before the eyes of angels who are in spiritual light; as a white cloud with those who are in genuine truths from the sense of the letter of the Word, as a dark cloud with those who are not in genuine truths, as a black cloud with those who are in falsities, and as a black cloud mingled with fire with those who are in faith separated from charity, because in evils of life.

That by “a crown upon the head” is signified wisdom, see above (n. 189, 252); and by “a golden crown,” wisdom from love (n. 235); and because it was seen upon the head of the son of man, or the Lord, by “a golden crown” is signified the Divine wisdom from his Divine love. The reason why “a sickle” signifies the Divine truth of the Word is because by “a harvest” is signified the state of the church as to the Divine truth, here its last state; and therefore by “reaping,” which is done with a sickle is here signified to put an end to the state of the church, and to execute judgment; and because these things are done by the Divine truth of the Word, therefore this is signified by “a sickle”; and by “a sharp sickle,” the doing it exactly and exquisitely. By “a sickle” the like is signified as by “a sword,” “a saber,” and “a long sword”; but “a sickle” is named where a harvest is treated of, and “a sword,” when war is treated of.

By “crying with a great voice to him that sat on the cloud,” is signified the supplication of the angels of heaven to the Lord, because there was not anything corresponding on the earth; for the church on earth is to the angelic heaven, as a foundation is to a house which rests upon it, or as the feet upon which a man stands, and by which he walks; wherefore, when the church on earth is destroyed, the angels lament, and make supplication to the Lord. They supplicate that he would make an end of the church, and raise up a new one. Hence it is that by “the angel cried with a great voice to him that sat on the cloud,” is signified the supplication of the angels of heaven to the Lord. That by “him that sat on the cloud” is signified the Lord as to the Word, see above (n. 642); that “to send his sickle and reap” signifies to make an end and execute judgment, see above (n. 642, 643).

[2] That this is the signification of this passage, may be seen more clearly from those places in the Word where “harvest,” “reaping” and “sickle” are mentioned, as in the following: I will sit to judge all the nations; put ye in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe; for their wickedness is great (Joel 3:12–13).

The husbandmen were ashamed, because the harvest of the field perished (Joel 1:11). Jesus said to the disciples, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest, lift up your eyes, and look on the fields, that they are white already to harvest. I sent you to reap (John 4:35–38). Jesus said to the disciples, The harvest is plenteous, but the laborers are few; pray ye the Lord of the harvest, that he will send forth laborers into his harvest (Matt. 9:37, 38; Luke 10:2). In these passages, and also in Isa. 16:9; Jer. 5:17; 8:20, the church as to the Divine truth is signified by “harvest.” [3] But all the things which are contained in these verses in this chapter, and also in the two chapters which follow, were foretold by the Lord in the parable concerning the sower and the gathering of the harvest; which, because it teaches and illustrates what they signify, shall be adduced: Jesus said, The kingdom of the heavens is like unto a man that sowed good seed in his field, but an enemy came and sowed tares; when the blade was sprung up, then appeared the tares also. The servants said, Wilt thou that we gather them up? but he said, Nay, lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up the wheat with them; let both grow together until the harvest, and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn; but gather the wheat into my barn. And the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Explain unto us the parable. Jesus said, He that soweth the good seed is the son of man (or the Lord); the field is the world (the church); the seed are the sons of the kingdom (the truths of the church); the tares are the sons of the wicked one (falsities from hell); the enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the consummation of the age (the end of the church); the reapers are the angels (the Divine truths): as therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire, so shall it be in the consummation of the age (at the end of the church) (Matt. 13:24–30, 36–43)."

By “harvest” is signified the state of the church, here its last state (n. 643, 645); and by “the earth” is signified the church (n. 285). From these connected into one sense, it appears, that by “him who sat on the cloud sending his sickle, and the earth being reaped” is signified the end of the church, because there is no longer any Divine truth therein. 647. And another angel went out of the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle signifies the heavens of the Lord’s spiritual kingdom, and the Divine truth of the Word with them. By “an angel” is signified, in the highest sense, the Lord, also the angelic heaven, and likewise the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord (see above, n. 5, 65, 170, 258, 342, 343, 344, 415, 465); but here by “an angel” the heavens of the spiritual kingdom are signified, and thence the Divine truths there, because it follows that “another angel went out from the altar,” by whom the heavens of the Lord’s celestial kingdom are signified, thus the Divine goods there, which will be treated of in the next article. There are two kingdoms into which all the heavens are distinguished, the spiritual kingdom and the celestial kingdom. The spiritual kingdom is the kingdom of the Lord’s wisdom, because the angels there are in wisdom from Divine truths from the Lord; and the celestial kingdom is the kingdom of the Lord’s love, because the angels there are in love from the Lord, and thence in all good.

These words involve things similar to what the Lord foretold in the parable of the sower and the gathering in of harvest, Matt. 13, as above cited (n. 645, at the end), where it is said that “the harvest is the consummation of the age,” that is, the end of the church, and that “the reapers are the angels,” by whom are signified Divine truths. For the angels are not sent to reap, that is, to do those things, but the Lord does them by the Divine truths of his Word; for the Lord says: The Word that I have spoken, it will judge in the last day (John 12:48). See above (n. 233, 273). 648. Verse 18.

By “another angel” the heavens of the Lord’s celestial kingdom are here signified, because he was seen to go out from the altar, for by “an altar” is signified the worship of the Lord from love, see above (n. 392), and by “fire” is signified love (n. 468), and by “fire upon the altar” is signified the Divine love (n. 395).

For by “vineyard” that church is signified (which will be further treated of in n. 651); and by “clusters” and “grapes” are signified works of charity. The reason why these are signified by “clusters” and “grapes,” is because they are the fruits of the vine in the vineyard, and by “fruits” in the Word are signified good works. [2] The reason why “the angel who went out from the altar, said to the angel who went out from the temple, that he should send his sickle and gather the vintage,” is because by “the angel who went out from the altar” the heavens of the celestial kingdom or the heavens which are in the goods of love are signified; and by “the angel who went out from the temple” the heavens of the spiritual kingdom or the heavens which are in the truths of wisdom are signified, as was said above, and the good of love does not operate anything from itself, but by the truth of wisdom, nor does the truth of wisdom operate anything from itself, but from the good of love. That this is the case is shown in many places in Divine Love and Wisdom. This is the reason why “the angel who went out from the altar” told “the angel who went out from the temple” “to send his sickle and gather the vintage, the clusters of the vineyard of the earth.” Hence then it is that by these words the Lord’s operation from the good of his love by the Divine truth of his Word is signified. [3] That “grapes” and “clusters” signify the goods and works of charity, may appear from the following passages: Woe unto me, I have become as the gatherings of the summer, as the grape gleanings of the vintage; there is no cluster to eat; my soul desires the firstfruits; the holy one has perished from the earth, and the upright among men (Micah 7:1–2).

That “to gather” is to take down the vine and gather the grapes, and that “to reap” signifies to cut down the harvest and gather the corn is evident. That “a vineyard” signifies the church where the Word is by which the Lord is known, thus here the Christian church, may appear from the following passages: Jesus said, I am the vine, ye are the branches; he that abideth in me and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit; for without me ye can do nothing. If anyone abide not in me, he is cast forth, and is as a dried branch in the fire (John 15:5–6).

By “casting the clusters of the vineyard into the winepress,” is signified to explore their works, for these are signified by “clusters,” as may be seen above (n. 649). But as it is called “the great winepress of the anger of God,” it signifies exploration of their works as being evil, for the “anger of God” is said of evil (n. 635). “A winepress” signifies exploration, because, in presses, must is pressed out from clusters, and oil from olives, and from the must and oil which are pressed out is perceived the quality of the grapes and olives. And as by “a vineyard” is signified the Christian church, and by its “clusters” are signified works, therefore the exploring of these with the men of the Christian church is signified by “casting them into the winepress.” But because they have separated faith from charity, and have made faith without the works of the law saving; and since from faith separated from charity none but evil works proceed, therefore it is called “the great winepress of the anger of God.” The exploration of works is also signified by a winepress in the following passages: My beloved hath a vineyard in the horn of a son of oil; he planted it with a noble vine, he also hewed out a winepress therein, and he looked that it should bring forth grapes, but it brought forth wild grapes (Isa. 5:1–2).

Wherefore art thou red as to thy garment, and thy garments like him that treadeth in the winepress? I have trodden the winepress alone (Isa. 63:1–3).

They who sat on the lowest benches appeared to me, at a distance, like satyrs and priapi, some with a slight covering and some naked without it. On the benches above them sat whoremongers and harlots; they appeared such to me from their gestures. And then the dragon said to me, “Now thou shalt see our sport.” And I saw, as it were, bullocks, rams, sheep, kids, and lambs, driven into the area of the circus, and when they were in, a gate was opened, and there rushed in, as it were, young lions, panthers, leopards, and wolves, which attacked the flock with fury, and tore them in pieces and slaughtered them. But the satyrs, when the bloody slaughter was over, strewed sand over the place of the slaughter. [2] Then the dragon said to me, “These are our sports which delight our minds.” And I replied, “Get thee hence, demon, in a short time thou wilt see this amphitheater converted into a lake of fire and sulphur.” At this he laughed and went away. And afterwards I was thinking within myself why such things are permitted by the Lord, and I received an answer in my heart, that they are permitted so long as they are in the world of spirits, but when the time of their stay in that world is at an end, those theatrical scenes are changed into such as are direful and infernal. [3] All the things which were seen were induced by the dragonists by fantasies; therefore they were not bullocks, rams, sheep, kids, and lambs, but the genuine goods and truths of the church, which they hold in hatred, they made to so appear. The young lions, panthers, leopards, and wolves were appearances of the lusts with those who seemed like satyrs and priapi. They who were without any covering, were such as believed that evils do not appear before God; and they who had a covering, were such as believed that they"

[4] After this I saw them going out of the forest, the dragon being in the midst of the satyrs and priapi, and after them, their servants and scullions, for such were the whoremongers and harlots. Their company increased in the way, and then it was given to hear what they were talking about among themselves. They were saying that they perceived a flock of sheep with lambs in a meadow, which was a sign that one of the cities of Jerusalem, where charity is primary, was near. And they said, “Let us go and take that city, and cast out its inhabitants, and plunder their goods.” They drew near; but there was a wall around it, and angel guards upon the wall. Then they said, “Let us take it by deceit; let us send one who is skilled in the art of mussitation, who can make black white, and white black, and can give to any object whatever color he pleases.” And there was found one who was expert in the art of metaphysics, who could change the ideas of things into the ideas of terms, and conceal the things themselves under formulas, and thus fly away, like a hawk, with his prey under his wings. He was instructed how to speak with the citizens, that they were in fellowship in religion, and that they should be admitted. Coming to the gate he knocked, and when it was opened, he said that he wished to speak with the wisest person in the city. Then he entered and was conducted to one whom he thus addressed, saying, “There are some of my brethren without the city who request to be received. They are consociates in religion. You and we make faith and charity the two essentials of religion; the only difference is that you say charity is primary and faith is thence, whereas we say that faith is primary and charity is thence. But what matters it whether one or the other is called the primary when both are believed in?”"

And then the wise man of the city replied, “Thou hast said that it is the same thing whether charity or faith be assumed as the primary of the church, provided it be agreed that each constitutes the church and its religion. And yet the difference between them is the same as between prior and posterior, between cause and effect, between the principal and the instrumental, and between the essential and the formal. I speak in this manner, because I have observed that thou art expert in the art of metaphysics, which art we call mussitation, and some call it incantation. But let us leave these terms. The difference is the same as between what is above and what is below; yea! if you will believe it, the difference is as between heaven and hell; for that which is primary constitutes the head and the breast, and that which is thence derived, the feet and the soles of the feet. But let us first agree what charity is and what faith is. Charity is the affection of the love of doing good to the neighbor for the sake of God, salvation, and eternal life, and faith is thought from confidence concerning God, salvation, and eternal life.” [6] But the emissary said, “I concede that this is faith, and I also concede that charity is that affection for the sake of God, because for the sake of his command; but not for the sake of salvation and eternal life.” And the wise man of the city said, “Let it be this, provided it is for the sake of God.” After this agreement the wise man of the city said, “Is not affection the primary? And is not thought from it?” But he that was sent by the dragon said, “This I deny.” But he received for answer, “You cannot deny it. Does not a man think from affection? Take away affection, and can you think anything? It is altogether as if you should take away sound from speech. If you take away sound, can you speak anything? Sound also is of the affection, and speech is of the thought; for the affection sounds, and the thought speaks. And it is also like flame and light. If you take away the flame, does not the light perish?"

Can you not thus comprehend that the primary is the all in the secondary, altogether as the sound is in speech? From which you may see, that if you do not make that to be the primary which is the primary, you are not in the other. Wherefore, if you take faith, which is in the second place, and put it in the first, you will not appear otherwise in heaven than as a man inverted, whose feet stand upwards, and his head downwards; or like a mountebank, who, with his body upside down, walks upon the palms of his hands. When ye appear such in heaven, what then are your good works, which are charity, but such as that mountebank would do with his feet, because he cannot with his hands? Hence it is that your charity, as you also have seen, is natural and not spiritual because it is inverted.” [7] The emissary understood this; for every devil can understand truth, when he hears it; but he cannot retain it, because when the affection of evil returns, it casts out the thought of truth. And afterwards the wise man of the city described by many things what the quality of faith is when it is received as the primary, that it is merely natural; and that it is mere science, without any spiritual life; consequently, that it is not faith. “For your charity is nothing but natural affection; and from natural affection no other than natural thought proceeds, which is your faith. And I may almost say, that in merely natural faith there is scarce any more that is spiritual, than in a knowledge of the kingdom of the Mogul, of the diamond mine there, and of the treasure and court of the emperor.” Hearing this, the dragonist went away in a rage, and reported to his friends without the city. And when they heard that it was said that charity is the affection of the love of doing good to the neighbor for the sake of God, of salvation, and of eternal life, they all cried out, “This is a lie”; and the dragon himself exclaimed, “O the wickedness, are not all the good works which are charity, when done for the sake of salvation, meritorious?” [8] Then they said among themselves, “Let us call together still more of our friends, and we will besiege this city; let us make"

But the fire from heaven was an appearance of their anger from hatred against the others, because they rejected faith from the first place into the second. The reason that they appeared to be consumed as if by fire, was because hell was opened under their feet, and swallowed them up. Things similar to this happened in many places at the time of the last judgment, and this is what is meant by these words in Revelation: The dragon shall go out to seduce the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, to gather them together to war; and they went up on the plain of the earth, and encompassed the camp of the saints, and the beloved city; but fire came down from God out of heaven, and consumed them (Rev. 20:8–9)."

Seven angels having the seven last plagues signifies the evils and falsities in the church, such as are in its last state, universally disclosed by the Lord. By “seven angels” the entire heaven is signified; but as heaven is not heaven from anything proper to the angels, but from the Lord, therefore by “seven angels” the Lord is signified, nor can any other disclose the evils and falsities which are in the church. That by “angels” is signified heaven, and, in the highest sense, the Lord, may be seen above (n. 5, 258, 344, 465, 644, 647, 648). By “plagues” are signified evils and falsities, evils of love and falsities of faith. For they are those which are described in the next chapter and are signified by “evil and noxious sores,” by “the blood as it were of one dead, whereby every living soul died,” and by “the blood into which the waters of the rivers and fountains were turned,” by “the scorching of fire which afflicted men,” by “the unclean spirits like frogs, which were demons,” and by “great hail”; the evils and falsities which are signified by all these things, are here meant by “plagues”; by “the last plagues” are signified the same in the last state of the church; by “seven” are signified all (n. 10, 390); but because these evils, which are signified by “the plagues” in the next chapter, are not all in particular, but are all in general, by “seven” are here signified all universally, for the universal embraces all the particulars. From these things it appears, that by “I saw seven angels having the seven last plagues,” is signified that the evils and falsities in the church, such as they are in its last state, were disclosed universally by the Lord. [2] That “plagues” signify spiritual plagues, which affect men as to their souls, and destroy them, which are evils and falsities, may appear from the following passages: From the sole of the foot even to the head there is no soundness, a fresh plague not pressed out, nor bound up, nor mollified (Isa. 1:6). Jehovah smiteth the people in anger with an incurable plague (Isa. 14:6)."

If thou wilt not observe to do all the words of the law, Jehovah will make thy plagues wonderful, plagues great and lasting, and every plague which is not written in the book of this law, even until thou art destroyed (Deut. 28:58, 59, 61).

It shall be a devastation; everyone that passeth by Babylon shall be astonished, and shall hiss at all her plagues (Jer. 50:13). In one day shall plagues come upon Babylon (Rev. 18:8). The two witnesses shall smite the earth with every plague (Rev. 11:6). By “the plagues of Egypt,” which were in part similar to the plagues described in the following chapter, nothing else was signified but evils and falsities; which plagues you may see enumerated above (n. 503) they are also called “plagues” (Exod. 9:14; 11:1). From this it is manifest, that by “plagues” nothing else is signified but spiritual plagues, which affect men as to their souls, and destroy them; as also Isa. 30:26; Zech. 14:12, 15; Ps. 38:5, 11; Rev. 9:20; 16:21; Exod. 12:13; 30:12; Num. 11:33; Luke 7:21; and elsewhere. 658.

It is said that in those plagues “the anger of God is consummated,” and that thereby is signified the devastation of the church and then its end; the reason shall be explained. Every church, in process of time, decreases, by receding from the good of love and the truths of faith, until there is nothing of them left; and this takes place by the successive increase of evil and falsity; and when there is no longer any good of love and faith, then there is nothing but evil and falsity; and when this is the case, there is an end of the church. In this end, man knows no other than that evil is good and falsity truth, for he loves them from the delight he feels in them, and therefore confirms them. [2] This is the end which is signified by “consummation,” and is called “devastation,” in the following passages: I have heard a consummation and decision from Jehovah upon the whole earth (Isa. 28:22). The consummation being decreed, justice has overflowed, for the Lord Jehovih of Hosts maketh a consummation and decision in the whole earth (Isa. 10:22–23). In the fire of the zeal of Jehovah shall the whole earth be eaten up, for he shall make a speedy consummation with all the inhabitants of the earth (Zeph. 1:18). At length upon the bird of abominations there shall be desolation, and even to a consummation and decision shall it drop upon the devastation (Dan. 9:27). The whole earth shall be a waste, yet will I not make a consummation (Jer. 4:27).Jehovah said, I will go down, and will see whether they have made a consummation according to the cry which is to come unto me (Gen. 18:21)."

At the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares to burn; gather the wheat into the barn; so shall it be in the consummation of the age (Matt. 13:30, 40). In the consummation of the age, the angels shall go forth, and shall separate the evil from among the just (Matt. 13:49).

Verse 2.

They who are in general truths, are also in the borders of heaven; therefore at a distance they appear to be in the sea (n. 398, 403, 405). But here by “the sea of glass” is signified the ultimate boundary of the spiritual world, where those were collected who have religion and thence worship, but not the good of life. Because a collection of these is signified, therefore it is said, “as it were a sea of glass,” and further, it appeared “mingled with fire,” and by “fire” there is signified the love of evil, and thence the evil of life (n. 452, 468, 494, 766–767, 787); thus not the good of life, for where good is not, there evil is.

They were those who had religion, frequented churches, listened to preachings, received the holy supper, but never thought any further about God, salvation, and eternal life, not knowing what sin is. Therefore they were men as to the face; and many of them as to civil and moral life, but not at all as to spiritual life, by virtue of which nevertheless man is man. 660.

By “mark” is signified the acknowledgment of that faith (n. 605, 606, 634, 637, 679). By “the number of his name” is signified the falsification of the Word (n. 610). Hence it appears, that by these words they are signified who have rejected faith alone and its doctrine, and thus have not acknowledged and imbued its falsities, nor falsified the Word. 661. Standing by the sea of glass, having the harps of God signifies the Christian heaven in its boundaries and the faith of charity with those who are there, since “by the sea of glass” is signified a collection of those who have indeed some religion and worship, but not the good of life (n. 659). Therefore, by those who were seen “standing by that sea,” is signified the Christian heaven in its boundaries, with whom there were religion, worship, and the good of life, because “they had the victory over the beast and over his image.” The higher Christian heaven is treated of in the foregoing chapter; they who composed that heaven are meant by “the hundred forty-four thousand,” who were seen standing with the lamb on mount Zion (n. 612–625).

That everything written in those books is called “the law of Moses,” and also “Moses,” may appear from the following passages: Philip1 said, We have found Jesus, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write (John 1:45). In the law Moses commanded that such should be stoned (John 8:5). The days of their purification, according to the law of Moses, were fulfilled (Luke 2:22). All things must be fulfilled which are written in the law of Moses and in the prophets concerning me (Luke 24:27, 44). Did not Moses give you the law? Moses gave circumcision; that the law of Moses should not be broken (John 7:19, 22–23). Abraham said to the rich man in hell, They have Moses and the prophets, let them hear them; if they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded if one rose from the dead (Luke 16:29, 31). The curse is poured upon us and the oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of God; as it is written in the law of Moses, all this evil hath come upon us (Dan. 9:11, 13). Remember the law of Moses the servant of God, which I commanded him (Mal. 4:4). Jehovah said unto Moses, Behold, I will come unto thee in the mist of a cloud, that the people may hear when I shall speak unto thee, and may also believe in thee forever (Exod. 19:9). [3] It may be evident from these passages, that by “Moses” in the wide sense is meant the Word that was written by him, which is called the law. It follows from this, that the law which is the Decalogue is meant by “Moses”; and the more so, because Moses hewed out the tables after he had broken the former ones (Exod. 34:1, 4); and when he carried them down, his face was radiant (Exod. 34:29–35); on which account Moses is represented in pictures holding these tables in his hand.

That law was the Decalogue. From these things it may be seen, that nothing else is here meant by “the song of Moses the servant of God,” but confession from charity, and thus from life according to the commandments of the law, which are the Decalogue. 663. Saying, Great and marvelous are thy works, O Lord God almighty signifies that all things of the world, of heaven, and of the church, were created and made by the Lord from his Divine love by his Divine wisdom. By “the works of the Lord” are signified all thing which were created and made by him, these being in general all things of the world, all things of heaven, and all things of the church, which it is not possible to enumerate particularly. They are called “great and marvelous,” because “great” is said of love, and “marvelous” of wisdom, as above (n. 656). The Lord is also in the Word called “Lord” from the Divine good of the Divine love, and “God” from the Divine truth of the Divine wisdom. That the Lord is called “almighty” because he is, lives, and does all things from himself, and also rules all things from himself, may be seen above (n. 31). Hence it is that by “great and marvelous are thy works, O Lord God almighty,” in the universal sense, is signified that all things of the world, of heaven, and of the church, were created and made by the Lord from his Divine love by his Divine wisdom. 664. Because just and true are thy ways, O king of saints signifies that all things which proceed from him are just and true, because he is the Divine good and the Divine truth itself in heaven and in the church. By “ways” are signified truths leading to good (n. 176), and by “king,” when speaking of the Lord, is signified the Divine truth, and by “king of saints,” the Divine truth in heaven and in the church from him; for by “saints” are signified they who are in Divine truths from the Lord (n. 173, 586). Hence by “just and true are thy ways, O king of saints,” is signified that all things which proceed from the Lord are just and true, because he is the Divine truth itself in heaven and in the church.

The reason why the Lord, as king, is the Divine truth is because this is signified by “a king” (n. 20, 483). Hence it is that by “kings” are signified they who are in Divine truths from the Lord (Rev. 1:6; 5:10). It is on this account that heaven and the church are called his “kingdom.” Then his coming into the world is called the gospel of the kingdom. Heaven and the church are called “his kingdom” (Dan. 2:44; 7:13, 14, 27; Matt. 12:28; 16:28; Mark 1:14, 15; 9:1; 15:43; Luke 1:33; 4:43; 8:1, 10; 9:2, 11, 27; 10:11; 16:16; 19:11; 21:31; 22:18; 23:51). And his coming is called “the gospel of the kingdom” (Matt. 4:23; 9:35; 24:14). But more may be seen on this subject in Doctrine of the Lord. [2] That the Lord is called king is evident from the following passages: They shall make war with the lamb, but the lamb shall overcome them, because he is Lord of lords and king of kings (Rev. 17:14). He that sitteth upon the white horse is called the Word, and his name is Lord of lords and king of kings (Rev. 19:13, 16; Dan. 2:47). Nathanael said, Thou art the son of God, thou art the king of Israel (John 1:49). When the son of man shall come in his glory, he shall sit upon the throne of his glory, and the king shall say to them that are on his right hand and on his left (Matt. 25:31, 34, 41). They cried, Hosanna, blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord, the king of Israel (John 12:13). Pilate asked Jesus whether he was a king. Jesus answered, I am a king; for this I was born, and for this I came into the world (John 18:37).

I will raise up unto David a just branch, who shall reign king, and shall do judgment and justice in the earth (Jer. 23:5; 33:15; besides other places, as Isa. 6:5; 52:7; Jer. 10:7, 10; 46:18; Ezek. 37:22, 24; Zeph. 3:15; Ps. 20:9; 45:11, 13, 15; 68:24; 74:12). 665. Verse 4. Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name? signifies that he alone is to be loved and worshiped. “To fear God” signifies to love him; and “to glorify his name” signifies to worship him. That he alone is to be loved and worshiped is meant by “who shall not,” and by “because thou alone art holy.” That to fear God is to love him, by fearing to do what is contrary to him, and that such fear is in all love, see above (n. 527, 628). That “to glorify his name” is to worship him is because by “the name” of Jehovah is signified everything by which he is worshiped (n. 81), and “to glorify” signifies to acknowledge and confess. 666. For thou alone art holy signifies that he is the Word, the truth, and enlightenment. That the Lord alone is holy, see above (n. 173); and that it is the Divine truth which is called holy (n. 173, 580); and as the Word is Divine truth, and the Lord is that, and as the Divine truth spiritually enlightens, for it is light in heaven, but from the Lord, therefore by, “because he alone is holy,” is signified that the Lord is the Word, the truth, and enlightenment. Since the Word is the Divine truth, and the Divine truth spiritually enlightens, therefore it is said that the Word was dictated by Jehovah through the Holy Spirit, and that the Holy Spirit enlightens and teaches man; but who does not know that God is omnipresent, and that what is holy proceeds from him, and that where he is received he enlightens?

By “all nations” are signified they who are in the good of love and charity; that these are meant by “nations,” in a good sense, may be seen above (n. 483). “To come and adore before him” signifies to acknowledge the Lord as God, and as there is one God in whom there is the trinity, and that the Lord is he, it signifies to acknowledge him alone as God. 668. Because thy judgments are made manifest signifies that the truths of the Word, when opened, testify it. By “judgments” are signified Divine truths, according to which man should live, from which his quality is known, and according to which he will be judged; and because those Divine truths are in the Word, and the Word is now opened, and this testifies that the Lord alone is the God of heaven and earth, therefore by “because thy judgments are made manifest” is signified because the truths of the Word testify it. That the Word is now opened, and that it testifies that the Lord alone is the God of heaven and earth, and that one ought to live according to his commandments, and that the faith of the present day should be removed, may appear from the four doctrines just published, Doctrine of the Lord, Doctrine of the Sacred Scripture, Doctrine of Life, and Doctrine of Faith; these are meant by “because thy judgments are made manifest.” [2] Since the Lord is the Divine good and the Divine truth, and since by “judgment” is signified the Divine truth, and by “justice” the Divine good, therefore, in many passages where the Lord is"

That the Lord’s government in the celestial kingdom is called justice, and in the spiritual kingdom judgment, may be seen in the work Heaven and Hell published at London (n. 214–216). 669. Verse 5.

By “the tabernacle of the testimony” is signified the inmost of that heaven, where the Lord is, in his holiness in the Word, and in the law, which is the Decalogue, because “the tabernacle” likewise signifies heaven (n. 585), and the inmost of the tabernacle was where the ark was, in which were the two tables, upon which the ten words were written with the finger of God, which are the ten commandments of the Decalogue, which are meant by “the testimony,” and also are called “the testimony”; from which it is evident, that by “I saw, and behold, the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened,” is signified that the inmost of heaven was seen, where the Lord is in his holiness in the law which is the Decalogue. “The tabernacle of the testimony” also signifies where the Word is because “the testimony” is mentioned not only in relation to the law, which is the Decalogue, but also to the Word, and to the Lord as the Word, because the Word testifies of him (n. 490, 555). [2] That the Word is in heaven, and is deposited in the inmost part thereof, which is called the sacred repository, and that the light there is flaming and bright, exceeding every degree of light that shines without in the other parts of heaven, may be seen in Doctrine of the Sacred Scripture (n. 70–75), and concerning that"

Respecting the holiness of the law, which is the Decalogue, see the Doctrine of Life for the New Jerusalem from the Commandments of the Decalogue (n. 53–60). That the ark, in which were contained the two tables of the Decalogue, constituted the sanctuary or inmost part of the temple in Jerusalem, and consequently of the tabernacle there, see 1 Kings 6:19–28; 8:3–9. That the law which is the Decalogue was called the testimony is evident from these passages: Moses came down, and the two tables of the testimon y were in his hand; the tables were the work of God; the writing was the writing of God, graven upon the tables (Exod. 32:15–16). The two tables of the testimony, tables of stone, written by the finger of God (Exod. 31:18). Jehovah said, Thou shalt put i nto the ark the testimony which I will give thee (Exod. 25:16, 21–22). And Moses took and put the testimony into the ark (Exod. 40:20). That the cloud of incense may cover the mercy seat which is upon the testimony (Lev. 16:13). Jehovah said unto Moses, Leave the rods before the testimony, and afterwards Aaron’s rod before the testimony (Num. 17:4, 10). And Moses left the rods before Jehovah (Num. 17:7). The ark is called the ark of the testimony (Exod. 31:7). And the tabernacle is called the habitation of the testimony (Exod. 38:21). 670. Verse 6.

That this was done for the sake of separating them from the good will be seen in the next chapter. 671. Clothed in linen, clean and bright, and girded about the breasts with golden girdles signifies this from the pure and genuine truths and goods of the Word. By “linen clean and bright” is signified truth pure and genuine, as will be seen presently. By “the golden girdle about the breast” is signified the proceeding and at the same time conjoining Divine, which is the Divine good, as above (n. 46). By “being clothed and girded” is signified to appear and be presented in them; for garments signify truths clothing good (n. 166); and zones or girdles signify containing truths and goods in their order and connection (n. 46). From these things it is evident, that by “angels clothed in linen, clean and bright, and having their breasts girded about with golden girdles,” are signified truths and goods pure and genuine, which because they are from no other source than the Word signify the truths and goods of the Word. [2] That “linen” signifies Divine truth, may appear from the following passages, as that: Aaron had breeches of linen, when he entered into the tent, and drew near to the altar (Exod. 28:42–43). When Aaron entered into the holy place, he put on the linen coat of holiness, breeches of linen were upon his flesh; with a linen belt he girdled himself, and put upon himself the linen miter; these were the garments of holiness, and he put on the same garments, when he made atonement for the people (Lev. 16:4, 32).

That “the four animals,” which are cherubim signify the Word in ultimates, and guards lest its genuine truths and goods should be violated, may be seen above (n. 239); and because the interior truths and goods of the Word are guarded by the sense of its letter, that sense of the Word is therefore signified by “one of the four animals.” The same is signified by “the seven vials” as by “the seven plagues,” for they are that which contains; and that which contains in the Word signifies the same as the things which are contained; as by “a cup” the same as by “wine,” and by “a platter” the same as by “food.” That by “cups,” “goblets,” “vials,” and “plates,” similar things are signified as by their contents, will be seen in what now follows. What is signified by “the seven angels” has been said above.

By “the temple,” the inmost of heaven is signified, as shown above (n. 669). By “smoke” is signified the Divine in the ultimates, as will be seen presently. By “glory” is signified spiritual Divine truth (n. 249, 629); and by “power” celestial Divine truth is signified (n. 373). Hence by “the temple being filled with the smoke from the glory of God and from his power,” is signified the inmost heaven full of Divine truth spiritual and celestial. “Smoke” signifies the Divine truth in ultimates, because “fire,” from which is smoke signifies love; “the fire of the altar of burnt offering,” celestial love (n. 395, 494); and “the fire of the altar of incense,” spiritual love (n. 277, 392, 394). That “smoke” signifies these things may be evident from these passages: Jehovah will create upon every habitation of mount Zion a cloud by day, and smoke and the brightness of fire by night; for upon all the glory shall be a covering (Isa. 4:5). The posts of the threshold were moved at the voice of the seraphim that cried, and the house was filled with smoke (Isa. 6:4). The smoke of the incense went up with the prayers of the saints7 out of the hand of the angel before God (Rev. 8:4). The smoking flax shall he not quench, he shall bring forth judgment into truth (Isa. 42:3). That “smoke” in the opposite sense signifies the falsities of lusts, may be seen above (n. 422); and falsities originating from the pride of one’s own intelligence (n. 452). Also “smoke” in many places signifies the same as “a cloud.” 674b.

And by “the seven plagues of the seven angels,” the evils and falsities which devastate the church and make an end of it are signified (n. 657). 675. To this I will add this relation. There was seen a certain paper sent down from the Lord through heaven to a society of the English, but that society was one of the smallest of them, where also there were two bishops. The paper contained an exhortation that they should acknowledge the Lord as the God of heaven and earth, as he taught (Matt. 28:18); and that they should recede from the doctrine of justifying faith without the works of the law, because it is erroneous. This paper was read and copied by many; and respecting the things that were in it they thought and spoke soundly from interior judgment, and were enlightened by the Lord; and the enlightenment was received in the light, which is implanted with the English more than with others. Yet after they had received those things, they said among themselves, “Let us hear the bishops.” And they were heard; but they contradicted and disapproved. For those bishops who were there were of those who had become in the world hard of heart as to the spiritual things of faith and charity, from the love of dominion over the holy things of the church, and of supereminence by means of them even in political affairs. Wherefore, after a short consultation among themselves, they sent the paper back to heaven, whence it came. This being done, after some murmuring, most of the laity receded from their former assent; and then their light in spiritual things, which before shone brightly, was suddenly extinguished; and they were afterwards admonished again, but in vain. I saw that society sinking down, but how deeply I did not see, thus it was withdrawn from the sight of the angels, who worship the Lord alone, and are averse to faith alone."

After a day we consulted among ourselves what was to be done. Many said that we must go to the two bishops, and mildly argue with them, because they sent back the paper into heaven, whence it was let down; on account of which this had happened to us. They chose some, who went to the bishops,” and he that was speaking with me said that he was one of them. “And then a certain one among us who excelled in wisdom, addressed the bishops thus. ‘Hear, ye fathers; we believed that with us above others was the church which deserved to be called the first in the Christian world, and a religion which deserves to be called the greatest. But there has been given to us enlightenment from heaven, and in the enlightenment a perception that at this day there is no longer any church in the Christian world, nor any religion.’ [3] The bishops said ‘What are you saying? Is not the church where the Word is, where Christ the savior is known, and where are the sacraments?’ To this our spokesman replied, ‘Those things are the church, and they make the church; but they do not make it outside of man, but within man.’ And he said further, ‘As to the church: can the church be where three gods are worshiped? Can the church be where the whole of its doctrine is founded upon a single saying of Paul falsely understood, and hence not upon the Word? Can the church be where the savior of the world is not approached, and where he is divided into two? As to religion: who can deny that religion is to shun evil and to do good? Is there any religion where it is taught that faith alone saves, and not charity? Is there religion where it is taught that charity proceeding from a man is nothing but moral and civil charity? Who does not see that in that charity there is not anything of religion? Is there in faith alone anything of deed or of work? And yet religion consists in doing. Is there given in the entire world a nation with any religion, which excludes everything saving from the goods of charity, which are good works, when yet the all of religion consists in good, and the all of the"

See, fathers, what glory we should have, if the church, which is not, and religion, which is not, should begin and arise with us.’ [4] Then those bishops replied, ‘You speak too loftily. Is not faith in act, which is faith fully justifying and saving, the church? And is not faith in state, which is faith proceeding and perfecting religion? Apprehend this, O sons.’ But the wise Englishman then said, ‘Hear, O fathers; does not a man conceive faith in act like a stock? Is the church, according to your idea, in a stock that is then vivified? Is not faith in state the continuation and progression of faith in act? And since according to your idea everything saving is in faith, and not anything in the good of charity from man, where then is religion?’ The bishops then said, ‘Friend, you speak thus, because you do not know the mysteries of justification by faith alone; and he who does not know them, does not know the way of salvation from within. Your way is an external and plebeian way. Go that way if you will; but know only that all good is from God, and nothing from man; and that thus in spiritual things a man can do nothing at all of himself. How then can a man do good, which is spiritual good, from himself?’ [5] The Englishman that was speaking with them, being indignant at this, said, ‘I know your mysteries of justification better than you do yourselves; and I tell you plainly, that in these interior mysteries of yours I have seen nothing but specters. Is not religion to acknowledge and love God, and to shun and hate the devil? Is not God good itself, and the devil evil itself? Who in the whole world, who has any religion, does not know this? Is not acknowledging and loving God the doing of good because this is of God and from God? And is not shunning and hating the devil, to do no evil, because it is of the devil and from the devil? Your faith in act, which you called faith fully justifying and saving, or, what is the same, your act of justification by faith alone, does it teach the doing of any good which is of God and from God? And does it teach the shunning of any evil which is of the devil and from the devil? Nothing at all, because you have decided that there is nothing of salvation in either.

How can this be perfected, when you exclude all good done by man as of himself by saying, “How can a man be saved by any good from himself, when salvation is gratuitous?” Also, “What good is from man but meritorious good? And yet Christ’s merit is all; and therefore to do good for the sake of salvation would be to attribute to oneself what is Christ’s alone; and thus it would be also to will to justify and save oneself.” Also, “How can anyone operate good, when the Holy Spirit operates all things without any help from man? What need is there then of any accessory good from man, when all the good from man is in itself not good?” and more besides. [6] ‘Are not these your mysteries? But in my eyes they are mere subtleties and artifices contrived for the end that you may remove good works, which are the goods of charity, to establish your faith alone. And because you do this, you regard man as to these things, and in general as to all spiritual things which are of the church and religion, as a stock, or as a lifeless image, and not as a man created in the image of God, to whom was given, and is continually given, the faculty of understanding and willing, of believing and loving, and of speaking and doing, altogether as of himself; especially in spiritual things, because man is man from them. If man did not think and operate as of himself in spiritual things, what then would faith be, and charity, and worship? Yea, what then would the church and religion be? You know that charity is to do good to the neighbor from love. Yet you do not know what charity is; when yet charity is the soul, the life, and the essence of faith. And because charity is all that, what then is faith when charity is removed, but dead faith? And dead faith is nothing but a specter. I call it a specter, because the apostle James calls faith without good works not only dead, but also diabolical.’ [7] Then one of those two bishops, when he heard his faith called dead, diabolical, and a specter, became so enraged, that he snatched the miter from his head, and threw it upon a table, saying, ‘I will not resume it until I have been avenged on the enemies of the faith of our church.’ And he shook his head, murmuring and saying, ‘That James, that James!’ Upon the miter was a plate, on which was engraved ‘faith alone.’ And then there suddenly appeared a monster"

This is a summary of what is contained in this chapter. By “the temple” is signified the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony, mentioned in the foregoing chapter (Rev. 15:5), whereby is signified the inmost of heaven, where the Lord is in his holiness in the Word, and in the Law which is the Decalogue (n. 669).

By “pouring out the vials upon the earth,” which contained the plagues, is signified influx into the church of the reformed; by “pouring out the vials” is signified the influx, and by “the earth” is signified the church (n. 285).

By “the seven trumpets” which the seven angels sounded is signified the exploration and manifestation of the falsities and evils, in which they are who are in faith separated from charity; but by “the seven vials full of the seven last plagues” is signified their devastation and consummation, for the last judgment is not executed upon them until they are devastated. [3] Devastation and consummation in the spiritual world take place in this manner: From those who are in falsities as to doctrine, and thence in evils as to life, are taken away all the goods and truths which they possessed only in the natural man, and from which they simulated Christian men; on being deprived of which, they are separated from heaven and conjoined with hell. And then they are arranged into societies in the world of spirits according to the varieties of lusts, and afterwards these societies sink down. [4] They are deprived of goods and truths by an influx from heaven. The influx is effected from genuine truths and goods, by which they are tortured and tormented; scarcely otherwise than as a serpent when put near a fire, or thrown upon an ant hill. Therefore they reject from themselves the goods and truths of heaven, which are also the goods and truths of the church, and at last they condemn them because they feel as if infernal torment proceeded from them. When this has come to pass, they enter into their own evils and falsities, and are separated from the good. These are the things which are described and signified in this chapter by “the pouring out of the vials, wherein were the seven last plagues.” The vials did not contain the evils and falsities signified by “the plagues,” but they were genuine truths and goods, the effect of which was such as has been described.

By “noxious” is signified what is destructive, for evil cannot but destroy good, and falsity truth. “A sore” has this signification because the sores of the body originate from a corrupt state of the blood, or from some other interior malignity. It is the same with sores meant in the spiritual sense; these originate from lusts and their delights, which are interior causes. The evil itself which is signified by “a sore” and which appears in externals as delightful, conceals within it the lusts whence it originates, and of which it is composed. [2] It should be clearly known, that the interiors of the human mind exist in successive order and in simultaneous order with everyone. They are in successive order from its higher or prior things to its lower or posterior things. They are in simultaneous order in the ultimates or postremes, but in these latter they exist from interior things to exterior, as from a center to its circumference. This is shown in many places in Divine Love and Wisdom (n. 173–281), where degrees are treated of; from which it is evident that the ultimate is the complex of all the prior things. Hence it follows, that all the lusts of evil exist in simultaneous order inwardly in the very evil which the man perceives in himself, every evil which a man perceives in himself being in ultimates; for which reason when a man rejects evil from himself, he at the same time rejects its lusts; but still not from himself, but from the Lord. A man can indeed of himself reject evil, but not its lusts; wherefore, when he wills to reject evil, by fighting against it, he will look up to the Lord; for the Lord operates from inmosts to ultimates, for he enters through the soul of man, and purifies him. These things are said that it may be known that “a sore” signifies the evil appearing in ultimates or extremes, and originating from internal malignity. This takes place with all who persuade themselves that faith alone"

[3] “Ulcers” and “wounds” signify evils in the extremes, springing from interior evils, which are lusts, also in the following passages: From the sole of the foot even to the h ead there is no soundness; wound and scar, and a fresh stroke; they have not been pressed out nor bound up, nor softened with oil (Isa. 1:6). My iniquities have gone over my head; my wounds have putrefied, they have wasted away, because of my foolishness (Ps. 38:4–5). In the day that Jehovah shall bind up the breach of his people, and shall heal the wound of their stroke (Isa. 30:26). If thou wilt not obey the voice of Jehovah, observing to do his commandments, Jehovah will smite thee with the sore of Egypt, with emerods and with the scab, and with the itch, and with an evil sore upon the knees and thighs, of which thou canst not be healed, from the sole of the foot even to thy crown (Deut. 28:15, 27, 35). The sore with blains breaking out on man and on beast in Egypt (Exod. 9:8–11) signifies nothing else; for the miracles done there signify the evils and falsities in which they were. And because the Jewish nation was in the profanation of the Word, and this is signified by leprosy, therefore they had leprosy not only in their flesh, but also in their garments, houses, and vessels; and the kinds of profanation are signified by the various evils of leprosy, which were: Tumors, ulcerous tumors, white and red pimples, abscesses, burnings, tetters, scurfs, etc. (Lev. 13:1 to the end).

By living faith alone and receiving its doctrine is meant to make no account of life for the sake of salvation, nor of any truth, believing that if they only pray to God the Father, to have mercy for the son’s sake, they will be saved. This is especially the case with those who know and acknowledge the interiors of that doctrine; such being here treated of, see above (n. 677). 680. Verse 3. And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea signifies an influx of truth and good from the Lord with those in the church of the reformed who are in its externals, and are in that faith, and are called the laity. By “pouring out his vial” is signified the influx of truth and good from the Lord, as above (n. 676–677); by “the sea” is signified the external of the church, thus those who are in its externals, when “the earth” signifies the internal of the church, thus those who are in its internals (n. 398, 403–404, 420, 470, 677); these are they who are called the laity, and are in that faith. 681. And it became blood as of one dead, and every living soul died in the sea signifies infernal falsity with them, by which every truth of the Word, and thence of the church, and of faith, is extinguished. By “blood as of one dead,” or by gore and matter, is signified infernal falsity; for by “blood” is signified the Divine truth, and in the opposite sense, the same falsified (n. 379); but by “blood as of one dead,” is signified infernal falsity, for by “death” is signified the extinction of spiritual life, and thence by “dead” is signified what is infernal (n. 321, 525). By “every living soul died,” is signified that every truth of the Word, of the church, and of faith was extinguished, for by “living soul” is signified the truth of faith, and by “the living soul died” is signified the extinction of the truth of faith. By “soul” in the Word, when spoken of man, is signified his spiritual life, which also is the life of his understanding, and as the understanding is the understanding from truths, and truths are of faith, therefore by “soul” is signified the truth of faith.

That by “soul and heart” is meant the life of man is evident, but his life is from the will and the understanding, or spiritually speaking, from love and wisdom, then from charity and faith; and the life of the will from the good of love, or of charity, is meant by “the heart,” and the life of the understanding from the truths of wisdom or of faith, is meant by “the soul.” This is what is meant by “soul and heart” in Matt. 22:37; Mark 12:30, 33; Luke 10:27; Deut. 6:5; 10:12; 11:13; 26:16; Jer. 32:41, and in other places. It is the same in those passages where “the heart” is mentioned by itself, and “the soul” by itself. That the reason of their being named is from the correspondence of the heart with the will and love, and of the respiration of the lungs with the understanding and wisdom, may be seen in Divine Love and Wisdom, chapter 5, where that correspondence is treated of. 683.1 Verse 4. And the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters signifies influx into their understanding of the Word. By “the third angel pouring out his vial,” in like manner as by the former, is signified influx from the Lord from truths and goods, here into the understanding of the Word with them; for by “rivers” are signified truths in abundance, serving the rational man, thus the understanding, for doctrine and life (n. 409); and by “a fountain of waters” is signified the Lord as to the Word, thus the Word of the Lord, and therefore by “fountains of waters” are signified Divine truths thence (n. 384, 409). 684.

That by “blood,” in the good sense, is signified the Divine truth, and in the opposite sense, the Divine truth falsified, see above (n. 379). The reason why Divine truth falsified and profaned is signified by “blood” is because the Jews shed the Lord’s blood, who was the Divine truth itself, or the Word, and this they did because they had falsified and profaned all the truths of the Word.

Verse 5. And I heard the angel of the waters saying signifies the Divine truth of the Word. By “the angel of the waters” nothing else is signified but the Divine truth of the Word, because “waters” signify truths (n. 50), and “an angel” signifies what is Divine from the Lord (n. 415, 631, 633), and also truth from him (n. 170). 686. Thou art just, O Lord, who art, and who wast, and art holy, because thou hast judged these things signifies that this is of the Divine providence of the Lord, who is and who was the Word, and the Divine truth itself, which otherwise would be profaned. “Thou art just, O Lord, because thou hast judged these things” signifies that this is of the Lord’s Divine providence, as will be seen presently. “Who art, and who wast” signifies the Lord as to the Word, that he is and was the Word, according to John 1:1–2, 14. The reason why the Lord is here meant by the Word is because it now treats of the understanding of the Word with those who are of the church. What is further signified by “is and was,” “the beginning and the end,” “the first and the last,” “the alpha and the omega,” when applied to the Lord, may be seen above (n. 13, 29–31, 38, 57). By “holy” is signified that he is the Divine truth itself (n. 173, 586, 666). From these things it is evident that by “thou art just, O Lord, who art, and who wast, and art holy, because thou hast judged these things” is signified that this is of the Divine providence of the Lord, who is and was the Word and Divine truth itself. [2] The reason why it is of the Lord’s Divine providence that they who are in faith alone should falsify the truths of the Word, is because if they knew them so as to think of them interiorly, they would profane them; for they are in evils, because they do not shun evils as sins, nor approach the Lord immediately.

It is therefore one of the laws of permission, which are also laws of the Divine providence, that they should from themselves falsify truths, and this in proportion as they are in evils of life. That it is of the Divine providence, that they who are in evils of life should never be otherwise than in falsities of doctrine, lest the Divine truths of the Word should be profaned, may be seen in Divine Providence (n. 221–233, and 257 at the end). 687. Verse 6. Because they have poured out the blood of saints and prophets signifies this by reason that the single tenet that faith alone saves without the works of the law, when received, perverts all true doctrinals from the Word. By “pouring out blood” is signified here, as above (n. 684), to falsify the truths of the Word, thus to pervert them. By “saints” are signified they who are in truths in the church, thus also abstractly, the truths of the church (n. 586). By “prophets” are signified they who are in doctrinals from the Word, thus also abstractly doctrinals from the Word (n. 133). 688. And thou hast given them blood to drink, for they are worthy signifies that they who have confirmed themselves in faith alone both in doctrine and in life have been permitted from the Divine providence of the Lord to falsify the truths of the Word, and to imbue their lives with such falsifications. By “drinking blood” is signified not only to falsify the truths of the Word, but also to imbue their life with such falsifications; for he who drinks appropriates to himself and imbues. It is said, “because they are worthy,” by reason that they who receive faith alone, and live according to it, are in evils as to life, and evil operates that in them; and of those who are in evils, it is here said, that “they are worthy,” as it is said in the world of those who are punished for evil doing.

Now, since the Divine good of the Word and the Divine truth of the Word make one, therefore the signification of what was spoken by the angel of the waters is similar to that which was spoken by the angel out of the altar; for the angel of the waters said, “thou art just, O Lord, who art, and who wast, and art holy, because thou hast judged these things”; but the angel out of the altar said, “Yea, Lord God almighty; true and just are thy judgments.” Both these expressions have a similar signification, but with this difference, that one spoke from truth, and the other from good, and one confirmed what the other spoke, but by different words; one by words which belong to the class of truth, and the other by words which belong to the class of good; for there is a marriage of truth and good in every particular of the Word (n. 97), and there are words which relate to good, and words which relate to truth, which seem different, but nevertheless involve things which are similar. 690. Verse 8. And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun signifies influx into their love. By “pouring out his vial” is signified here, as before, influx from goods and truths, here into their love; for by “the sun” is signified the Divine love of the Lord, and, in the opposite sense, self-love (n. 53, 382, 414), here self-love, because it follows that men were scorched with fire and burned with great heat, by which are signified the lusts of that love. 691. And it was given unto him to scorch men with fire signifies that love to the Lord tormented them, because they were in the lusts of evils from the delight of the loves of them. Since by “pouring out his vial” is signified influx from the Lord from goods and truths, therefore by “pouring his vial upon the sun” is signified influx from the Lord from the Divine love, in order to disclose the quality of the love with the men of that church.

That “heat” signifies lusts for evils and thence for falsities may be seen above (n. 382); and that “fire” signifies the Divine love, and in the opposite sense, infernal love (n. 494). That self-love is infernal love, and that its delight is infernal delight, and that the delight of that love exists from and consists of innumerable lusts of evils is shown in many places in Divine Providence, and also in Divine Love and Wisdom. That this is the case is not known in the Christian world, because it is not known what love to the Lord is, and this love will teach the nature of self-love. 692. Verse 9. And men were scorched with great heat and they blasphemed the name of God, who hath authority over these plagues signifies that by reason of the delight of self-love originating in grievous lusts of evils, they did not acknowledge the divinity of the Lord’s human, from which nevertheless flows all the good of love and the truth of faith. By “heat” the lust of evils are signified, which are contained in self-love and its delight (n. 382, 691), therefore by “burning with great heat,” is signified to be in grievous lust, and so in the delight of love. By “blaspheming the name of God” is signified to deny or not to acknowledge the divinity of the Lord’s human, nor the sanctity of the Word (n. 517, 582). “To blaspheme” is to deny or not to acknowledge, and “the name of God” is the Lord’s Divine human, and at the same time the Word (n. 584). By “having authority over the plagues” is signified that from him flows every good of love and truth of faith, by which evils and falsities are removed (n. 673, 680, 690), and because the seven angels having the seven plagues went out from the tabernacle of the testimony (Rev. 15:5, 6), and by “the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony” is signified the inmost of heaven, where the Lord is in his holiness in the Word and in the Law, which is the Decalogue (n. 669), and thence was the influx, which is signified by “pouring"

[2] The nature of self-love shall be explained in a few words; the delight of it exceeds every delight in the world, for it is composed of mere lusts of evils, and each lust breathes out its delight. Every man is born into this delight, and as it compels the mind of man to think constantly of himself, it withholds it from thinking of God and of the neighbor, except from himself and concerning himself. Wherefore if God does not favor his lusts, he is angry with God, just as he is angry with the neighbor who does not favor them. This delight, when it increases, renders man unable to think above self, but under self, for it immerses his mind in the proprium of his body; thence the man becomes successively sensual, and a sensual man speaks in a high and lofty tone about worldly and civil affairs, but of God and Divine things he can only speak from the memory. If he is a person engaged in civil affairs, he acknowledges nature as the creator, and his own prudence as the governor, and he denies a God. If he is a priest, he speaks of God and of Divine things from the memory, yet in a high and lofty tone, but in his heart he has little belief in them. 693. And they repented not to give him glory signifies that therefore they cannot receive with any faith, that the Lord is the God of heaven and earth even as to the human, although the Word teaches it. “Not to repent” signifies not to depart from evils, but to abide in them; and “not giving him glory” signifies not to receive in faith that the Lord is the God of heaven and earth, for this is to give him the glory. That the Lord is the God of heaven and earth he himself teaches openly in Matt. 28:18; John 16:3; 17:2, 3; as also that the Father and he are one, John 10:30; 12:45; 14:6–11; 16:15, and in other places; and moreover, the doctrine of the church teaches, that the Divine and the human are one person, united like soul and body. 694.

That “a throne” is also mentioned in relation to the government of evil and falsity, appears from the following passages: The dragon gave the beast his power and his throne, and great authority (Rev. 13:2). I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, where Satan’s throne is (Rev. 2:13). I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the ancient of days did sit (Dan. 7:9).And I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms, and the strength of the kingdoms of the nations (Hag. 2:22).Lucifer hath said, I will exalt my throne above the stars (Isa. 14:13, and in other places). 695. And his kingdom became dark signifies that nothing but falsities appeared. By “darkness” falsities are signified, because “light” signifies truth; that “darkness” signifies falsities, by which are evils, and “thick darkness,” falsities from evils, see above (n.413). Therefore by “the kingdom of the beast became dark” issignified that nothing but falsities appeared.

That they are not in any truths (n. 489, 501, 653), but in mere falsities (n. 563, 597, 602). But thefalsities of their faith do not indeed appear before themselves as darkness, that is, as falsities, but they appear to them as if they were lucid, that is, as truths, after they have confirmed them; but nevertheless while they are viewed from the light of heaven, which discloses all things, they appear as darkness.

The reason why they do not appear to themselves to be in darkness but in light, although they are in falsities, is because their falsities, after confirmation, appear to them as truths, hence comes their light; but it is the light of infatuation, such as is the light of the confirmation of what is false. This light corresponds to that to which owls and bats owe their sight, to which darkness is light and light darkness, yea, to which the sun itself is thick darkness. Such eyes do they have after death, who in the world confirmed themselves in falsities to such a degree as to see falsity as truth and truth as falsity. 696. And they gnawed their tongues for distress signifies that they could not endure truths. By distress is not meant distress from falsities, for these do not give them any distress, but distress from truths is meant, thus that they could not endure them. By “gnawing2 their tongues” is signified that they would not hear truths, “the tongue” signifying the confession of truth, because the tongue serves the thought for speech, and spiritually for confession; “to gnaw the tongue” signifies to detain the thought from hearing truths. That this is the signification of “gnawing the tongue” cannot be confirmed from the Word, by reason that the expression does not occur anywhere else, but it has been granted me to know this from experience in the spiritual world, where, if anyone speaks the truths of faith, those spirits who cannot bear to hear truths keep their tongues between their teeth, and also bite their lips, and induce others likewise to press their tongues and lips with their teeth, and this to such a degree as to produce distress. From these considerations it is evident, that by “gnawing their tongues for distress,” is signified that they could not endure truths. That the tongue, as the organ of speech signifies thought and confession, and also the doctrine of truth, see above (n. 282). 697. Verse 11.

Distress is predicated of falsities; by “sores” are signified interior evils, as above (n. 678); and as interior evils and falsities spring from the acknowledgment and reception of the dogma concerning faith alone, therefore this also is signified. 698. And they repented not of their works signifies that although instructed from the Word, still they would not recede from the falsities of faith and the evils of life thence. “Not to repent” signifies not to recede from, as above (n. 693), and by “works” are here signified the falsities of faith, and evils of life thence, as above (n. 641). According to the sense of the letter, neither distresses nor sores could compel them to repent of their falsities and evils, but it is according to the spiritual sense, that instruction from the Word could not drive them from their falsities and evils, because these are infernal. Hence it appears that by “they repented not of their works” is signified that although instructed from the Word, yet they would not recede from their falsities of faith and the evils of life thence. It is said that “works” here signify the falsities of faith and evils of life thence; and it is so said because falsity of faith precedes, and the evil of life follows. For it is a falsity of faith that evil does not condemn him who is in faith, thence man lives securely not thinking about any evil, and thus never repents, or does the work of repentance; in like manner, if he persuades himself that works contribute nothing to salvation, but faith alone without them. 699.

They of the present church who are in faith alone are meant by “the dragon,” “the beast” and “the false prophet,” of which mention is made below.

Verse 13. And I saw out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet signifies the perception that from the theology founded on the doctrine of a trinity of persons in the divinity, and on the doctrine of justification by faith alone without the works of the law. By “the mouth” is signified doctrine, and thence preaching and discourse (n. 453, 574). By “the dragon” is signified the acknowledgment of three gods, and of justification by faith alone, and thence the devastation of the church (n. 537). By “the beast out of the sea,” which is here meant, the men of the external church are signified, who are in that acknowledgment and faith (n. 567, 576, 577, 601). By “the false prophet” are signified the men of the internal church, who teach theology from those doctrines; the false prophet is not mentioned before, but “the beast out of the earth” which is now so called, see above (n. 594). Now as all these things are signified by “the dragon,” “the beast out of the sea,” and “the false prophet,” which here is “the beast out of the earth,” it follows that by “I saw out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet” is signified a perception that is from the theology founded on the doctrine of the trinity of persons in the divinity, and on the doctrine of justification by faith alone without the works of the law. 702.

By “spirits” the same is here signified as by demons, because it is presently said that they were “spirits of demons,” and by “demons,” are signified the lusts of falsifying truths (n. 458). By “three” are signified all (n. 400, 505), here therefore mere; by “frogs” are signified reasonings from lusts, because they croak, and have itching desires; hence it is plain, that by “the three unclean spirits like frogs,” are signified mere"

The reason why frogs were produced from the waters of Egypt and remained in the river was because the waters in Egypt, and especially the waters of its rivers signified the falsities of doctrine from which they reasoned. 703. Verse 14. For they are the spirits of demons signifies that they were cupidities of falsifying truths, and of reasoning from falsities. That by “demons” are signified the cupidities of falsifying truths, see above (n. 458), and as they were “like frogs,” they were also the cupidities of reasoning from falsities, as above (n. 702). 704.

That “to do signs” is to testify and also to make attestation that a thing is true, see above (n. 598–599), here that their falsities are truths. By “the kings of the earth and of the whole world,” are signified they who are principally in falsities from evil, here all who are in the same falsities in the whole church; for by “kings” are signified they who are in truths from good, and, in the opposite sense, they who are in falsities from evil (n. 483). By “the earth” is signified the church (n. 285); in like manner, by “the world” (n. 551). By “going away to gather them together to battle” is signified to incite them to combat or to attack; for by “war” is signified spiritual war, which is of falsity against truth, and of truth against falsity (n. 500, 586)."

It is said that “the spirits of demons” would do this, because they signify the cupidities of falsifying truths, and of reasonings from falsities, as above (n. 703). From these things it is evident, that by “spirits of demons doing signs to go away unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them together to the battle of that great day of God almighty” are signified attestations by those who are meant by “the dragon,” “the beast,” and “the false prophet,” as above (n. 701–702), that their falsities are truths, and the stirring up of all those in the whole church, who are in the same falsities, to attack the truths of the new church.

In that day shall the nations seek the root of Jesse, and his rest shall be glory (Isa. 11:10).In that day shall the eyes have respect unto the holy one of Israel (Isa. 17:7, 9).In that day shall they say, Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him, that he should save us (Isa. 25:9).My people shall know my name, and in that day they shall know that I am he that doth speak, behold, it is I (Isa. 52:6). Alas, the great day of Jehovah, and there shall not be like it (Jer. 30:7).

In that day there shall be upon the bells of the horses, Holiness to Jehovah (Zech. 14:1, 4, 6–9, 13, 20–21). Besides these places there are many more, in which the Lord’s coming and the new church from him at that time are meant by “the day of Jehovah”; as in these: Isa. 4:2; 19:16, 18, 21, 24; 20:6; 22:20; 25:9; 28:5; 29:18; 30:25–26; 31:7; Jer. 3:16–18; 23:5–7, 12, 20; 50:4, 20, 27; Ezek. 24:26, 27; 29:21; 34:11–12; 36:33; Hos. 3:5; 6:1, 2; Joel 2:29; 3:1, 14, 18; Obad. 15; Amos 9:11, 13; Micah. 4:6; Hab. 3:2; Zeph. 3:11, 16, 19, 20; Zech. 2:11; Ps. 72:7, 8. And that day is called “the day of Jehovah” (Joel 1:15; 2:1–2, 11; Amos 5:13, 18, 20; Zeph. 1:7, 14; 2:2–3; Zech. 14:1 and elsewhere).

That “to come as a thief,” when said of the Lord signifies his advent, and then those will have heaven who have lived well, and those who have lived wickedly will have hell, see above, (n. 164). That he is called “happy” who receives eternal life (n. 639). “To watch” signifies to live spiritually, that is, to be in truths and in a life according to them, and to look to the Lord (n. 158); and “to keep his garments” signifies to remain therein even to the end of life; for “garments” signify investing truths (n. 166, 212, 328), thus the Lord’s commandments in the Word, for these are truths. Now these things follow in their order from what precedes; for what precedes relates to the Lord’s advent, and to the new church; as also to the opposition it will meet with from those who are of the old church; and inasmuch as combat is at hand, they who are in truths from the Word are admonished to remain in them, lest they succumb in battle, spoken of in the next verse. 706. Lest he walk naked and they see his shame signifies lest they should be with those who are in no truths, and their infernal loves should appear. “To walk naked” signifies to live without truths. “The shame of nakedness,” or the secret parts signifies unclean loves, which are infernal loves; and inasmuch as it is said, “lest they see his shame,” it signifies lest they should appear. That by “nakedness” is signified ignorance of truth, and by “shame of nakedness” infernal love, see above (n. 213). These things are said for those who will be of the Lord’s new church, that they may learn truths and remain in them, for without truths their connate evils, which are infernal loves, cannot be removed. A man may, indeed, live like a Christian without truths, but this only before men, but not before angels. The truths which they should learn relate to the Lord, and to the commandments according to which they should live. 707. Verse 16.

That it is from the purpose of destroying the new church is because combat between the old church and the new is meant, and the purpose of the combat is to destroy. What is signified by “Armageddon” will be told below. It has been said before that: The dragon went away to make war with the rest of the seed of the woman, that keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ (Rev. 12:17); It was given to the beast out of the sea to make war with the saints (Rev. 13:7). The spirits of demons that went out of the mouth of the dragon, of the beast, and of the false prophet, went away to the kings of the earth, to gather them together to the war of that great day of God almighty (Rev. 16:13–14). Here the battle itself is now treated of, the success of which is not described, but only its state, which is signified by “Armageddon.” [2] By “Armageddon” is signified in heaven the love of honor, of dominion, and of supereminence; and also in the Hebrew language by Aram or Arom loftiness is signified, and love from loftiness is by “Megiddo” in the ancient Hebrew language, as is manifest from its signification in the Arabic language. The same is signified by “Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddo” in Zechariah 12:11. In that chapter the coming of the Lord is also treated of, and the end of the Jewish church at that time, and the beginning of a new church to be established by the Lord, and also the collision betweenthose churches; on which account the expression “in that day” so often occurs in that chapter; and by “that day” is signified the coming of the Lord, as above (n. 704). That it may be seen, I will adduce the passages: In that day I will make Jerusalem a stone of burden unto all peoples. In that day I will smite every horse with astonishment and his rider with madness. In that day I will make the leaders of Judah like a furnace of fire in wood.

That the church will then be in doctrine concerning the Lord (Zech. 12:8). That he will destroy all and all things that are contrary to that doctrine (Zech. 12:9); And that then there will be a new church from the Lord (Zech. 12:10).

These are the contents of the three chapters, 12–14 of Zechariah, in the spiritual sense, disclosed because in them also the last state of the old church and the first state of the new church are treated of. And as it is said that “they are to be gathered together into a place called in Hebrew Armageddon,” it is evident that the same things were said in this prophet concerning the last state of the church of this day and the first state of the new church. By “Armageddon” is signified, as was said, the love of honor, of dominion, and of supereminence; for from that is the combat, and from that and on account of it is lamentation which is described there (Zech. 12:11–14).

That by “voices,” “lightings,” and “thunders” are signified reasonings, falsifications of truths, and arguments from falsities, may be evident from what is said above (n. 396, 530), and from similar things there. That they who are in faith separate from the works of the law, and thence in evils of life, refuse to reflect upon the evils in themselves, because they do not wish to recede from them if they know them, is manifest without explanation. Experience teaches this; for evils are delights because they are loves and no one wishes to recede from delights unless he looks to the life after death, and first to hell to see what it is, and afterwards to heaven, what that is, and thinks of them aside from any evil act. If he then looks to the Lord also, and thinks, “What is the temporal in comparison with the eternal? Is it not as nothing?” He can then reflect upon his evils, and wish to know them, and to recede from them. But if he had confirmed himself in faith alone, he will then say in his heart, Our theological faith, that God the Father has mercy for the sake of the son who suffered for our sins, if I supplicate this with some confidence, it effects all things; he then does not reflect upon any evil in himself; he also says with himself from that faith, that evil does not condemn, and that salvation is pure mercy, besides other similar"

That by “an earthquake” changes in the state of the church are signified, may be seen above (n. 331): and as earthquakes are lighter and more severe, here the most severe, because it is said that such an earthquake had not occurred since men were made, it is manifest that by “the earthquake” here are signified the shakings, convulsions, and overturnings of all things in the church, and the drawing of them down from heaven.

By “falling,” which is said of the cities of the nations, is also signified to be destroyed. It is said that “the city was divided into three parts,” and that “the cities of the nations fell,” because an earthquake was mentioned just before, in which such effects have place. By “the great city” is meant th e great city spoken of above (chap. 11:8), which is there called “Sodom and Egypt,” as may be seen above (n. 501–504). The reason why “a city” signifies doctrine, and thence “cities” signify doctrinals, is because by “land,” and particularly by “the land of Canaan,” is signified the church; and since the church is a church from doctrine and according to it, therefore by “cities” are signified doctrinals. These were also taught in cities, because in them were synagogues, and in Jerusalem was the temple; hence it is that by Jerusalem is signified the church as to doctrine in a universal sense. 713.

The reason why it is said “of the weight of a talent” is because a talent was the largest weight of silver and also of gold; and by “silver” is signified truth, and by “gold” good, and in the opposite sense falsity and evil (n. 211). Its being said that “the hail cometh down from heaven upon men” is according to the appearances from which and from correspondences is the literal sense of the Word. This is similar to what was said before of “the plagues,” that “they were poured out from heaven upon men by angels” when yet they are truths and goods sent down by the Lord, which among those who are below are turned into falsities and evils (n. 673). In the spiritual world also, among those who are engaged in reasonings from falsities against the truths of the Word, hail sometimes appears to come down, and upon others sulphur and fire, and because these appear in the atmosphere above them, and come as it were from heaven, therefore from that appearance it is said that such hail came down from heaven. 715. And men blasphemed God because of the plague of hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great signifies that because they had confirmed themselves in such falsities, they have denied truths to that degree as not to be able to acknowledge them, by reason of the repugnances arising from their interior falsities and evils. “To blaspheme” God signifies to deny and not to acknowledge the Lord alone to be the God of heaven and earth (n. 571, 582, 697) and in like manner the truth of the Word; “for the plague thereof was exceeding great” signifies by reason of those direful and atrocious falsities from the confirmed dogma of justification by faith alone (n. 714). The reason why they cannot acknowledge truths on account of those falsities is because the confirmation of falsity is the denial of truth. It appears as if it was meant that “the plague of hail” was so great that from torment or pain they blasphemed God when it fell upon them; but this is not meant, but that they could not acknowledge truths on account of falsities; in like manner as"

To the above I will add this relation. In the spiritual world I spoke with some English bishops concerning the small works published there at London in the year 1758, which were Heaven and Hell, New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine, Last Judgment, White Horse, and Earths in the Universe; which small works were sent as a gift to all the bishops, and to many of the nobles or lords. They said that they received them, and saw them, but did not think them worthy, although skillfully written; and likewise that they persuaded as many as they could not to read them. I asked, “Why so, when yet there are there arcana concerning heaven and hell, and concerning the life after death, and more things most worthy of attention, which have been revealed by the Lord for those who will be of his new church, which is the new Jerusalem?” But they said, “What is this to us?” and they poured out vituperations against them as formerly in the world. I heard them. And then these things were read before them from Revelation: And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates, and the water of it was dried up, that the way of the kings from the rising of the sun might be prepared; and I saw out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet three unclean spirits like frogs; for they are spirits of demons doing signs to go away unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them together unto the battle of that great day of God almighty; and he gathered them together unto the place called in Hebrew Armageddon (Rev. 16:12–16). This was explained before them; and it was said that they, and similar persons elsewhere, were meant by these things. [2] The king, grandfather4 to the king now reigning, heard from heaven these things which were said to the bishops; and being somewhat indignant said, “What is this?” And then a certain one of them, who had not made one with them in the world, turned to"

For they believe in God the Father, and not in his son, although they know from the Lord, that it is the will of the Father, that they should believe in the son; and that they who believe in the son should have eternal life; and that they who do not believe in the son, will not see life. Besides this, they cast out charity, which is done by the Lord through man as by him, from the smallest part in salvation.” [3] Speaking further with the king, he exposed the hierarchy which many of them continually affect and also exercise, which they strengthen by conjunction and combination with all of their order, by means of emissaries, internuncios, letters, and conversations, upheld by ecclesiastical and at the same time political authority; from which they almost all hold together like one bundle. And it is also effected by that hierarchy, that the above-named works for the new Jerusalem, though published at London, and sent to them as a gift, have been so shamefully rejected, that they have not even been held worthy to be named among the books of their catalogue. On hearing this the king was astonished, especially at their thinking so of the Lord, who yet is the God of heaven and earth, and of charity, which yet is religion itself. And then the interiors of their mind and faith were laid open by light let in from heaven; and the king saw, and then said, “Depart; alas, who can grow so callous against hearing anything concerning heaven and eternal life?” [4] The king then inquired whence so universal an obedience was paid to them by the clergy; and it was said that it was from the authority conceded to every bishop in his diocese, of nominating to the king only one candidate to the churches, and not three, as in other kingdoms. Also that from that power they had the influence to advance their dependents to higher honors and larger incomes, each one according to the obedience which he manifests.

What goes before, from chapter 7 to chapter 16, inclusive, treats of the reformed; this chapter and the next treat of the Papists, among whom they who have claimed to themselves the power of opening and shutting heaven are meant by “Babylon.” Here therefore it shall first be said what is specifically meant by “Babylon.” By “Babylon” or “Babel” is meant the love of dominion over the holy things of the church from self-love, and because that love ascends in proportion as the reins are relaxed to it, and as the holy things of the church are also the holy things of heaven, therefore by “Babylon” or “Babel” is also signified dominion over heaven. And because this love thus acts the part of the devil, because it aspires to the same things, it cannot do otherwise than profane things holy, by adulterating the goods and truths of the Word, therefore by “Babylon” or “Babel” is also signified the profanation of what is holy, and the adulteration of the good and truth of the Word.

Thou shalt declare this parable concerning the king of Babel: thy magnificence is brought down into hell; thou hast fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, thou hast said in thy heart, I will ascend the heavens, above the stars of God I will exalt my throne, I will ascend above the heights of the cloud, I will become like the most high; but yet thou shalt be brought down to hell; I will rise against thee,3 and will cut off from Babel the name and residue (Isa. 14:4, 11–15, 22). Besides more things in the whole chapter. Jehovah hath spoken against Babel: Your mother was exceedingly ashamed, she that brought you forth was suffused with shame; behold, the last end shall be a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert. Set yourselves in array against Babel round about, shoot against her, spare no arrows; how is Babel become a desolation among the nations! She acted insolently against Jehovah, against the holy one of Israel. A drought is upon her waters, that they may dry up, because it is a land of graven images, and it glories in horrible things; therefore the ziim shall dwell there with the ijim, and the owls shall dwell therein, as God’s overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah (Jer. 50:1, 12, 14, 23, 29, 31, 38–40).

Similar things are signified by the following passages in Daniel: By the statue seen by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel, the feet of which were partly iron and partly clay, which the stone cut out not by a hand smote and ground to pieces, and all the parts of the statue became as the chaff in the threshing floors; and the stone became a great rock (Dan. 2:31–47)."

From these things it is evident, that by “saying unto me, I will show unto thee the judgment of the great harlot that sitteth upon many waters,” is signified revelation concerning that religious persuasion, as to its profanations and adulterations of the truths of the Word.

But read them with attention, and you will see that they applied all those things taken from the Word to obtaining dominion over the souls of men, and to acquiring to themselves Divine power, authority, and majesty.

That by “kings” are signified those who are in truths from good from the Lord, and thence abstractly the truths from good, may be seen above (n. 20, 664); here those truths adulterated and profaned. It is said that “the kings of the earth” committed whoredom with the great harlot, as though the truths of the church which are from the Word, which are signified by “the kings of the earth,” had so done; but this is according to the style of the Word in the sense of the letter, in which are ascribed to God and to the Divine things which are from him, such as are the truths of the Word, the things which come nevertheless from man and his evils, as has been frequently observed above.

And hast made us unto our God kings and priests; and we shall reign over the earth (Rev. 5:10). That ye may eat the flesh of kings, the flesh of captains, the flesh of horses and of them that sit on them (Rev. 19:18). The seven heads of the scarlet beast are seven mountains. And they are seven kings; five have fallen, and one is; and the beast is the eighth king, and is of the seven (Rev. 17:9–11). The ten horns are ten kings, who have not yet received a kingdom (Rev. 17:12). It is also said as here, that: The kings of the earth committed whoredom, and lived luxuriously with the harlot (Rev. 18:3, 9).

[4] By “the king of the south” is signified the kingdom or church of those who are in truths, and by “the king of the north” is signified the kingdom and church of those who are in falsities; for it is a prophecy concerning the churches to come, showing their quality in the beginning, and afterwards. The reason why they who are in truths from good from the Lord are called “kings,” is because they are called “the sons” of the Lord; and because they are regenerated by him, they are called “born from him,” and also “heirs”; and because the Lord is himself a king, and heaven and the church are his kingdom. 721.

By “being made drunk with the wine of whoredom” is signified to be insane in spiritual things from the falsification of the truths of the Word, here from their adulteration; by “wine” the Divine truth of the Word is signified (n. 316), and by “whoredom” is signified its falsification and adulteration (n. 134, 620, 632, 635). Therefore by “being made drunk with that wine” is signified to be insane in spiritual things; by “the inhabitants of the earth” are signified they who are in the church, as above (chap. 11:10; 12:12; 13:13–14; 14:6); but here, they who are in that religious persuasion since the church is not there, because they do not approach the Lord, nor read the Word, and because they invoke the dead, see above (n. 718). “To be made drunk with that wine” signifies to be insane in spiritual things, may"

And he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness signifies that he was carried in a spiritual state to those with whom all things of the church were devastated. By “a wilderness” is signified a church in which there is no longer any truth, and thus where all the things of it are devastated (n. 546); and by being “in the spirit” is signified to be in a spiritual state from the Divine influx, as shown above (n. 36); hence by “he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness,” is signified to be carried in a spiritual state to those with whom all things of the church were devastated. 723.

By “the scarlet beast” is signified the Word, as will be seen presently; and by “full of names of blasphemy,” is signified that it was totally profaned; for by “blasphemy” is signified the denial of the Lord’s Divine in his human, and the adulteration of the Word (n. 571, 582, 692, 715), thus profanation. For he who does not acknowledge the Lord’s Divine in his human, and falsifies the Word, though not intentionally, indeed profanes, but lightly; they who ascribe to themselves all the power of the Lord’s Divine human, and therefore deny it, and they who apply all things of the Word to acquiring to themselves dominion over the holy things of the church and heaven, and for that reason adulterate the Word, these profane grievously. From these things it may appear, that by “I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet beast, full of names of blasphemy,” is signified that religious persuasion founded upon the Word profaned by them. By “scarlet” is signified the truth of the Word from a celestial origin."

That “the four animals,” one of which was a lion, another a calf, and the fourth an eagle, signify the Word, and are also called “beasts” in Ezekiel (n. 239, 275, 286, 672). That “a horse,” which is also a beast signifies the understanding of the Word (n. 298). That “a lamb” signifies the Lord, “a sheep” the man of the church, and “a flock” the church itself, is known. These are quoted, lestanyone should wonder that “the scarlet beast” signifies the Word. And because the Roman Catholic religious persuasion rests its strength and dignity upon the Word, therefore that woman appeared “sitting upon a scarlet beast,” as she had before appeared “upon many waters” (verse 1), by which are signified the truths ofthe Word adulterated and profaned, as above (n. 719). That by that “beast” is signified the Word, appears manifestly from the things said of it in the following passages of this chapter, as: The beast that thou sawest, was, and is not; and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder on seeing the beast that was, and is not, and yet is (Rev. 17:8). The beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth king, and is of the seven, and goeth into perdition (Rev. 17:11). The ten horns are ten kings, who shall give their power and authority to the beast (Rev.17:12–13). God hath given it in their hearts to give their kingdom to the beast (Rev. 17:17).

That “seven” does not signify seven, but all, and is applied to holy things (n. 10, 391). That “a horn” signifies power (n. 270), and that “ten horns” signify much power (n. 539); that by “seven heads” is signified intelligence at first holy, and afterwards none, and at length insanity, appears from verses 9 and 10 of this chapter where the angel mentions the signification of “seven heads,” as will be seen below. Hence it is plain that by “the beast having seven heads and ten horns” is signified intelligence from the Word, at first holy, afterwards none, and at length insanity, and much power from the Word continually. 725. Verse 4. And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet signifies celestial Divine good and Divine truth, which are of the Word with them. By “purple” is signified celestial Divine good, and by “scarlet” is signified celestial Divine truth, as will be seen presently; by “being clothed” with them is signified to have them about them, consequently with them. The reason why these principles are with them from the Word is because by “the scarlet beast” upon which the woman sat is signified the Word (n. 723). That the Divine good and truth of the Word is about them as a garment, thus with them, is known, for they adore the Word from without and not from within; they acknowledge it, because it treats of the Lord, and of his power over heaven and the church, which they have transferred to themselves; and it treats of the keys given to Peter, whose successors they say they are. And since upon these two they found their majesty, dignity, and authority, they of necessity acknowledge the holiness of the Word. But yet the Word to them is only like the garment of “purple and scarlet and of gold, precious stones and pearls,” upon a harlot holding in her hand a golden cup, full of abominations and uncleanness of whoredom. [2] Since “purple and scarlet” are mentioned, and then “gold, precious stones, and pearls,” and by “purple and scarlet” is signified celestial Divine good and truth, and by “gold and precious stones” spiritual Divine good and truth, both from the Word, therefore something shall be said concerning the celestial Divine and the"

There are two kingdoms into which the whole heaven of the Lord is distinguished, the celestial kingdom and the spiritual kingdom; the celestial kingdom consists of angels who are in love from the Lord, and the spiritual kingdom of angels who are in wisdom from the Lord. In both kingdoms there is good and truth; the good and truth with the angels of the celestial kingdom is signified by “purple and scarlet,” and the good and truth with the angels of the spiritual kingdom is signified by “gold and precious stones.” Both these goods and truths the angels have from the Lord through the Word; wherefore there are two interior senses of the Word, the celestial and the spiritual. This then is the reason why “the woman sitting upon the scarlet beast appeared arrayed in purple and scarlet, and inwrought with gold and precious stones, and pearls.” [3] The same which is signified by this woman is also signified by: The rich man, who was clothed in purple and fine linen, and indulged splendidly in delicacies every day, at whose gateway Lazarus was cast, desiring to be filled with the crumbs that fell from his table (Luke 16:19–21). By “the rich man clothed in purple and fine linen” the Jews are meant, who had the Word; and by “Lazarus” are meant the gentiles, who had it not. Similar things are signified in the following passages: They that have eaten delicacies are devastated in the streets; they that were brought up in scarlet have embraced the dunghill (Lam. 4:5). Therefore, thou wasted one, what wilt thou do? Though thou clothest thyself in scarlet, though thou adornest thyself with an ornament of gold, in vain shalt thou make thyself beautiful (Jer. 4:30). Daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet with delightful things, and who put an ornament of gold upon your apparel (2 Sam. 1:24).

It is manifest from these passages what is signified by “the purple and scarlet” with which the woman that sat upon the scarlet beast appeared arrayed. In like manner in the following passages, where it is said: Alas, the great city, which was clothed in fine linen and purple and scarlet, inwrought with gold and precious stone and pearls; for in one hour so great riches are devastated (Rev. 18:16–17). Also that purple and scarlet, gold, precious stone, and pearls, were among the merchandise of Babylon, see Rev. 18:12. 726. And inwrought with gold and precious stone signifies spiritual Divine good and Divine truth, which are of the Word, with them. By “gold” is signified good (n. 211); by “precious stone” is signified truth (n. 231, 540, 570); both from the Word. That spiritual good and truth are signified is because celestial good and truth are signified by “purple and scarlet”; and both are conjoined in the Word on account of the marriage of good and truth therein (n. 373); and celestial good and truth, because they are of love, are in their essence good; and spiritual good and truth, because they are of wisdom, are in their essence truth. That celestial good and truth are of love, and that spiritual good and truth are of wisdom, may be seen above (n. 725). What is meant besides by this woman’s being thus arrayed and adorned may be seen in the preceding article."

By this is signified knowledge concerning the Lord. The twelve gates of the wall of the new Jerusalem were twelve pearls, every one of the gates was one pearl (Rev. 21:21). “The gates of the new Jerusalem” signify introduction into the new church, and introduction is effected by the knowledges of good and truth from the Word.

Therefore by “having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and uncleanness of her whoredom,” is signified that religious persuasion consisting of the holy things of the church profaned and defiled, and of the goods and truths of the Word profaned, by direful falsities. These things are similar to what the Lord said to the scribes and Pharisees: Woe unto you hypocrites, for ye make yourselves like unto whited sepulchers, which indeed appear beautiful on the outside, but within are full of the bones of the dead, and of all uncleanness (Matt. 23:27). 729.

Now because these words were written on her forehead, and by “written on the forehead” is signified to be implanted in the love, and their love is the love of dominating from the love of self, over all things of the church and over heaven, thus over all things of the Lord and his Word, therefore this is signified."

That it is the love of dominating over all things of the church, is known from the authority claimed over the souls of men and over all things relating to their worship.

By “the beast which was and is not, but yet is,” is signified that the Word, so rejected, still is. It is manifest from this, that by “they that dwell upon the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, seeing the beast which was and is not, but yet is,” is signified the amazement of those who are of that religious persuasion all who since its establishment have aspired at domination over heaven and earth, that the Word, though it has been thus rejected, still is. For all who aspire at domination over the holy things of the church and over heaven, hate the Word, because they hate the Lord; if not in the mouth, still in the heart. That it is so, few know in the world, because they are then in the body; but it is made manifest after death, when everyone is in his spirit. Hence it is that they wonder that the Word still is, though it has been so rejected; as was said above (n. 734). The reason that the Word still is, is because it is Divine, and the Lord is in it. 736. Verse 9.

That the interpretation is in the natural sense for those who are in the spiritual sense, is because the interpretation was made by the angel in the natural sense, and not in the spiritual; for he said that the seven heads of the beast were “seven mountains,” and likewise that “they were seven kings”; and that “one of them is, and another is not yet come”; also that the beast “is the eighth, and is of the seven”; besides more things which follow even to the end of the chapter; and these things cannot be understood except by those who are in the spiritual sense from the Lord; this is therefore signified by “having wisdom.” The reason that the interpretation was made by the angel in the natural sense, and not in the spiritual, is because the natural sense is the basis, the container and the support of its spiritual and celestial sense; see Doctrine of the Sacred Scripture (n. 27–49). Therefore also elsewhere in the Word interpretations are given in the natural sense; and still they cannot be understood interiorly except by the spiritual sense; as may be seen in the prophets, and also in the evangelists, in many places. 737.

The reason is that the whole Word is profaned and adulterated by that religious persuasion, see above (n. 717, 719–721, 723, 728–730). [2] It is said to have been profaned in time, since in the beginning the Word was holy to them; but as they saw that they could dominate by the holy things of the church, they receded from the Word, and acknowledged their own edicts, precepts, and statutes as of equal, but really of superior holiness; and at length they transferred all the Lord’s authority to themselves, not leaving anything. It is from their first state, when they held the Word holy, that Lucifer, by whom is meant Babel (n. 717), was called “son of the morning”; but it is on account of their later state, that “he was let down into hell” (Isa. 14:5). But more may be seen on this subject in Divine Providence (n. 257). It may seem as if by “the seven mountains where the woman sitteth” is meant Rome; because that is built upon seven mountains, from which also it is named. But although Rome is meant, since the throne and tribunal of that religious persuasion is there, nevertheless by “the seven mountains” the Divine goods of the Word, and thence of the church, profaned, are here signified; for the number seven adds nothing else but what is holy, here what is profaned, as the same number does elsewhere; as where are mentioned: Seven spirits before the throne of God (Rev. 1:4). Seven candlesticks, in the midst of which was the son of man (Rev. 1:13; 2:1). Seven stars (Rev. 2:1; 3:1). Seven lamps of fire before the throne (Rev. 4:5). Seven seals, with which the book was sealed (Rev. 5:1). Seven horns and seven eyes of the lamb (Rev. 6:6). Seven angels with seven trumpets (Rev. 8:2)."

Five have fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet come; and when he is come, he must remain a short time signifies that all the Divine truths of the Word have been destroyed, except this one, that all authority in heaven and in earth was given to the Lord; and except another, which has not yet come into question; and when it does, it will not remain; which is, that the Lord’s human is Divine. By “five” is not signified five, but all the rest; here all the rest of the Divine truths of the Word, which are signified by “kings.” For numbers in Revelation, and in the Word generally, signify the quality of the things with which they are connected. They are like certain adjectives united with substantives, or like certain predicates adjoined to subjects; as may be seen from the numbers two, three, four, six, seven, ten, twelve, a hundred and forty-four, explained above. Here therefore “five” signifies all the rest, because “seven” signifies all the holy things of the Word; and it follows that “one is,” and that “the other is to come”; and thus that there are two out of them all which remained. From which it is manifest, that by “five have fallen” is signified that all the rest have been destroyed. They are said “to fall,” because kings are spoken of, who fall by the sword. By “one is” nothing else is signified but this Divine truth, that all power in heaven and on earth was given to the Lord according to the words of the Lord himself (Matt. 28:18; John 13:3; 17:2–3, 10), as may be seen above (n. 618). That this one has not been destroyed is because otherwise they could not claim to themselves dominion over all things of the church and the Word and over heaven. [2] By “the other who is not yet come, and when he cometh must remain but a short time,” is signified the Divine truth which has not yet come in question, and when it does, will not remain with them, which is, that the Lord’s human is Divine.

That it is a Divine truth that the Lord’s human is Divine, may be seen in Doctrine of the Lord, from beginning to end. But the reason that it has not yet come in question is because, after they had transferred to themselves all the Lord’s power, they could not acknowledge the Lord’s human as Divine, because it would then be said by the laity and the common people that they had transferred Divine power to themselves, and thus that the pontiff himself was God, and his ministers were gods. But that this will yet come in question, may be evident from the fact that it is here foretold in Revelation. [3] That they have seen this other truth, which is that the Lord’s human is Divine, though as with closed eyes, is manifest from these things with them, that they say in the Eucharist there is not only the body and blood of the Lord, but also his soul and divinity; thus that there is omnipresence as well of his human as of his Divine; and the human cannot be omnipresent unless it is Divine; also that they say, that Christ as to his body and blood, and at the same time as to his soul and divinity is in them, and they are in him by the Eucharist; and this is said of his human; which cannot be said, because it is not possible, unless his human is Divine. Besides these things they also say that the saints will reign with Christ, and that Christ is to be adored, and that the saints are to be invoked and venerated; also that Christ is the true light, and that in him they live and have merit, and other similar things, which involve the divinity of his human. These things are from the Council of Trent and from its bull. Thus, as was said, they may see that truth, but as if with closed eyes. 739. Verse 11. And the beast which was and is not is himself the eighth, and is of the seven, and he goeth into perdition signifies that the Word, as explained above, is the Divine good itself, and that it is the Divine truth, and that it is taken away from the laity and the common people, lest the profanations and adulterations made in it by their leaders should appear, and they should on that account"

By “the beast which was and is not” is signified the Word, as before (verse 8); by “his being himself the eighth,” here the eighth mountain, is signified that it is the Divine good itself; for by “the seven mountains” the Divine goods of the Word are signified (n. 737); hence by “the beast himself is the eighth” mountain is signified that it is the Divine good itself. Good is also signified by “the eighth”; and as all the goods of the Word among them were profaned, he himself is not said to be of the seven mountains, as he is just said to be of the seven kings, by whom the Divine truths of the Word are signified, not all of which were adulterated (n. 737–738). From these few things the arcanum may be seen which lies hidden in these words. By “his going into perdition” is signified that it is rejected, as above (n. 734); but because the Word is not so rejected but that it is acknowledged as holy, but is taken away from the laity and the common people lest the profanations of good and the adulterations of truth made in it by their leaders should appear, and the laity should on that account withdraw, therefore this, because it is the cause itself, is signified by “going into perdition.” That the Word is the Divine good itself and the Divine truth is because there is in each and every thing of it the marriage of the Lord and the church, and thence the marriage of good and truth; also because there is in every thing of it a celestial sense and a spiritual sense; and in the celestial sense it is the Divine good, and in the spiritual sense it is the Divine truth; and these are in the Word, because the Lord is the Word; which things are all demonstrated in Doctrine of the Sacred Scripture, published at Amsterdam. 740.

The rest, who indeed profess that religion, but still dissent in various things, are treated of in verse 15, and the Protestants, or reformed, who have openly receded from that religion (verses 16–17). [2] But it can by no means be known that all these are here treated of, unless it is known that the Word is meant by “the scarlet beast,” and that the church is according to the reception of the Word. That by the “scarlet beast” is meant the Word, may be seen above (n. 723); and that the church is a church from the Word and according to its understanding, see Doctrine of the Sacred Scripture (n. 76–79). By “horns,” here the horns of the beast, the power of the Word is signified; and by “ten horns” much power, here Divine power, because it is that of the Lord through the Word. That “horns” signify power, and “ten horns” much power, may be seen above (n. 270, 539, 724). That by “kings” are signified those who are in Divine truths from the Word, and abstractly the Divine truths therein (n. 90, 664, 704); and that by “ten” is not meant ten but many and many things (n. 101).

But they receive authority as kings one hour with the beast signifies that the Word has power with them, and they by the Word, as if they were in its Divine truths. By “receiving authority with the beast” is signified to have power together with the Word, and thus that the Word has power with them, and they by means of the Word. By “receiving authority” is signified to be strong, and by “the beast” the Word is signified (n. 723); by “as kings” is signified as if they were in Divine truths from the Word. That by “kings” are signified those who are in Divine truths from the Word, and abstractly the Divine truths therein (n. 20, 664, 704, 740); by “one hour” is signified for some time, and also in some degree. From these things it is manifest that by “their receiving power as kings one hour with the beast” is signified that the Word has power with them, and they through the Word, as if they were in its Divine truths. These things are said because they acknowledge that the Word is divinely inspired, and hence that the church is a church from the Word. But still they do not as yet draw Divine truths from it, except these general ones: that God alone is to be worshiped, and not any man like God; and that the authority given to Peter is not in itself Divine, and yet that it is Divine to open and shut heaven, which is not in any man’s own power. These things they confirm in themselves from the Word; but before others, who do not hear the Word, they do it from rationality, which is given by continual influx out of heaven to everyone who wishes to be in truths.

By “having one mind” is signified to acknowledge unanimously; by “giving power and authority to the beast” is signified to ascribe government and dominion over the church to the Word. The reason that government and dominion over the church are meant, is because the Word, and therefore the church, is treated of. From these things it is manifest, that by “these have one mind, and give their power and authority to the beast,” is signified that they unanimously acknowledge that government and dominion over the church are solely through the Word. They indeed acknowledge the pontiff as the head of the church; but they say that his government and dominion over the church is not like that of the head over the body, but is like one supreme over the body that does not rule and govern from itself, but from God through the Word; and that it is then to be obeyed.

It is said that these waters “are peoples, multitudes, nations, and tongues,” because by these are signified all those who are under the papal dominion, of its varieties of doctrine and discipline and religion and confession; for by “peoples” are signified they who are in doctrine (n. 483); by “multitudes” those who are in discipline, by “nations” those that are in religion (n. 483); and by “tongues” those who are in confession (n. 282, 483).

And shall make her desolate and naked signifies that they will put off from themselves her falsities and evils.

That “to burn up with fire” has this meaning is because the punishment of the profanation of what is holy was burning; wherefore it was of the Divine law that: They who profaned the name of Jehovah by worshiping other gods should themselves and all that they had be burned up with fire (Deut. 13:12–18).

Nor is anything else signified by “the fire and pile in Tophet,” but the fire of hell, which is for those who profane holy things (Isa. 30:33; Jer. 7:11, 31–32; 19:5–6; 2 Kings 23:10); for there they worshiped Moloch by a heinous sacrifice. [2] Since by “the fourth beast” in Daniel 7 the religious persuasion which profanes the Word and thence the holy things of the church is signified (n. 717), it is therefore said that “it was burnt up with fire” (Dan. 7:11). Now as it is profane worship to worship a man in place of the Lord, it is therefore said here, that “they should burn up the harlot herself with fire,” by which is signified that they should hold as accursed the religious persuasion itself, and destroy it with themselves. The reason that “by eating her flesh” is signified to condemn from hatred and to destroy with themselves the evils and falsities which are proper to that religious persuasion is because that is signified by “eating flesh”; for by “flesh” are signified the things proper to anyone, which have relation to goods and truths, and in the opposite sense to evils and"

That by “flesh” is signified what is proper to anyone, which in itself is evil, is evident from these passages: It is the spirit that quickeneth, the flesh profiteth nothing (John 6:63). That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is generated of the spirit is spirit (John 3:6). As many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, who were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh (John 1:12–13). God remembered that they were flesh, a breath that passeth away and returneth not (Ps. 78:39). Egypt is man, and not God; and its horses are flesh, and not spirit (Isa. 31:3). Jerusalem hath committed whoredom with the sons of Egypt great in flesh (Ezek. 16:26). Jesus said to Peter, Flesh and blood hath not revealed these things to thee (Matt. 16:17). Cursed is he that trusteth in man and maketh flesh his arm (Jer. 17:5). [3] Because “flesh” signifies man’s proprium, and they who hate another assail the things that are his own with the purpose of destroying them, this therefore is signified by “eating flesh,” as also in these passages: He that dieth let him die, and he that is cut off let him be cut off, let the rest eat each one the flesh of another (Zech. 11:9). They shall eat up Israel with every mouth; they shall eat every man the flesh of his arm, Manasseh Ephraim, and Ephraim Manasseh (Isa. 9:12, 20–21). I will feed thy oppressors with their own flesh (Isa. 49:26). They shall eat everyone the flesh of his companion (Jer. 19:9)."

Besides, in the Word “all flesh” is spoken of; and by it is signified every man (Gen. 6:12, 13, 17, 19; Isa. 40:5, 6; 49:26; 66:16, 23, 24; Jer. 25:31; 32:27; 45:5; Ezek. 20:48, 49). 749. Verse 17.

Since the Roman Catholic religious persuasion is signified by “the harlot,” and the Protestants are signified by “the ten horns that shall hate the harlot,” as above (n. 746–748); it is manifest that by “doing his mind” is signified that they have judged and concluded that they should altogether repudiate that religious persuasion and hold it accursed, and should destroy and root it out with themselves, as above (n. 748). And it is also manifest that by “doing one mind and giving the kingdom to the beast” is signified to judge and conclude unanimously that they should acknowledge the Word, and found the church upon it. By “the beast” is signified the Word, as everywhere above (see n. 723); and by “kingdom” the church is signified, and the government over it, as is shown just below. By “God gave into their hearts” is signified that they are from the Lord. [2] That “kingdom” signifies the church may be evident from these passages: The sons of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness (Matt. 8:12). The seed is the sons of the kingdom (Matt. 13:38). He that heareth the Word of the kingdom, and attendeth not (Matt. 13:19)."

Until the words of God shall be consummated signifies until all the things which have been foretold concerning them shall be fulfilled. By “being consummated” is signified to be fulfilled; and by “the words of God” are signified the things which are foretold in the Word; and because it is said “to be consummated” it signifies until they all are fulfilled. This is said of the Protestants, and of “their giving the kingdom to the beast”; that is, that they will acknowledge the Word, and found the church upon it, as just above (n. 749). But they do indeed acknowledge the Word, and say that the church is founded upon it; and still they found the doctrine of their church upon a single saying of Paul, that “man is justified by faith alone without the works of the law” (Rom. 3:28), altogether falsely understood (n. 417). Because it is here said, “until the words of God are consummated,” it shall also be told what is signified by the Lord’s last words to the disciples, which are these: Go ye and make disciples of all nations, teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you; and behold, I am with you all the days, even until the consummation of the age. Amen (Matt. 28:19–20). “Until the consummation of the age” is until the end of the church (n. 658); and then, if they do not go to the Lord himself, and live according to his commandments, they are left by the Lord; and being left by the Lord they become like pagans, who have no religion; and then the Lord is with those only, who will be of his new church. These things are signified by “until the words of God are consummated,” and by “even until the consummation of the age.” 751. Verse 18.

But how shall be told. She does not have a kingdom over the Protestants, as she has over those who are attached to her religious persuasion; but only so far as they have in some part received her doctrinals. The doctrinals which they have received are these: that they approach God the Father, and not the Lord; that they do not acknowledge the Lord’s human as Divine; that his passion of the cross is expiation, propitiation, and satisfaction to God the Father; concerning the imputation of the Lord’s merit; some things concerning baptism, concerning original sin, and concerning free will; and with the Lutherans, that they accede nearly to transubstantiation. These doctrinals, the residue from papal Catholicism, and agreeing with it in part, are the things from which it is said, that “the woman,” who is “the great city,” “hath a kingdom over the kings of the earth.” By “the woman” the Roman Catholic religious persuasion is signified, as above; by “the city” is signified doctrine (n. 194, 501, 502, 712); by “kingdom” the church is signified (n. 749); hence by “having a kingdom” is signified government; by “the kings of the earth” are signified the truths or falsities of the church (n. 20, 483, 664, 704, 720, 737, 704); hence also doctrinals; by “the earth” is signified the church (n. 285). From these things it is evident that by these words, “the woman whom thou sawest is the great city which hath a kingdom over the kings of the earth,” is signified that the Roman Catholic religious persuasion reigns as to doctrine in the Christian world, and as to some part even with the reformed, although they are not under the papal dominion. 752. To this I will add this relation. It was granted me to speak with Pope Sextus Quintus. He came out of a certain society in the west to the left.

He wondered when I related that it was decreed in a synod, and confirmed by a bull, that they should be invoked. He said that he led an active life as he had done in the world; and that he proposed to himself every morning nine or ten things, which he wished should be accomplished before evening. I asked whence he obtained in so few years so great a treasure as he had laid up in the castle of Angelo. He replied that he wrote with his own hand to the rulers of the rich monasteries, to send him at their discretion from their resources as much as they were willing, as it was for a holy use; and that they sent abundantly, because they feared him. And when I said that that treasure was still remaining, he said, “For what use is it now?” [2] While speaking with him, I related that since his time the treasure in Loretto had been immensely increased and enriched, and in like manner the treasures in certain monasteries, especially in Spain; but not to so great a degree at this day as in former ages. And I added that they keep them without any end of use, other than to enjoy themselves from their possession. And when I related this, I said also that they are thus like the infernal gods, which the ancients called Plutos. When I mentioned Plutos, he replied, “Be silent, I know.” He said again, that no others are admitted into the society over which he presided, but those who excel in judgment, and can receive the belief that the Lord alone is the God of heaven and earth, and that the Word is the holy Divine; and that under the Lord’s auspices he is every day perfecting that society. And he said that he has spoken with the saints so called; but that they become foolish, when they hear and believe that they are saints.

Verse 21. “And one strong angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that great city, Babylon, be cast down, and shall not be found anymore” signifies that by a strong influx of the Lord out of heaven, that religious persuasion with all its adulterated truths of the Word, will be cast headlong into hell, and will not appear to the angels anymore (n. 791). Verse 22. “And the voice of harpers and musicians and pipers and trumpeters shall not be heard in thee anymore” signifies that there will not be with them any affection of spiritual truth and good nor any affection of celestial good and truth (n. 792). “And no craftsman of any craft shall be found anymore in thee” signifies that they who are in that religious persuasion from doctrine and from a life according to it"

By “an angel” the Lord is signified; by “an angel coming down out of heaven” is signified the Lord’s influx out of heaven; by “having great authority,” is signified strong influx; by “the earth was lightened by his glory” is signified the church in heavenly light from the Lord by Divine truth. That by “an angel” and by “angels” in the Word the Lord is meant, may be seen (n. 258, 344, 465, 649, 657, 718). By “coming down” is signified to flow in, because it is said of the Lord. That the church is signified by “the earth” (n. 285, 721). That glory is said of the Divine truth, and signifies it (n. 249, 629). It is said, Divine truth in heavenly light, because the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord is the light of heaven, which enlightens the angels, and makes their wisdom.

But demons, like lusts, are of many kinds; but the worst are those who are lusts of having dominion over the holy things of the church and over heaven from the heat of the love of self.

Wherefore they who have immersed themselves in those delights and pleasures cannot come to the delights and pleasures of the affections of the love of good and truth any otherwise than as those who urge the oars against the current of the swift river with the strong power of the arms.

For what is from the Lord is Divine,which can never become man’s own. The Divine can be with a man, but not in his proprium, for man’s proprium is nothing but evil; wherefore he who attributes to himself what is Divine as his own not only defiles it but also profanes it.

And because the church as to the knowledges of truth and good is signified by “Tyre,” therefore it treats of her traffic and gain in the whole of chapter 27 of Ezekiel; and it is said of her: In thy wisdom and in thy intelligence thou hast made for thyself gold and silver in thy treasures, and by the multitude of wisdom in thy traffic hast thou multiplied for thyself wealth (Ezek. 28:4–5)."

This is similar to what is said frequently in the Word, that God will bring retribution and vengeance for injustices and injuries done to himself, and from anger and wrath will destroy them; when yet the evils themselves which they have committed against God do this; thus they do it to themselves; for this is the law of retaliation, which draws its very origin from this Divine law: All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them; for this is the law and the prophets (Matt. 7:12; Luke 6:31).

Return to the stronghold, ye prisoners of hope; this day I announce, I will recompense unto thee double (Zech. 9:12). For your shame ye shall have double, and in their land they shall possess the double, everlasting joy shall be unto them (Isa. 61:7). 763. Verse 7. As much as she hath glorified herself, and lived luxuriously, so much torment and mourning give her signifies that in the degree of their elation of heart from dominion, and according to their exultation of mind and body from riches, they have after death internal grief from being cast down and derided, and from want and misery. By “as much as she hath glorified herself” is signified in the degree according to their elation of heart from dominion; for they glorify themselves from this. By “as much as she hath lived luxuriously,” is signified in the degree of their exultation of mind and body on account of riches, and the delights and pleasures therefrom, as above (n. 759). By “giving her torment,” is signified internal grief at being cast down from dominion, and then derision; their torment after death is from no other source; and by “giving her mourning” is signified internal grief from want and misery; their mourning after death is from these."

For the delights and pleasantnesses proceeding from the loves make the life of everyone; wherefore when these are turned into the opposites, there arise torment and mourning. These are the retributions and punishments which are meant in the Word by the torments in hell; and thence hatred against the Lord and against all things of heaven and the church, is meant by “the fire” there. Similar things are said of Babel in the prophets, as: I will render unto Babel all the evil which they have done in Zion before your eyes (Jer. 51:24). The waster shall come upon Babel, for the God of retributions, Jehovah, recompensing will recompense (Jer. 51:55–56). Thy magnificence is brought down into hell; the worm is spread under thee (torment which is internal grief); thou hast said in thy heart, I will ascend the heavens, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God, I will become like the most high; nevertheless thou shalt be brought down to hell; they that see thee shall say, Is this the man that shook the earth, that made the kingdoms tremble? etc. (Isa. 14:11, 13–16). This is said of Lucifer, who there is Babel, as is manifest from Isa. 14:4, 22. 764. For she saith in her heart, I sit a queen, and am not a widow, and shall not see mourning signifies that they have these things, because from elation of heart on account of dominion and exultation of mind on account of riches, they are in the trust and confidence that they will have dominion perpetually and will protect themselves; and that they can never be deprived of these things. “To say in their heart” signifies to be in assurance from elation of heart over dominion, also to be in confidence from exultation of mind over riches. “I sit a queen” signifies that they"

By “a widow” is signified one who is without protection, because without a man. It is said, “a queen” and “a widow,” and not “king” and “man,” because Babylon as a church is meant. “And I shall not see mourning” signifies that they can never be deprived of those two things. That they have mourning therefrom after death, may be seen just above (n. 763). [2] Very similar things are said of Babel in Isaiah: Thou shalt no more call thyself the mistress of kingdoms; thou hast said in thy heart, I shall be mistress forever, saying in thy heart, I am, and there is none else like me; I shall not sit a widow, nor shall I know bereavement; but these two things shall come unto thee in one day, bereavement and widowhood. They shall come upon thee for the multitude of thy sorceries, and the greatness of thy many enchantments. Thou hast trusted in wickedness; thou hast said, None seeth me; thy wisdom hath seduced thee, when thou hast said in thine heart, I am, and there is none else like me; therefore devastation shall come upon thee suddenly (Isa. 47:5, 7, 8–11). By “a widow” in the Word is meant one who is without protection, for by “a widow” in the spiritual sense is signified one who is in good and not in truth. For by “a man” is signified truth, and by “his wife,” good; hence by “a widow,” good without truth is signified, and good without truth is without protection; for truth protects good. This is signified by widow when mentioned in the Word (as Isa. 9:14–15, 17; 10:1–2; Jer. 22:3; 49:10–11; Lam. 5:2–3; Ezek. 22:6–7; Mal. 3:5; Ps. 68:5; 146:7–9; Exod. 22:21–24; Deut. 10:18; 27:19; Matt. 23:14; Luke 4:24; 20:47). 765.

By “in one day” the time of the last judgment is signified, which is also called the day of judgment. By “plagues” are signified the punishments of the evils which they did in the world, which will then return upon them. By “death” is signified infernal life and inward grief from being cast down from dominion, which is called torment above (n. 763); concerning which death something will be said presently. By “mourning” is signified internal grief from want and misery in place of opulence, as also above (n. 764). By “famine” the deprivation of the understanding of all truth is signified. Into these three plagues or punishments those of that religious persuasion come, who have had dominion from the love of self, and with no love of uses except for the sake of self. These are also atheists in heart, since they attribute all things to their own prudence and to nature. The rest from that nation, who are such, but do not think interiorly in themselves, are idolaters. It may be seen above (n. 323), that the deprivation of the understanding of all truth is meant by the plague or punishment which is called “famine.” Every man indeed, as long as he lives in the world, has rationality, that is, the faculty of understanding truth. This faculty remains with every man after death. Still they who have imbued falsities of religion in the world from the love of self and the pride of their own intelligence, after death are not willing to understand truth; and not to be willing is as it were not to be able. This inability from unwillingness is with all such, and is increased from this, that from the delight of the lust of falsity for the sake of dominion they continually imbue new confirming falsities, and thus become as to the understanding mere falsities, and remain so to eternity. Similar things are meant by these words concerning Babel in Jeremiah: Your mother is greatly ashamed, she that bare you is suffused with shame; behold, the end shall be a wilderness, dryness, and a desert; from the anger of Jehovah it shall not be inhabited, but shall be a total devastation; everyone that passeth by Babylon shall be astonished, and shall hiss over all her plagues (Jer. 50:12, 13)."

By “fire” with which she will be burnt up is signified hatred against the Lord and against his heaven and church, of which see below. By “for strong is the Lord that judgeth her” is signified that they see then, that is, in the spiritual world into which they come after death, that the Lord alone has dominion and reigns over all things in the heavens and on earth, and not at all any man from himself. This is signified by “strong is the Lord God that judgeth her,” because the Lord does not judge anyone to hell, but they themselves; for when they feel the angelic sphere concerning the Lord flowing down out of heaven, they flee away and cast themselves into hell, as may be evident from the things that were shown above (n. 233, 325, 339–340, 387, 502). [2] That by “fire” is signified love in both senses, celestial love which is love to the Lord, and infernal love which is the love of self, may be seen above (n. 468, 494). That infernal fire is hatred, is because the love of self hates; for all who are in that love burn with anger according to the degree of it, and are inflamed with hatred and revenge against those who oppose; and they who are of Babylon, against those that deny that they are to be worshiped and adored as sanctities. When, therefore, they hear that the Lord alone is worshiped and adored in heaven, and that to worship any man in place of the Lord is profane, adoration of the Lord becomes in them hatred against him, and the adulteration of the Word to the end that they may be worshiped becomes profane. This, therefore, is what is signified by “Babylon shall be burned up with fire.” It may be seen above (n. 748), that “being burned up with fire” is the punishment of the profanation of what is holy. The like is meant by these words in Jeremiah: I am against thee, O Babel, the destroying mountain, that destroyest the whole earth; I will roll thee down from the rocks, and will give thee for a mountain of burning. The walls of Babel are utterly overturned, and her high gates are burned up with fire (Jer. 51:25, 58)."

In this and the following verse the mourning “of the kings of the earth” is treated of, by whom the highest in the order are meant, who are called magnates and primates; from verses 11–16, the mourning of “the merchants of the earth” is treated of, by whom are meant the lower ones in the order, who are called monks; and from verses 17–19, the mourning of “the shipmasters and sailors” is treated of, by whom those are meant that contribute, who are called the laity. Here “the kings of the earth” are now treated of, by whom the highest in the order are signified. That by “kings” are not meant kings, but those who are in truths from good, and in the opposite sense, in falsities from evil, may be seen above (n. 483, 704, 720, 737, 740). Here, therefore, by “the kings of the earth” who committed whoredom and lived luxuriously with the harlot, are signified those who are in dominion and its delights through the truths of the Word falsified and adulterated, especially through that truth falsified and adulterated by them, which the Lord said to Peter; respecting which something follows. That “to commit whoredom” signifies to falsify and adulterate the truths of the Word, may be seen (n. 134, 632, 635); and that to live luxuriously signifies to enjoy the delights of dominion and at the same time of opulence (n. 759). By their “weeping and wailing,” their interior griefs are signified. It is said “to weep and wail over” because to weep over is from grief at being cast down from dominion, and to wail over is from grief at the deprivation of opulence. And because the griefs of these are more interior than those of the “merchants of the earth,” it is therefore said of “the kings of the earth,” by whom are meant the higher ones in the order, that “they weep and wail over,” and of “the merchants of the earth,” by whom the lower ones of the order are meant, it is said that “they wept and mourned.” By “seeing the smoke of her burning” is signified when they see the falsities of their religious persuasion, which are the falsified and adulterated truths of the"

Something shall here be said concerning that truth which the Lord said to Peter respecting the keys of the kingdom of the heavens, and respecting the authority to bind and loose (Matt. 16:15–20). They say that that authority was given to Peter, and that it has been transferred to them as his successors; and that the Lord thus left to Peter, and after him to them, all his authority; and that he should act as his vicar on earth. But still it is plainly manifest from the Lord’s words themselves, that he did not give the least of authority to Peter; for the Lord says, “Upon this rock I will build my church.” By a “rock” the Lord is signified as to his Divine truth; and the Divine truth which is the rock, is there what Peter confessed, before the Lord said those words; which is this: Jesus said to the disciples, But who say ye that I am? Simon Peter answering said, Thou art the Christ, the son of the living God (Matt. 16:15–16). This is the truth upon which the Lord builds his church, and Peter then represented that truth. From which it is manifest, that the confession of the Lord, that he is the son of the living God, who has power over heaven and earth (Matt. 28:18), is that upon which the Lord builds his church; and thus upon himself, and not upon Peter. It is known in the church that the Lord is meant by a rock.

But to the inquiry, whether they knew that in everything in the Word there is a spiritual sense, which is the sense of the Word in heaven, they said at first that they did not know it; but afterwards they said they would inquire. And when they inquired, they were instructed that there is a spiritual sense in each thing of the Word, which differs from the sense of the letter as spiritual from natural; and they were further instructed that no person named in the Word is named in heaven, but that instead something spiritual is there understood. They were informed at length, that for “Peter” in the Word the truth of the church from good is meant, and the same by the rock, which is mentioned together with Peter; and that it may thereby be known, that not any authority was given to Peter, but to truth from good; for all authority in the heavens belongs to truth from good, or is of good by truth. And as all good and all truth are from the Lord, and nothing from man, that all authority belongs to the Lord. On hearing this, being indignant, they said that they wished to know whether there is that spiritual sense in those words. Whereupon the Word which is in heaven was given to them, in which Word there is not the natural sense, but the spiritual; because it is for the angels, who are spiritual. And when they read it, they saw manifestly that Peter was not mentioned there, but instead of him “Truth from good which is from the Lord.” On seeing this, they rejected it from anger, and would almost have torn it in pieces with their teeth, unless at that moment it had been taken away from them. They were thence convinced, although they were not willing to be convinced, that to the Lord alone that authority belongs, and not in the least to any man, because it is a Divine authority. 769.

That “woe” signifies lamentation over calamity, unhappiness, and condemnation, may be seen above (n. 416); hence “woe, woe” signifies grievous lamentation. By “the great city Babylon” that religious persuasion is signified; here as above (n. 751), Babylon as a woman or harlot, because “her torment” is spoken of. By “mighty city” is signified the religious persuasion so fortified. By “in one hour is thy judgment come” is signified that it could be so suddenly overturned, and that they could perish. “In one hour” signifies so suddenly; and by “judgment” is signified its overthrow and the destruction of those who committed whoredom and lived luxuriously with the harlot, who are here treated of. That they perished by the last judgment may be seen in the small work Last Judgment and Babylon Destroyed, published at London, 1758. These things are said respecting that destruction. [2] The reason that “they stood afar off for fear of her torment” signifies a state as yet remote from the state of those who are in condemnation, because in fear of the torment, is because by “afar off” is not meant remoteness of space, but remoteness of state, when one is in fear of punishments; for as long as a man is in a state of fear, he sees, weighs, and laments. Remoteness of state, which is remoteness in the spiritual sense, is also signified by “afar off” elsewhere in the Word, as in these passages: Hear, ye that are afar off, what I will do; and ye that are near, know my might (Isa. 33:13). Am I God that is near, and not a God afar off? (Jer. 23:23). He found grace in the wilderness, Israel said, Jehovah hath appeared unto me from afar (Jer. 31:2–3). Bring my sons from afar (Isa. 43:6).

In common speech also relatives are said to be near, and those more remote in relationship are said to be distant. 770. That religious persuasion is called “a mighty city,” because it had fortified itself strongly; for it had fortified itself not only by the multitude of the nations and peoples who acknowledge it, but by many other things also; as by a great number of monasteries, and by the armies of monks there (this is said, because they call the ministry their military service); by possessions of wealth without any measure or satiety; also by the tribunal of the inquisition; besides by threats and terrors, especially of purgatory, into which everyone is said to come; by the extinction of the light of the gospel, and thence blindness in spiritual things, which is effected by prohibitions and inhibitions of the reading of the Word; by masses spoken in a language unknown to the common people; by various external sanctities; by impressing the worship of the dead and of images upon the common people, who are kept in ignorance concerning God; and by various splendid things in externals; that by these things they may be in a corporeal faith concerning the sanctity of all the things in that religious persuasion.

That it is natural good, is because wood is not a costly material, like gold, silver, precious stone, pearl, fine linen, purple, silk and scarlet, stone likewise. It is the same with ivory, by which natural truth is signified. “Ivory” signifies natural truth, because it is white, and can be polished, and because it protrudes from the mouth of an elephant, and likewise makes his strength. That “ivory” may be the natural truth of that good which is signified by “thyine wood,” it is said “a vessel of ivory”; for by “a vessel” that which contains is signified; here truth the container of good. [4] That “wood” signifies good may be in some degree evident from these passages:"

These are similar to the things explained above (n. 772–774); with the difference, that by these the scientifics which are the ultimates of man’s natural mind are meant, which, as they differ in quality from the essence that is in them, are called vessels of precious wood, of brass, of iron and of marble. For by “vessels” are signified scientifics here in matters of the church; because scientifics are the containers of good and truth, as vessels are the containers of oil and wine. Scientifics are also in great variety, and their receptacle is the memory. That they are of great variety is because man’s interiors are in them; they are also introduced into the memory either from intellectual thought, or from hearing, or from reading, and then according to the various perception from the rational. All these are within scientifics; which appears when they are reproduced, which happens when the man speaks or thinks. [2] But what is signified by “vessels of precious wood, of brass, of iron, and of marble,” shall be briefly told. By “a vessel of precious wood” is signified knowledge from rational good and truth; by “a vessel of brass” knowledge from natural good is signified; by “a vessel of iron,” knowledge from natural truth is signified; and by “a vessel of marble” is signified knowledge from the appearance of good and truth. That “wood” signifies good may be seen just above (n. 774). That good and at the same time rational truth are here signified by “precious wood,” is because “wood” signifies good, and “precious” is predicated of truth; for one kind of good is signified by the wood of the olive tree, another by that of the cedar, the fig, the fir, the poplar, and the oak. That “a vessel of brass and of iron” signifies what is scientific from natural good and truth, is because all the metals, as gold, silver, brass, iron, tin, lead, in the Word signify goods and truths. They signify because they correspond; and because they correspond, they are also in heaven; for all things there are correspondences."

That there appeared to Daniel a man whose feet were as the brightness of polished brass (Dan. 10:5–6).

[2] I have spoken with those who have confirmed themselves in that religious persuasion, also with some who were delegates in the Councils of Nice, of the Lateran, and of Trent, who in the beginning believed that what they had decreed were pure and holy truths, but after instruction and enlightenment then given from heaven, confessed that they did not see one truth; but because they had then confirmed themselves in them more than others, after the enlightenment, which they themselves extinguished, they returned to their former faith. They especially believed that what they had sanctioned concerning baptism and justification were truths. But still, when they were in enlightenment, they saw, and from enlightened sight confessed, that no one has original sin from Adam, but from his own parents successively; and that this is not taken away by the imputation and application of the Lord’s merit in baptism; then that the imputation and application of the Lord’s merit is a human fiction, because impossible; and that faith is never infused into any suckling, because faith is of one who thinks. [3] Still they saw that baptism is holy and a sacrament, because it is a sign and a memorial that man can be regenerated by the Lord through truths from the Word, a sign for heaven, and a memorial for man. Also that by it a man is introduced into the church, as the sons of Israel by the crossing of the Jordan were introduced into the land of Canaan, and as the inhabitants of Jerusalem were prepared for the reception of the Lord by the baptism of John, for without that sign in heaven before the angels, the Jews could not have subsisted and lived at the coming of Jehovah, that is, the Lord, in the flesh. Similar to these were the things which they sanctioned concerning justification. That the imputation of the Lord’s merit neither is nor is given, may be seen in Doctrine of the Lord (n. 18)."

And cinnamon and incense and ointment and frankincense signifies that they no longer have worship from spiritual goods and truths, because they have nothing within their worship which corresponds to the things here named. In the foregoing verse it treats of all the things that are of the doctrine of the church, but in this verse it treats of all the things which are of the worship of the church. The things which are of doctrine are premised, and those that are of worship follow, because the quality of the worship is from the goods and truths of doctrine; for worship is nothing but an external act, in which there should be the internals, which are of doctrine. Without these the worship is without its essence, life and soul. Now because all the things which are of doctrine have relation to the goods which are of love and charity, and to the truths which are of wisdom and faith, and these goods and truths, according to the degrees of their order, are celestial, spiritual, and natural, so also are all the things of worship. And because in the preceding verse the spiritual things of doctrine are mentioned first, so likewise here the spiritual things of worship, which are “cinnamon, incense, ointment, and frankincense”; and the celestial things of worship are named in the second place, which are “wine, oil, fine flour, and wheat”; and the natural things of worship are named in the third place, which are “beasts of burden and sheep.” That all these goods and truths of worship should be from the Word is signified by their being “of horses, of chariots, of the bodies and of the souls of men.” This is the series of the things in the spiritual sense in this verse. But by all those things which are enumerated in this verse, the like is meant as by those that are enumerated in the preceding verse; that is, that these goods and truths are not with them, because they have not with themselves such things as correspond to them.

These are mentioned, because they are such things as incense was made of. That the worship of the Lord from spiritual goods and truths is signified by “incense,” may be seen above (n. 277, 392); and that incense was pleasing, because it was from fragrant things which correspond (n. 394). All the fragrant things by which it was prepared are meant by the cinnamon, incense, and ointment and their essential by the frankincense. This is manifest from the enumeration of the spices of which it was compounded, in Moses: Jehovah said unto Moses, Take to thee spices—stacte, onycha, and galbanum—and pure frankincense; and thou shalt make of them incense, an ointment, the work of a perfumer, salted, pure, holy (Exod. 30:34–37). Of these the incense was made, by which, as was said, worship from spiritual goods and truths was signified. Cinnamon is mentioned here in place of all the spices there. But what each of those spices signifies in the spiritual sense, may be seen in Arcana Coelestia, upon Exodus, where they are severally explained. 778. And wine and oil and fine flour and wheat signifies that they no longer have worship from celestial truths and goods, because they have not within in the worship the things which correspond to the things above mentioned. These things are similar to those which have been said just above and before, with the difference only that celestial goods and truths are here signified. What goods and truths are called celestial, and what spiritual, may be seen above (n. 773); and that as they have not these, neither are they in their worship. For, as was said above, the goods and truths of doctrine are in worship as the soul is in the body; wherefore worship without them is inanimate worship. Such is worship which is holy in externals, in which there is not any holy internal. That “wine” signifies truth from the good of love may be seen above (n. 316)."

By “fine flour” is signified celestial truth, and by “wheat” is signified celestial good. [2] That the truths and goods of worship are signified by “wine,” “oil,” “fine flour” and “wheat” is because the drink offerings and meal offerings consisted of them, which were offered upon the altar together with the sacrifices; and by the sacrifices and by the offerings offered upon the altar worship is signified, for the chief part of worship consisted in them. That the drink offerings, which were wine, were offered upon the altar together with the sacrifices, may be seen (Exod. 29:40; Lev. 23:12, 13, 18–19; Num. 15:2–15; 28:11–15, 18 to end; 29:1–7 seq.; and also in Isa. 57:6; 65:11; Jer. 7:18; 44:17–19; Ezek. 20:28; Joel 1:9; Ps. 16:4; Deut. 32:38). That oil was also offered upon the altar together with the sacrifices (Exod. 29:40; Num. 15:2–15; 28:1 to the end). That the meal offerings, which were of fine flour of wheat, were offered upon the altar together with the sacrifices (Exod. 29:40; Lev. 2:1–13; 5:11–13; 6:14–21; 7:9–13; 23:12–13, 17; Num. 6:14–21; 15:2–15; 18:8–20; 28:1–15; 29:1–7; and besides in Jer. 33:18; Ezek. 16:13–19; Joel 1:9; Mal. 1:10–11; Ps. 141:2). The bread of faces or the showbread upon the table in the tabernacle was also made of fine flour of wheat (Lev. 23:17; 24:5–9). It may be seen from this, that these four things, wine, oil, fine flour and wheat, were holy and celestial things of worship. 779. Since “oil” is here mentioned among the holy things of worship, and signifies celestial good, something shall be said here of “the oil of anointing,” which was in use among the ancients, and was afterwards commanded to the sons of Israel. That in ancient times they anointed stones set up as statues, is manifest from Gen. 28:18–19, 22. That they also anointed warlike arms, shields, and bucklers (2 Sam. 1:21; Isa. 21:5). That it was commanded that they should prepare oil of holiness, with which they should anoint all the holy things of the church; that with it they anointed the altar and all its vessels, also the tabernacle and all things of it (Exod. 30:22–33; 40:9–11; Lev. 8:10–12; Num. 7:1).

[2] Anointing with the oil of holiness was commanded because “oil” signified the good of love, and represented the Lord, who as to his human is the very and the only anointed of Jehovah, anointed not with oil, but with the Divine good itself of the Divine love; wherefore also he was called “the messiah” in the Old Testament and “the Christ” in the New (John 1:41; 4:25); and “messiah” and “Christ” signify anointed. Hence it is that the priests, the kings, and all the things of the church were anointed, and when anointed were called holy; not that they were holy in themselves, but because they thereby represented the Lord as to the Divine human. Hence it was sacrilege to harm a king, because he was “the anointed of Jehovah” (1 Sam. 24:6, 10; 26:9; 2 Sam. 1:16; 19:21). [3] Moreover, it was a received custom to anoint themselves and others to testify gladness and benevolence of mind; but with common oil or some other noble oil, but not with the oil of holiness (Matt. 6:17; Mark 6:13; Luke 7:46; Isa. 61:3; Amos 6:6; Micah 6:15; Ps. 92:10; 104:15; Dan. 10:3; Deut. 28:40). That it was not permitted to anoint themselves or others with the oil of holiness (Exod. 30:32–33). 780. And beasts of burden, and sheep signifies that they no longer have worship from the external or natural goods and truths of the church, because they have not anything within their worship which corresponds to the above mentioned things.

By things “fat and splendid” are signified celestial and spiritual affections of good and truth; by “fat things” the affections of good, as will be seen presently; and by “splendid things” the affections of truth, which are called “splendid,” because they exist from the light of heaven and its splendor in minds; whence are the intelligence of good and truth and wisdom.

But because the love of dominating from the love of self over the holy things of the church and of heaven, all of which are Divine things of the Lord, is diabolical, therefore, after a certain time, they are separated from their companions, and cast down into the hells. But still, because they have from their religious persuasion been in external Divine worship, they are first instructed as to what and of what quality heaven is and what and of what quality the felicity of eternal life is that they are mere beatitudes flowing in from the Lord with everyone in heaven according to the quality of the heavenly affection of good and truth with them. But because they have not approached the Lord, and hence are not conjoined with him, and likewise have not been in any such affection of good and truth, they are averse to them, and turn themselves away, and then desire the pleasures of the love of self and the world, which are merely natural and corporeal. But because it is inherent in those pleasures to do evil, especially to those who worship the Lord, and thus to the angels of heaven, they are therefore deprived of these pleasures also, and are then rejected among companions who are in contempt and misery in infernal workhouses.

There are dispensations in regard to contracting matrimony within the degrees prohibited by the laws; relating to divorces; relating to evils, even enormous ones, and then liberation from temporal punishments; then also by indulgences; dispensations relating to administrations without any power or authority of the secular rulers; among which also are confirmations of dukedoms and principalities; likewise by promises of heavenly joys made to those who enrich monasteries, and augment their treasuries, calling their gifts good works, in themselves holy, as also merits; to which they are led by the belief impressed concerning the power and help of their saints, and in the miracles performed by them. Especially do they plot against the rich when they are sick, and likewise infuse at that time a terror of hell, and so extort from them; promising the sacrifice of the mass for their souls according to the value of their legacy, and a gradual delivery thereby from the"

[2] As regards purgatory, I can aver that it is purely a Babylonish fiction for the sake of gains, and that it neither does nor can exist. Every man after death first comes into the world of spirits, which is midway between heaven and hell, and is there prepared either for heaven or for hell, everyone according to his life in the world; andin that world no one has torment; but the evil first come into torment, when after preparation they come into hell. There are innumerable societies in that world, and joys in them similar to those on earth, for the reason that they who are there are conjoined with men on the earth, who are also in the midst between heaven and hell. Their externals are there successively put off, and thus their internals are opened; and this until the ruling love, which is indeedthe life’s love, and the inmost, and the one that governs their externals, is revealed; and when this is revealed, the man’s realquality appears; and according to the quality of that love, he is sent forth from the world of spirits to his place, if good into heaven, andif evil, into hell. That it is so has been given to me to know of a certainty, because it has been granted to me by the Lord to be together with those who are in that world, and to see all things, and thus to relate it from experience itself; and this now for twenty years. Therefore I can assert that purgatory is a fiction, which maybe called diabolical; because it is for the sake of gains, and for the sake of power over souls, even of the deceased, after death. 785. Verse 16.

By “one hour” is signified suddenly and totally, as above (n. 769); because by time and all the things of time states are signified (n. 476). It is manifest from this, that the things which were adduced above are signified by these words. Very similar things are said of the devastation of Babel in Jeremiah: The land of Babel is full of guilt against the holy one of Israel; the thoughts of Jehovah stand against her, to make her a desolation; they shall not take of thee a stone for a corner nor a stone for foundations, for thou shalt be a waste for an age. Babel shall become heaps, a habitation for dragons, an astonishment and a hissing. Babel is reduced to desolation, the sea goeth up over her, she is covered with the multitude of the waves, her cities are reduced to desolation, a land of drought and of solitude (Jer. 51:5, 26, 29, 37, 41–43). 786.

[2] That all these are here meant, is manifest from the series of things in the spiritual sense; and from the signification of “being upon ships,” and of “being employed upon ships,” and of “sailors”; and from the signification of “them that work at sea.” By the “pilots of ships,” and “those employed upon them,” and “sailors,” no others can be meant but those who contribute the things which are above called merchandise, which are those things which they collect into their treasuries, as also possessions, and who receive benedictions and beatification in return, as merits, and other similar things which they desire for their souls. And when these are meant, it is manifest that by “every pilot” the highest of them are meant; by “everyone employed upon ships,” all in offices subordinate to them; and by “sailors,” the lowest. That by “ships” spiritual merchandise is meant, which are the knowledges of truth and good, may be seen above (n. 406); here natural merchandise; and they take back spiritual, as they think. The reason that by “as many as work at sea” are meant all, whoever they be, who love and kiss that religious persuasion, or acknowledge and venerate it in heart, is because that religious persuasion is signified by “the sea”; for by “the sea” the external of the church is signified, see above (n. 238, 290, 403–405, 470, 565b , 659, 661); and this religious persuasion is merely external. Similar things are signified by this in Isaiah: Thus said Jehovah your redeemer, the holy one of Israel, for your sake have I sent to Babel, and will cast down all her bars, whose cry is in the ships; thus said Jehovah, I who have given a way in the sea and a highway in the mighty waters (Isa. 43:14, 16). “A cry in the ships” is spoken of, as here also, that “they stood afar off, and cried from the ships.” And likewise in Ezekiel: At the voice of the cry of thy captains shall the suburbs tremble, and all that hold the oar shall come down out of thy5 ships, all the sailors and captains of the sea, and shall cry bitterly over thee (Ezek. 27:28–30)."

On which account also there are many heavenly societies of them in the spiritual world, over which are set the honorable, who have lived in the same manner. It has been given to see that some also were set over those societies, who were emperors, kings, dukes, and princes; who indeed acknowledged the pontiff as the highest official of the church, but not as the vicar of the Lord; and who acknowledged likewise some things from the papal bulls, but yet held the Word holy, and acted justly in their administration.

That interior pain and mourning on account of the destruction and condemnation is signified by “casting dust upon the head,” may be evident from the following passages: They shall cry bitterly, and shall cast dust upon their heads, and shall roll themselves in ashes (Ezek. 27:30).

The reason of their casting dust upon their heads, when they grieved inmostly, was because “dust” signifies what is condemned, as is manifest from Gen. 3:14; Matt. 10:14; Mark 6:11; Luke 10:10–12; and “dust upon the head” represented the acknowledgment that of themselves they were condemned, and thus repentance (as in Matt. 11:21; Luke 10:13). That “dust” signifies what is condemned, is because the earth over the hells in the spiritual world consists of mere dust without grass and herbage. 789.

By “being made rich from her costliness” is signified to appease God by the holy things of that religious persuasion, or to believe that for temporal and temporary merchandise or riches they would receive spiritual and eternal merchandise or riches; that is, that for gold, silver, precious stone, pearls, purple, and the other things which are enumerated (verses 12, 13), they would receive blessings and felicities after death. These things are meant by the costliness, with which they say that they were made rich by that city. That they also speak thus is known.

From these things it is manifest, that by these words are signified the things which were quoted above.

Hence now it is that it is said that from that city all that had ships in the sea were made rich by her costliness. 790. Verse 20.

By “a stone like a great millstone” the adulterated and profaned truths of the Word are signified; for by “a stone” truth is signified, and by “mill” is signified the searching for, investigation, and confirmation of truth from the Word (see n. 794); but here the adulteration and profanation of the truth of the Word, as it is said of Babylon.

By “it was not found anymore” is signified that it will no longer appear to the angels. [2] This is signified because all from that religious persuasion who are in its evils and falsities come indeed after death into the world of spirits; for that world is like a forum in which all are at first gathered together; and it is like the stomach into which all foods are first collected. The stomach also corresponds to that world. But at this day, because it is after the last judgment, which was accomplished in the year 1757, it is not allowed them, as before, to tarry in that world, and to form to themselves as it were heavens; but as soon as they arrive there, they are sent to societies which are in conjunction with the hells, into which also they are cast from time to time; and thus care is taken by the Lord, that they shall no longer appear to the angels. It is this, therefore, which is signified by that city, that is, that religious persuasion “being found no more.” [3] Since the truth of the Word adulterated is signified by “the millstone,” and by “the sea,” hell, the Lord therefore says: He that shall offend one of the little ones that believe in me, it were better for him that an ass millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were immersed into the depth of the sea (Matt. 18:6). It is called “a millstone” in Mark 9:42; Luke 17:2. Of Babel nearly the same is said in Jeremiah: When thou hast made an end of reading this book, thou shalt bind a stone upon it, and shalt cast it into the midst of the Euphrates, and shalt say, Thus shall Babel be submerged, and shall not rise again (Jer. 51:63–64). By “the midst of the Euphrates” is meant the same as by “the sea,” because the river Euphrates bounded and separated Assyria, where Babel was, from the land of Canaan."

And the voice of harpers and musicians, and pipers and trumpeters, shall not be heard in thee anymore signifies that there will not be with them any affection of spiritual truth and good, nor any affection of celestial truth and good. By “voice” is meant sound, and every sound corresponds to any affection which is of love, since it arises therefrom. From this it is that the sounds of the harp, of music, and of the pipe, from correspondence signify affections. But the affections are of two kinds, spiritual and celestial; spiritual affections are affections of wisdom, and celestial affections are affections of love. They differ from each other as the heavens, which are distinguished into two kingdoms, the celestial and the spiritual, as has several times been said above. There are therefore musical instruments whose sounds have relation to spiritual affections, and there are those which have relation to celestial affections. The voice or sound of “harpers and musicians” has relation to spiritual affections, and the voice or sound of “pipers and trumpeters” to celestial affections. For the instruments whose sounds are discrete, as stringed instruments, pertain to the class of spiritual affections; and the instruments whose sounds are continuous, as wind instruments, pertain to the class of celestial affections. Hence it is that the voice or sound of “harpers and musicians” signifies the affection of spiritual good and truth, and the voice or sound of “pipers and trumpeters” signifies affection of celestial good and truth. That the sound of the harp from correspondence signifies confession from the affection of spiritual truth, may be seen (n. 276, 661). [2] It is here meant that they who are in the evils and falsities of the Roman Catholic religious persuasion have no affections of spiritual truth and good, nor any affections of celestial truth and good, because it is said that “the voice of harpers and of musicians and of pipers and trumpeters shall not be heard in thee anymore.” The reason that they do not have them is because they cannot be given with them, for they have not any truth from the Word; and because they have no truth, neither have they any good.

And no artificer of any art shall be found in thee anymore signifies that they who are in that religious persuasion from doctrine and from a life according to it, have no understanding of spiritual truth, and hence no thought of spiritual truth, so far as it is from themselves. By “an artificer” in the spiritual sense of the Word is signified one that is intelligent, and thinks from the understanding; in the good sense, one that from the understanding thinks truths, which are heavenly; and in the evil sense, one that from the understanding thinks falsities, which are infernal; and as the latter and the former are of many kinds, and each kind of many species, and each species again of many kinds and species, which, however, are called particulars and singulars, it is therefore said, “no artificer of any art.” By artificers also, from their handicrafts and arts, such things are signified from correspondence as are of wisdom, intelligence, and knowledge. It is said, from correspondence, because all human work corresponds, and likewise every operation provided it be of any use, to such things as are of angelic intelligence. But the works of artificers in gold, silver, and precious stones correspond to one kind of matters or subjects of angelic intelligence; those of artificers in brass, iron, wood and stone to other kinds; and to others, those of artificers in other desirable uses, as cloths, linens, garments and clothing of various kinds. All these correspond, as has been said, because they are works. From these things it may appear that by “an artificer of any art” shall not be found in Babylon is not meant that there shall not be any artificers there, but that there will not be any understanding of spiritual truth, and thence no thought of spiritual truth; but this is only with those who are in that religious persuasion from its"

And everyone wise in heart among them doing the work, they made the habitation, the work of the artificer (Exod. 36:8).

By “the voice of the mill,” nothing else is signified but the inquiry after, examination, and confirmation of spiritual truth, especially from the Word. The reason why this is signified by the voice of the mill or by grinding is because wheat and barley which are ground signify celestial and spiritual good, and therefore meal and fine flour signify truth from that good; for all truth is from good, and all truth which is not from spiritual good is not spiritual. It is said “the voice of the mill” because things spiritual throughout the Word are denoted by things instrumental, which are the ultimates of nature; as for example, spiritual truths and goods are denoted by cups, vials, bottles, platters, and many other vessels, as may be seen above (n. 672).

By “the consummation of the age” is meant the end of the church, when the last judgment is executed; by “the field” the church is signified, because the harvest is there; by “them that grind at the mill” are signified those in the church who search after truths; by “those that are taken” they who find and receive them are signified;"

In the opposite sense, the investigation and confirmation of falsity is signified by a mill, as is evident in these passages: They led away the young men to grind at the mill, and the boys fell down under the wood (Lam. 5:13). Sit in the dust, O daughter of Babel; take the mill and grind meal; uncover thy locks, uncover thy thighs, pass over the streams, let thy nakedness be uncovered, and let thy shame be seen (Isa. 47:1–3). “Take the mill and grind meal” signifies to search after and investigate falsities, for the sake of confirming them. 795. But this shall be illustrated by an example. Who cannot see that they who are in Babylon, have searched after and investigated how they could confirm this enormous falsity, that the bread and wine in the eucharist should be divided, that the bread should be given to the laity and the wine to the clergy. This may be seen from merely reading the confirmation decreed in the council of Trent, and established by a bull, which reads thus: That immediately after consecration the true body and the true blood of Jesus Christ, together with his soul and divinity, are truly, really, and substantially"

That this is to love the Lord, is manifest; for the Lord is omnipresent in that light, because the Divine love and the Divine wisdom are not in place, but are where they are received, and according to the reception.

The acknowledgment and worship of the Lord, and the reading of the Word, cause the presence of the Lord; but these two together with a life according to his commandments effect conjunction with him. In Babylon it is the contrary; there the Lord is acknowledged, but without dominion; and the Word is acknowledged, but without the reading of it. Instead of the Lord the pope is there worshiped, and instead of the Word the papal bulls are acknowledged, according to which they live, and not according to the commandments of the Word. And those bulls have for their end the dominion of the pope and his ministers over heaven and the world, and the commandments of the Word have for their end the Lord’s dominion over heaven and the world; and these are diametrically opposite to each other, like hell and heaven. These things are said, that it may be known, that they have altogether no light of a lamp, that is, enlightenment, and thence the perception of spiritual truth, who are in the Babylonish religious persuasion from doctrine and from a life according to it."

This is concerning the Lord: This is the judgment, that light is come into the world; he that doeth the truth cometh to the light (John 3:19, 21). Jesus said, Yet a little while is the light with you; walk while ye have the light, lest darkness seize upon you; while ye have the light, believe in the light, that ye may be sons of the light (John 12:35, 36). Jesus said, I am come a light into the world, that everyone who believeth in me, may not abide in darkness (John 12:46). Jesus said, I am the light of the world (John 9:5). Simeon said, Mine eyes have seen thy salvation, a light for the revelation of the nations (Luke 2:30–32).

By “voice” is here signified joy, because it is that of a bridegroom and bride. By “a bridegroom,” in the highest sense, is meant the Lord as to the Divine good; and by “a bride” the church is meant as to the Divine truth from the Lord. For the church is a church from the reception of the Lord’s Divine good in the Divine truths which are from him. That the Lord is called the bridegroom, and likewise the husband; and that the church is called the bride and also the wife, is manifest from the Word. It is from this that the heavenly marriage, which is the conjunction of good and truth, is therefrom, will be seen in the small work Conjugial Love. Now because this heavenly marriage is effected by the reception of the Divine good from the Lord in the Divine truths from the Word by the men of the church, it is manifest that there is no conjunction of good and truth with those who are in that religious persuasion from doctrine and life thence, because they have no conjunction with the Lord; but they have conjunction with men living and dead. And this conjunction, with those who are in the love of dominating from the love of self over the holy Divine things of the Lord, and over the Lord, is like conjunction with the devil, who, as was said in the preceding article, is that love; and to approach the devil that through him one may come to God, is detestable.

John the Baptist says this of the Lord. Jesus said, As long as the bridegroom is with them, the sons of the marriage cannot fast; the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, then shall they fast (Matt. 9:15; Mark 2:19–20; Luke 5:34–35)."

My soul shalt exult over God, as a bridegroom putteth on a miter, and as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels (Isa. 61:10).

The Lord said to Peter: Upon this same rock will I build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail over it; I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of the heavens, and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in the heavens, and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in the heavens (Matt. 16:18–19). The Divine truth which is meant by “the rock” upon which the Lord will build his church is what Peter then confessed; which was: Thou art the Christ, the son of the living God (Matt. 16:16). By “the keys of the kingdom of the heavens,” which are that whatsoever that rock, which is the Lord, “shall bind on earth shall be bound in the heavens, and whatsoever it shall loose on earth shall be loosed in the heavens,” is meant that the Lord has power over heaven and earth, as he also says (Matt. 28:18); thus the power of saving the men who from faith of heart are in that confession of Peter. [2] The Lord’s Divine operation to save men is from firsts by ultimates; and this is what is meant by “whatsoever he shall bind or loose on earth shall be bound or loosed in heaven.” The ultimates by which the Lord operates are on earth, and indeed with men.

[3] Who cannot see, if he will, that the salvation of man is the continuous operation of the Lord with man from the first of his infancy even to the last of his life, and that this is a work purely Divine, and can never be given to any man? It is so Divine that it is at once the work of omnipresence, omniscience, and omnipotence; and that man’s reformation and regeneration, thus his salvation, are all of the Lord’s Divine providence, may be seen in Divine Providence, from beginning to end. [4] The very coming of the Lord into the world was solely on account of man’s salvation. For the sake of this he assumed the human, removed the hells, and glorified himself, and put on omnipotence even in the ultimates, which is meant by “sitting at the right hand of God.” What, therefore, is more abominable, than to found a religious persuasion, by which it is sanctioned that the Divine authority and power belong to man and no longer to the Lord; and that heaven will be opened and shut, if only a priest says, “I absolve,” or “I excommunicate”; and that sin, even if enormous, is remitted, provided he says, “I remit”? There are many devils in the world, who, in order to escape temporal punishments, seek and obtain absolution from a diabolical crime by arts and gifts.

By these words nothing else can be signified than that the Lord will judge all according to the goods and truths of the church.

Verse 10. “And I fell down before his feet to adore him; and he said, See thou do it not; I am thy fellow servant and of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus; adore God” signifies that the angels of heaven are not to be adored and invoked, because there is nothing Divine in them; but that they are associated with men, as brethren with brethren, with those who worship the Lord, and thus that in consociation with them the Lord alone is to be adored (n. 818). “For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy” signifies that the acknowledgment that the Lord is the God of heaven and earth, and at the same time a life according to his precepts, in the universal sense the all of the Word and of doctrine therefrom (n. 819).

By “a great multitude in heaven” are signified the angels of the lower heavens; by “their voice saying Alleluia” is signified thanksgiving, confession, and celebration of the Lord by them; by “Alleluia,” in the Hebrew language, is signified praise ye God; therefore it was an expression of thanksgiving, confession, and celebration of the Lord from joy of heart, as appears from these passages: Bless Jehovah, O my soul. Alleluia (Ps. 104:35). Blessed be Jehovah the God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting; and let all the people say, Amen. Alleluia (Ps. 106:48). We will bless Jah from now even to eternity. Alleluia (Ps. 115:18). Let every soul praise Jah. Alleluia (Ps. 150:6; besides other places, as Ps. 105:45; 106:1; 111:1; 112:1; 113:1, 9; 116:19; 117:2; 135:3; 148:1, 14; 149:1, 9; 150:1). That it is on account of the rejection of the Babylonians is evident from the preceding chapter, which treats of the Babylonians, for which reason it is said, “After these things,” and also from what follows (verses 2–3) in this chapter. That the angels of the lower heavens are meant by “a great multitude in heaven,” is plain from verse 4 of this chapter, where it is said that “the twenty-four elders and the four animals adored him that sat upon the throne, saying Amen. Alleluia,” by whom the angels of the higher heavens are meant. 804. Salvation, and glory, and honor, and power, unto the Lord our God signifies that now there is salvation from the Lord, because now there is a reception of Divine truth and Divine good from his Divine power.

To say that salvation, glory, honor, and power belong unto the Lord is according to the sense of the letter; as also in other places, that to the Lord belongeth blessing, but this, when considered in the spiritual sense, means that these things, being in the Lord, are also from the Lord, here, that now they are communicated by him to angels and men in consequence of the Babylonians being removed and rejected, who intercepted, weakened, and prevented the influx of those things from the Lord; in like manner as black clouds in the world, when they come between the sun and men; for as the light of the sun of this world is intercepted, weakened, and obstructed by the interposition of black clouds, so is the light of the sun of heaven, which is the Lord, by the black falsities interposed by the Babylonians. The thing is altogether similar, only that one is natural, and the other spiritual. Falsities also in the spiritual world appear like clouds, dark and black according to their quality. This is likewise the cause, that not until after the last judgment was the spiritual sense of the Word revealed, and that the Lord alone is the God of heaven and earth. For by the last judgment the Babylonians were removed, and also the Reformed who confessed faith alone; whose falsities were like dusky clouds interposed between the Lord and men on earth; and were likewise like cold, that takes away spiritual heat, which is the love of good, and truth. 805. Verse 2. For true and just are his judgments; for he hath judged the great harlot, who corrupted the earth with her whoredom signifies because in justice the profane Babylonish religious persuasion is condemned, which has destroyed the Lord’s church by foul adulterations of the Word. By “true and just are thy judgments” the Divine truths and goods of the Word are signified, according to which judgment is executed by the Lord (n. 668, 689); which together are called “justice”; for by justice, in speaking of the Lord, nothing else is signified; as below (verse 11; also Isa. 63:1; Jer. 23:5, 6; 33:15, 16).

By “her whoredom” the adulteration of the Word is signified (n. 134), and by “earth” the church (n. 285, 721). 806. And he hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand signifies retribution on account of the injuries and violence offered to the souls of the worshipers of the Lord. That by “he hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand” is signified retribution on account of the injuries and violence offered to the souls of the worshipers of the Lord, because by “he avenged” is signified retribution. By “shedding blood” is signified to offer violence to the Lord’s divinity and to the Word (n. 327, 684); here to the worshipers of the Lord, who are meant by “his servants.” They offered injuries and violence to the souls of these by transferring to themselves the Divine worship of the Lord, and by prohibiting the reading of the Word. It is said of the Lord, that he avenged or revenged the blood of his servants, as if he did this from vengeance or revenge; but still it is not from vengeance or revenge, as it is not from anger and wrath, which however are attributed to the Lord in many places in the Word, see above (n. 525, 635, 658, 673). Anger and vengeance are said of the Lord, when the evil separated from the good are cast into hell, which is done at the day of the last judgment; on which account that day is called “a day of anger,” and likewise “anger”; also “a day of vengeance”; not that the Lord is angry and avenges, but that they are angry with the Lord, and breathe vengeance against him. It is as when a malefactor, after sentence is passed, is angry at the law, and breathes vengeance against the judge; for the law is not angry, nor is the judge revengeful. [2] “Vengeance” is meant in this sense in the following passages: The day of vengeance is in my heart, and the year of my redeemed is come (Isa. 63:4).

Behold, your God will come with vengeance, with the retribution of God will he come, and he will save you (Isa. 35:4). These are the days of vengeance, that all things that are written may be fulfilled (Luke 21:22). Here it treats of the consummation of the age, when the last judgment comes: The spirit of the Lord Jehovih is upon me, to proclaim the day of the good pleasure of Jehovah, and the day of vengeance of our God, to comfort all that mourn (Isa. 61:1–2). Shall not my soul take vengeance for this (Jer. 5:9, 29)? I will take vengeance on Babel, nor will I make a man to intercede (Isa. 47:3). The thought is against Babel to destroy it, because this is the vengeance of Jehovah, the vengeance of his temple (Jer. 51:11, 36). Sing, ye nations, his peopl e; for he hath avenged the blood of his servants, and he will render vengeance to his enemies, and will expiate his land, his people (Deut. 32:43). 807. Verse 3. And a second time they said Alleluia, and her smoke went up for ages of ages signifies thanksgiving and celebration of the Lord from joy, that that profane religious persuasion is condemned to eternity. “That they said a second time” is from their varying affection of joy, that they were liberated from infestation from those who were in that religious persuasion, also from fear lest they should rise again and infest again. That thanksgiving and celebration of the Lord is signified by “Alleluia” may be seen above (n. 803). By “her smoke” is signified that religious persuasion as to its direful falsities, since falsities from evil appear like the smokes from fire (n. 422); the fire here is the love of self (n. 468, 494, 766). That by “the smoke of a burning,” when treating of Babylon, profanation is signified (n. 766, 767). By “its going up for ages of ages” is signified her damnation to eternity."

By “falling down and adoring” is signified humiliation, and from the humiliation adoration, as above (n. 370). By “the twenty-four elders and the four animals” the higher heavens are signified (n. 369). By “him that sitteth upon the throne” is meant the Lord as the God of heaven, and as the judge of the universe; since by “the throne” is signified heaven and the kingdom there (n. 14, 221, 222), and likewise judgment; here judgment, because it is concerning the judgment upon Babel, which precedes. That “he that sitteth upon the throne” is the Lord, may be seen below. By “Amen. Alleluia,” is signified the confirmation of the thanksgiving, confession, and celebration made by the angels of the lower heavens. By “Amen” is signified confirmation and consent from the truth (n. 23, 28, 61, 371, 375); and by “Alleluia” is signified thanksgiving, confession, and celebration of the Lord (n. 803). That it is those which were made by the angels of the lower heavens is because they first spoke, and celebrated the Lord as the God of heaven, the judge, and the avenger; and said “Alleluia”; as is manifest from verses 1 and 2, and from the explanation above (n. 803, 804). The confirmation of these things by the angels of the higher heavens is signified by “Amen. Alleluia.” [2] That “he that sitteth upon the throne” is the Lord is manifest from Revelation (chap. 1:4; 2:8; 3:21; 4:2–6, 9; 5:13; 6:16; 7:9–11; 22:1, 3); in which places it is said, ”God” and “lamb” “upon the throne.” By “God” there the Divine itself of the Lord is meant, which is called the Father; and by “the lamb” the Divine human, which is called the son (n. 269, 291), thus the Lord alone.

By “the voice which came out of the throne” is signified influx from the Lord into heaven. That it is from the Lord is because “he that sitteth upon the throne” was the Lord, as was shown just above (n. 808). Therefore by “the voice” that came out therefrom is meant influx; for the Lord, because he is above the heavens, and appears before the angels as a sun, does not speak from it to the angels, but flows in; and that which flows in is received in heaven, and is uttered. Wherefore that voice, although from the throne, yet was heard by John out of heaven, and thus from the angels there; and whatever the angels speak out of heaven is from the Lord. By “Praise our God” is signified that they should worship the Lord as the only God of heaven. That “to praise God” is to worship him will be seen below. By “all his servants” are signified all who are in the truths of faith (n. 3, 380); by “all that fear him” are signified they who are in the goods of love (n. 527, 628). [2] That “to praise God” signifies to worship him, and hence that the praise of him is the worship of him is evident from many passages in the Word, a few only of which are adduced: Suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of them that praise God (Luke 2:13, 20).

By “the small and the great” in the natural sense they are meant who are in a lesser and in a greater degree ofdignity, but in the spiritual sense those who are in a lesser and in agreater degree of worship of the Lord, and thus who worship the Lord less and more holily and fully from the truths of faith and the goods of love.

By “the voice of many waters” is signified the joy of the angels of the middle heaven, as above (n. 614). The joy of these was thus heard because “many waters” signify truths in abundance (n. 50, 614, 685); and the angels of the middle heaven are in truths, because in intelligence. By “the voice of mighty thunders” the joy of the angels of the highest heaven is signified. That their voice or discourse is heard as thunder, may be seen above (n. 615).

That these things are said of the new church to be established by the Lord is evident from the three verses following, in which it is said, “For the marriage of the lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready.” Also, “Happy are they that are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb.” On account of this is the joy of all the heavens, which is described in this and the following verse. 812. Verse 7. Let us rejoice and exult, and give the glory to him; for the marriage of the lamb is come signifies joy of soul and heart, and thence the glorification of the Lord, that henceforth there may be a full marriage of him with the church. By “rejoice and exult” is signified joy of soul and heart. Joy of soul is joy of the understanding, or from the truth of faith; and joy of heart is joy of the will, or from the goods of love. The two are mentioned on account of the marriage of truth and good in each thing of the Word, spoken of above (n. 373, 689).

[2] It may be evident almost without explanation, that when the Lord’s human is acknowledged to be Divine, there is effected a full marriage of the Lord and the church; for it is known in the Reformed Christian world, that the church is a church from the marriage of the Lord with her; for the Lord is called the Lord of the vineyard, and the church is the vineyard; and the Lord is also called the bridegroom and husband, and the church is called the bride and wife. That the Lord is called the bridegroom, and the church the bride, may be seen (n. 797). That there is then the full marriage of the Lord and the church, when his human is acknowledged to be Divine is manifest; for then God the Father and he are acknowledged to be one, as the soul and the body. When this is acknowledged, the Father is not approached for the sake of the son; but then the Lord himself is approached, and God the Father through him; because the Father is in him, as the soul is in the body, as was said. Before the Lord’s human is acknowledged to be Divine, there is indeed a marriage of the Lord with the church; but only with those who approach the Lord, and think of his Divine, and not at all whether his human is Divine or not. The simple in faith and in heart do this; but rarely the learned and erudite. Moreover also there cannot be given three husbands to one wife, nor three souls to one body; and therefore, unless one God is acknowledged, in whom is the trinity, and that that God is the Lord, there is no marriage. [3] That from this time that marriage may take place, because it could not fully take place until after the Babylonians were separated in the spiritual world by the last judgment; as also the Philistines, who are they that profess faith alone; and because their separation is treated of in what goes before, it is said “from henceforth.” That there is a marriage of the church with the Lord may be evident from these passages: Jesus said, The children of the marriage cannot mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them (Matt. 9:15; Mark 2:19)."

The kingdom of the heavens is like unto ten virgins, who went forth to meet the bridegroom; of whom five, being ready, went in with the bridegroom to the marriage (Matt. 25:1–12). That here the Lord meant himself is manifest from verse 13 following, where he said: Watch, for ye know neither the day nor the hour in which the son of man will come (Matt. 25:13). And in another place: Let your loins be girded and your candles shining, and ye like to them that wait for their Lord, when he is about to return from the marriage (Luke 12:35–36). 813. And his wife hath made herself ready signifies that they who will be of this church, which is the new Jerusalem, are collected together, inaugurated, and instructed. By “the wife” the Lord’s new church is signified, which is the new Jerusalem; which is clearly manifest from chap. 21, following, where are these words: I saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband (Rev. 21:2). An angel came unto me, saying, Come, I will show thee the bride, the lamb’s wife; and he showed me the great city, the holy Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from God (Rev. 21:9–10). By “his wife hath made herself ready” is signified that they who will be of that new church of the Lord are collected together,inaugurated, and instructed; and because these things are signified by “she hath made herself ready,” it therefore follows that the wife “was arrayed in fine linen clean and bright”; by which is signifiedinauguration by instruction; and therefore there also follows the"

And it was given to her that she should be clothed in fine linen clean and bright signifies that they who will be of the Lord’s new church are instructed by the Lord in genuine and pure truths through the Word. By “it was given to her” is meant to the wife, by whom is signified the Lord’s new church, which is the new Jerusalem, as just above (n. 812). By “being clothed” is signified to be instructed in truths, because truths are signified by “garments” (n. 166); and by “white garments” genuine truths (n. 212). By “fine linen clean and bright” is signified shining from good and pure truths; and because pure truth is not given from any other source than from the Lord through the Word, therefore this also is signified. It is called “clean and bright,” because “clean” signifies that which is free from evil, thus that which shines from good; and “bright” signifies what is free from falsity, thus what is pure from truth. By “fine linen” or “linen cloth” genuine truth is signified in the following places also: O Jerusalem, I have clothed thee with needlework, I have girded thee with fine linen, and I have covered thee with silk; thus wast thou adorned with gold and silver, and thy raiment was fine linen and silk (Ezek. 16:10, 13). Fine linen in needlework from Egypt was thy spreading forth (Ezek. 27:7). This is concerning Tyre, by which the church as to the knowledges of truth and good is signified. The armies in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen white and clean (Rev. 14). Joseph was clothed in garments of fine linen by Pharaoh (Gen. 41:42). This signifies the same. Truth from the Word with them, though not in them is signified by: The fine linen of Babylon (Rev. 18:12, 16)."

They made tunics of cotton for Aaron and for his sons (Exod. 39:27). Thou shalt make the habitation of cotton interwoven, and hyacinth, and purple, and scarlet double dyed (Exod. 26:1; 36:8). Thou shalt make hangings for the court of cotton interwoven (Exod. 27:9, 18; 38:9). Also the veil of the court with cotton interwoven (Exod. 38:18). 815. For the fine linen is the just deeds of the saints signifies that through truths from the Word those who are of the Lord’s church have the goods of life. By “fine linen” are signified genuine truths, which are truths from the Lord through the Word, as just above (n. 814). By “just deeds” are signified the goods of life with those who are in truths (n. 668). By “the saints” are signified those who are of the Lord’s church (n. 173, 586). That “just deeds” are the goods of life with those who are in truths is because no one can be called just, unless he lives according to truths; for in the natural sense everyone is called just who lives well according to the civil and moral laws; but in the spiritual sense he is called “just” who lives well according to the Divine laws, and the Divine laws are truths from the Word. He who believes himself to be just, consequently in the good of life, without the truths according to which he should live is much deceived; for a man cannot be reformed and regenerated, consequently become good, except by truths, and by life according to them. Hence it is manifest that by “the fine linen is the just deeds of the saints” is signified that those who are of the Lord’s church have the goods of life through truths from the Word.

And he said unto me, Write, Happy are they that are called to the marriage supper of the lamb signifies an angel sent from heaven to John, and speaking with him concerning the Lord’s new church, and saying that it was given to know on earth, that those have eternal life who receive the things which are of that church. That it was an angel sent from heaven to John that spoke these things to him may be evident from the following verse, that John fell down at his feet to adore him; and that the angel answered that he was his fellow servant; therefore that not he, but God, was to be adored. That the former things which John heard were from heaven itself, and by many angels speaking together from the Lord is plainly manifest from the preceding verses 5–7; where it is said that “a voice came out of the throne,” and that thus was heard “as it were a voice of a great multitude, and as of many waters, and as of mighty thunders,” and of them that said, “Let us rejoice and exult.” These were in the plural; but now it is in the singular, and thus by a single angel sent to him. [2] But I will relate how it is when angels speak with man. They never speak with him from heaven; but the voice which is heard thence is from the Lord through heaven. But when it is given to the angels to speak with a man, they send one from their society, who is near the man; and they speak with the man through him. He who is sent is the subject of many, and it was such a subject who now spoke with John. This was done, that it might be announced on earth, that the whole heaven acknowledges the Lord alone as the God of heaven, and that he alone is to be adored; also that the new church is to be established by the Lord on the earth, as it has been established in the heavens; for a church is first established in the heavens by the Lord, and then through the heavens on the earth. This is the arcanum in these words. [3] Now to the explanation. “Write” signifies that he should commit this to posterity for remembrance (n. 39, 63, 639); here, that he should make these things known; this is meant by “write.”"

They are called “happy,” who have eternal life (n. 639). By “the marriage of the lamb” the new church is signified, which is in conjunction with the Lord, as above (n. 812). By “the called” are meant all who receive (n. 744). All are called, indeed; but they who do not receive, reject the call. [4] It is called “the marriage supper of the lamb,” because this is done in the last state of the church, which is called evening; and in the evening suppers take place; but the first state of the new church is called morning. In the evening man is called to the church; and when the called are present, the morning comes. That the last state of the church is called evening and night, and its first state the dawn and morning, may be seen above (n. 151). And because it was the last state of the Jewish church, and thus evening, when the Lord went from Jerusalem to suffer, the Lord therefore then supped with the disciples, and instituted the eucharist; whence it is called the holy supper; by which also is effected the conjunction of the Lord with the man of the church, or a marriage, if the man after repentance goes directly to him; but if otherwise, presence is effected, and not conjunction. From this it may be evident what is signified by “supper” and “to sup” elsewhere in the Word. 817. And he said, These are the true words of God signifies that this is to be believed, because from the Lord; namely, that “they are happy who are called to the marriage supper of the lamb,” that is, that they on earth who receive the things which are of the Lord’s new church, have eternal life. 818.

By “having the testimony of Jesus” is signified that he is in like manner in conjunction with the Lord, through the acknowledgment of the Divine in his human, and through a life according to his commandments. That this is signified by “having the testimony of Jesus” will be seen in the following paragraph. That the angels of heaven are not superior to men, but that they are their equals, and that they are therefore equally the Lord’s servants, as men are, is because all the angels have been men, born in the world, and not any of them were created immediately; as may be evident from the things which are written and shown in Heaven and Hell, published at London, 1758. They indeed excel men in wisdom; but this is for the reason that they are in a spiritual state, and thence in the light of heaven, and not in a natural state, and so in the light of the world, as men are upon earth. But as far as any angel excels in wisdom, so far he acknowledges that he is not above men, but like them; on which account there is not any conjunction of men with the angels, but there is consociation with them. Conjunction is given with the Lord alone. But how conjunction with the Lord, and consociation with the angels, by the Word, are effected, see Doctrine of the Sacred Scripture (n. 62–69). 819. For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy signifies that the acknowledgment that the Lord is the God of heaven and earth, and at the same time a life according to his commandments is in the universal sense the all of the Word and of doctrine therefrom.

By that testimony is “the spirit of prophecy,” is signified that it is the all of the Word and of doctrine therefrom; for the Word in the universal sense treats only of the Lord, and of life according to his commandments. Hence it is that the Lord is the Word; for he is the Word, because the Word is from him, and treats of him alone, and teaches solely how he is to be acknowledged and worshiped; and these are the commandments of the Word, which are called Divine truths, according to which one must live, that he may be able to come into conjunction with the Lord. That the Word treats of the Lord alone, and that it is thence that the Lord is called the Word, may be seen in Doctrine of the Lord (n. 1–7, 8–11, 19–28, 37–44); and in Doctrine of the Sacred Scripture (n. 80–90, 98–100). This is also what the Lord says, that: The spirit of truth, which is the Holy Spirit, will testify concerning the Lord; and that he will not speak from himself, but that he will receive of the things which are of the Lord’s, and announce them (John 15:26; 16:13, 15). 820.

By “a horse” is signified the understanding of the Word, and by “a white horse” the interior understanding of the Word (n. 298); and as this is signified by “a white horse,” and as the spiritual sense is the interior understanding of the Word, therefore that sense is signified here by “the white horse.” The reason that this is the coming of the Lord is because it manifestly appears by that sense that the Lord is the Word, and that the Word treats of him alone, and that he is the God of heaven and earth, and that from him alone the new church exists. The Lord said that: They should see the son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with glory and power (Matt. 17:5; 24:30; 26:64; Mark 14:61, 62; Luke 9:34–35; 21:27; Rev. 1:7; Acts 1:9, 11)."

Everyone who does not think beyond the sense of the letter, believes that when the last judgment shall come, the Lord will appear in the clouds of heaven with the angels and sounds of trumpets. But that this is not meant, but that he will appear in the Word, may be evident from the explanation above (n. 24, 642). And the Lord appears manifestly in the spiritual sense of the Word. It appears not only that he is the Word, that is, the Divine truth itself, and that he is the inmost of the Word, and thence the all of it; but also that he himself is the one God, in whom is the trinity, and thus the only God of heaven and earth; and moreover that he came into the world, that he might glorify his human, that is, make it Divine. [2] The human which he glorified, that is, made Divine, was the natural human, which he could not glorify or make Divine but by taking on the human in a virgin in the natural world; to which he then united his Divine, which he had from eternity. That unition was effected by temptations admitted into the human that he had taken, the last of which was the passion of the cross, and at the same time by the fulfilling of all things of the Word; not only by the fulfilling of all things of the Word in its natural sense, but also by the fulfilling of all things of the Word in its spiritual sense and in its celestial sense; in which, as was said above, he alone is treated of. But on these things, see what are manifested in Doctrine of the Lord, and in Doctrine of the Sacred Scripture. Now, because the Lord is the Word, and the Word became flesh (John 1:1–2, 14), and the Word became flesh that he might fulfill it, it is manifest that the Lord’s coming in the Word is meant by his appearing “in the clouds of heaven.” That “the clouds of heaven” signify the Word in the sense of the letter, may be seen above (n. 24, 642). It is manifest that the Lord’s appearing in the Word is meant, because the interior understanding of the Word is signified by “the white horse,” and it is said that the name of him that sat upon the horse is “The Word of God,” and that his name is “King of kings and Lord of lords” (verses 13, 16)."

That the spiritual sense of the Word is at this day revealed, concerning which no one in the Christian world has before known anything, may be seen in Arcana Coelestia, where the two books of Moses, Genesis and Exodus are explained according to that sense; also in Doctrine of the Sacred Scripture (n. 5–26); in a little work White Horse from beginning to end, and in the things collected there from Arcana Coelestia concerning the sacred Scripture; and besides in these explanations upon Revelation, where not a single verse can be understood without the spiritual sense. 821. And he that sitteth upon him is called faithful and true, and in justice he doth judge and make war signifies the Lord as to the Word, that it is the Divine good itself and the Divine truth itself, from both of which he executes judgment, and separates the good from the evil. By “he that sitteth upon him,” that is, upon the white horse, the Lord is meant as to the Word. That it is the Lord as to the Word is manifest from verse 13 seq., where it is said that “he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood, and his name is called the Word of God.” By “faithful and true” are signified the Divine good and the Divine truth; by “faithful,” the Divine good, because this is faithful. That “faithful,” when speaking of men, means one who is in the inmost or third heaven, and thus who is in celestial good, may be seen above (n. 744). That by “true,” when speaking of the Lord, the Divine truth is signified is manifest. That by “justice” both are signified, as well good as truth, and, where it is speaking of the Lord, the Divine good and Divine truth, may be seen above (n. 805). Hence it follows, that by “judging from justice” is signified to execute judgment from the Divine good and the Divine truth. That all judgment is executed by the Lord through the Word, and thus that the Word itself judges everyone, may be seen above (n. 233).

And upon his head were many diadems signifies the Divine truths of the Word from him. “Upon the head” signifies from the Lord; for by the head wisdom from love is signified; and man is ruled from the head by wisdom from love. “Diadems upon the head” were seen because the Divine truths of the Word, which are signified by “diadems,” are from him. That “diadems” signify the Divine truths of the Word, may be seen (n. 231, 540). That “the head” when speaking of the Lord signifies the Divine wisdom of the Divine love (n. 47); what more is signified by the head (n. 538, 565). In the spiritual world the Divine truths of the Word correspond to diadems, and they appear there from correspondence, and in heaven upon the head of those who hold the Word as holy. Hence it is that “diadems” signify the Divine truths of the Word in the sense of its letter. The reason is because the sense of the letter is translucent from its spiritual and celestial sense, as a diadem is from light. 824. Having a name written which no one knew but himself signifies that no one sees of what quality the Word is in its spiritual and celestial senses but the Lord, and he to whom he reveals it.

It is said, “a name written,” because the Word is both with men on earth and with the angels in the heavens; see Doctrine of the Sacred Scripture (n. 70–75).

By a garment is signified truth clothing good (n. 166, 212, 328); and when concerning the Word, it signifies the Word in the sense of the letter; for this is like a garment, in which its spiritual and celestial senses are clothed. By “the blood” is signified violence offered to the Lord’s Divine and to the Word (n. 327, 684). The reason that this is signified is that the Lord’s Divine truth in the Word is signified by blood (n. 379, 653); wherefore by “shedding blood” is signified to offer violence to the Lord’s Divine and to the Word. By “the Word of God” is signified here the Word in the sense of the letter; for violence has been offered to this, but not to the Word in the spiritual sense, because this sense has not been known; and if it had been known, violence would have been offered to it also. Wherefore that sense was not revealed until after the last judgment was accomplished, and the new church was to be instituted by the Lord. Nor is it revealed to anyone at this day, except to him who is in Divine truths from the Lord; see Doctrine of the Sacred Scripture (n. 26). [2] That violence has been offered to the Lord’s Divine and to the Word is plainly manifest from the Roman Catholic religious persuasion, and from the religious persuasion of the Reformed concerning faith alone. The Roman Catholic religious persuasion gives forth that the Lord’s human is not Divine, wherefore they have transferred all things of the Lord to themselves; also that the Word is to be interpreted only by them; yet the interpretation by them is everywhere contrary to the Divine truth of the Word, as was shown in the explanation of the preceding chapter 18. It is manifest from this, that violence is offered to the Word by that religious persuasion. In like manner by the religious persuasion of the Reformed concerning faith alone.

Wherefore art thou red as to thy garment, and thy garments as of him that treadeth in the wine press, whence victory is sprinkled upon my garments, and I have polluted all my vesture (Isa. 63:1–3).

It may there be seen, that by “the rod of iron” with which the nations should be smitten, are signified truths from the sense of the letter of the Word confirmed by rational things from the natural man; and likewise in n. 148, 485. That faith alone without works is dead is clearly manifest in James 2:17, 20; who also says: Be ye doers of the Word, not hearers only; how ye deceive yourselves (James 1:22 seq.). Paul says in like manner: Not the hearers of the law will be justified by God, but the doers of the law will be justified (Rom. 2:13). 829. And he treadeth the wine press of the wine of the fury and anger of God almighty signifies that the Lord endured alone all the evils of the church, and all the violence offered to the Word, thus to himself.

By “treading the wine press” of that wine is signified to endure them, to fight against them, and to condemn"

For the Lord came into the world to subjugate the hells, which had then increased so that they began to infest the angels; and he subjugated them by combats against them, and thus by temptations; for spiritual temptations are nothing else than combats against the hells. And because every man is in consort with spirits as to his affections and thence thoughts, an evil man with spirits from hell and a good man with angels from heaven, therefore when the Lord subjugated the hells, he not only liberated the angels of heaven from infestation, but also the men of the earth. [2] This therefore is what is signified by these words in Isaiah: He hath borne our diseases, and he hath carried our pains; also he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities; and by his wound healing is given to us; Jehovah hath laid upon him the iniquity of us all; he sustained exaction; he was cut off out of the land of the living, for the transgression of my people was he stricken; and he hath laid guilt upon his soul (Isa. 53:4–10). These things are concerning the Lord, and concerning his temptations by the hells, and at length by the Jews, by whom he was crucified. The Lord’s combats are also described in Isa. 63:1–10; where are these words also: Thy garments are as of him that treadeth in the wine press; I have trodden the wine press alone (Isa. 63:2–3). By this is signified that he alone endured the evils and falsities of the church, and all the violence offered to the Word, thus to himself. It is said, the violence offered to the Word, and thus to himself, because the Lord is the Word; and violence is offered to the Word and to the Lord himself by the Roman Catholic religious persuasion, also by the religious persuasion with the Reformed concerning faith alone. The Lord endured the evils and falsities of both, when he executed the last judgment, by which he again subjugated the hells; and unless they had been subjugated again, no flesh could have been saved; as he says in Matt. 24:21, 22."

And he hath upon his garment and upon his thigh a name written, King of kings and Lord of lords signifies that the Lord teaches in the Word what he is, that he is the Divine truth of the Divine wisdom and the Divine good of the Divine love, thus that he is the God of the universe. By the Lord’s “garment” the Word as to the Divine truth is signified, as above (n. 825). By the Lord’s “thigh” is signified the Word as to Divine good. The “thighs” and “loins” signify conjugial love; and as that love is the fundamental of all loves, therefore “the thighs” and “the loins” signify the good of love. That this is from correspondence may be seen above (n. 213). Therefore when “the thigh” is spoken of in relation to the Lord, it signifies himself as to the good of love; here also the Word as to the same. By “the name written” the Lord’s quality is signified as above (n. 824). By “King of kings” is meant the Lord as to the Divine truth of the Divine wisdom, and by “Lord of lords” is meant the Lord as to the Divine good of the Divine love. The like is signified by the Lord’s kingdom and dominion, where both are mentioned, see above (n. 664). [2] As it is said, “King of kings and Lord of lords,” and by them the Lord as to the Divine truth and the Divine good is meant, it is therefore said also, “a name written upon his garment and upon his thigh”; and by “the name written upon his garment” is signified the Word as to the Divine truth, and by “the name written upon his thigh,” the Word as to the Divine good. Both are in the Word. The Divine truth of the Word is in its spiritual sense, which is for the angels of the middle or second heaven, who are in intelligence from Divine truths; and the Divine good of the Word in its celestial sense, which is for the angels of the highest or third heaven, who are in wisdom from Divine goods. But the latter sense is deeply hidden, perceptible to those only who are in love to the Lord from the Lord. That it is the Lord is openly said above in Revelation: They shall fight with the lamb; the lamb shall overcome them, for he is Lord of lords and King of kings (Rev. 17:14)."

Over the head of the cherubim was the appearance of a man upon a throne; from the appearance of his loins and upward, and from the appearance of his loins downward was the appearance of fire and brightness round about (Ezek. 1:26–28). By the “man upon the throne” is meant the Lord; by “the appearance of fire from the loins upward and downward” his Divine love is signified; and by “the brightness round about” is signified the Divine wisdom therefrom. The man seen by Daniel, whose loins were girded with gold of Uphaz (Dan. 10:6) was an angel in whom was the Lord; by “the gold of Uphaz” the good of love is signified. The like is signified by “the thigh” (Isa. 5:27; Ps. 45:3; and elsewhere). Concerning the correspondence of the thighs or loins with conjugial love, which is the fundamental of all loves, see Arcana Coelestia (n. 5050–5062). 831. Verse 17.

By “the angel standing in the sun” is meant the Lord in the Divine love; by “the angel” the Lord is meant, and by “the sun” his Divine love.

By crying “come” the calling is signified, and by “gather yourselves together” is signified the calling together. [2] That the Lord is meant in the Word by “an angel,” may be seen above (n. 5, 170, 258, 344, 465, 649, 657, 718); the more so here, as he was seen to stand in the sun; and no angel appears in the sun, for the Lord is the sun of the spiritual world; wherefore the Lord alone is there. That by “the sun,” when speaking of the Lord, the Divine love is signified, may be seen (n. 53, 414). That by “crying with a great voice,” when said of the Lord in the Divine love, is signified to speak or flow in from Divine zeal is manifest; because the Divine zeal is of the Divine love, here for the salvation of men. That such things as are of the understanding and thence of the thought are signified by “birds,” see above (n. 757); here they who are in the spiritual affection of truth, and think concerning heaven, since it is said, “the birds that fly in the midst of heaven”; and by “flying in the midst of heaven” is signified to observe, attend, and think (n. 245, 415).

By “commanders of thousands” are signified those who are in the knowledges of good and truth, and abstractly those knowledges (n. 337). By “the mighty” are signified they who are in erudition from doctrine from the Word, and abstractly erudition thence (n. 337). By “horses” the understanding of the Word is signified; and by “them that sit upon horses” are signified they who are in wisdom from the understanding of the Word, and abstractly wisdom thence (n. 298, 820). By “the free and bond” are signified they who know from themselves and they who know from others (n. 337, 604). By “small and great” those are signified who are in a lesser and in a greater degree (n. 527, 810). It is manifest from these things, that by “they may eat their flesh” is signified the appropriation of goods from the Lord through the truths of the Word and of doctrine thence in every sense, degree, and kind. [2] It is to be known that no man has any spiritual good from the Lord, except through truths from the Word; for the truths of the Word are in the light of heaven, and its goods are in the heat of that light; wherefore, unless the understanding is in the light of heaven through the Word, the will cannot come into the heat of heaven. Love and charity cannot be formed except through truths from the Word; a man cannot be reformed except through truths therefrom. The church itself with man is formed by them; but not by those truths in the understanding alone, but by a life according to them; the truths thus enter into the will, and become goods. Thus the face of truth is turned into the face of good; for that which is of the will and thus of the love is called good, and everything which is of the will or love is also of man’s life. From this it may be seen that the appropriation of good through truths in every sense, degree, and kind from the Lord through the Word is here meant by “eating the flesh” of those that are named.

Who cannot see that there is a spiritual sense in those things, and that without that sense no one knows what they signify? Who persists in denying that the Word is spiritual in its bosom? Would it not be more than material, if those things should be understood according to the sense of the letter, and not according to the spiritual sense? [3] Similar to these things are the following from Ezekiel: Thus said the Lord Jehovah, S ay to the bird of every wing, and to every beast of the field, gather yourselves together and come; gather yourselves together from round about unto my great sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel, that ye may eat flesh and drink blood; ye shall eat the flesh of the mighty, and drink the blood of the princes of the earth, ye shall eat fat to satiety, and drink blood even to drunkenness, of my sacrifice which I sacrifice for you; ye shall be satiated at my table with horse and chariot and every man of war; thus will I give my glory among the nations (Ezek. 39:17–21). Here in like manner by “flesh” is signified the good of the church from the Lord through the Word, and the truth of the church by “blood.” Who does not see that blood would not be given to drink even to drunkenness, and that they would not be satiated at the table of the Lord Jehovah with horse, chariot, the mighty, and with every man of war? Since therefore by “flesh” is signified the good of the church, and by “blood” the truth of the church, it is plainly manifest that by the “flesh and blood” of the Lord in the holy supper the Divine good and the Divine truth from the Lord are signified, the same as by “the bread and wine” spoken of (John 6:51–58). “Flesh” also signifies good in many other passages in the Word, as in these: I will remove the heart of stone from their flesh, and will give them a heart of flesh (Ezek. 11:19; 36:26). My flesh desireth thee in a land of drought (Ps. 63:1). My heart and my flesh shout aloud for the living God (Ps. 84:2). My flesh shall dwell confidently (Ps. 16:9)."

That by “the beast” are signified those who are in the religious persuasion of faith alone, may be seen above (n. 567, 576, 577, 594, 598, 601). That it is only they who are interiorly evil, and have professed that religious persuasion, will be seen below. By “the kings of the earth” are signified those who are in the falsities of that religious persuasion more than the rest, thus the leaders; for by “the kings of the earth” are signified those who are in the truths of the church from the Word, and in the opposite sense those who are in falsities (n. 20, 483, 704, 720, 737, 740); here those who are in falsities.

That by “the beast out of the sea” are meant the laity and the common people who are in the religious persuasion concerning faith alone, and that by “the beast out of the earth” are meant the clergy and the learned who are in that religious persuasion, may be seen from the explanations of that chapter. That “the false prophet” here is “the beast out of the earth,” which is treated of in that chapter (verses 11–18) is plainly manifest; because it is here said of “the false prophet” that it is “he that did signs before the other beast, with which he seduced them that receive the mark of the beast, and that adore his image”; for similar things are said of the beast out of the earth (chap. 13); namely, that: He did great signs before the beast out of the sea, and seduced them that dwell upon the earth, that they should adore his image, and receive his mark upon the right hand and upon the forehead (Rev. 13:12–17): from which it is manifest that the clergy and the learned are here signified by “the false prophet,” who have confirmed themselves in the religious persuasion concerning faith alone, and have seduced the laity and the common people. They are called the false prophet, because by “a prophet” those are signified who teach and preach falsities by perverting the truths of the Word (n. 8, 701).

That “fire” signifies love both in the good and the evil sense may be seen (n. 468, 494, 599); here the love of falsity, because it is said “a lake of fire.” By “brimstone” is signified the lust of evil and thence of falsity (n. 452). The like is said of “the dragon” and of these two in the following chapter, in these words: The devil (that is, the dragon), who seduced them, was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are; and they shall be tormented day and night for ages of ages (Rev. 20:10).

It is their love of falsity, together with the lusts of evil, that makes the appearance of such a lake. That appearance is from correspondence. [3] That by “a lake” is signified where there is truth in abundance, and thence in the opposite sense where there is falsity in abundance, may be evident from the Word; where there is truth in abundance, from these passages: From the wilderness shall waters break forth and rivers in the plain of the wilderness, and the dry place shall become a lake (Isa. 35:6–7). I will make the wilderness a lake of waters, and the dry land springs of waters (Isa. 41:18; Ps. 107:33, 35). I will make the rivers islands, and I will dry up the lakes (Isa. 42:15).

By “the sword of him that sat upon the horse, that proceeded out of his mouth,” the truths of the Word fighting against the falsities of evil are signified. For by “sword,” “long sword,” and “saber” is signified truth fighting against falsity and falsity fighting against truth (n. 52).

That by useless and injurious “birds,” especially the unclean and rapacious, which feed on carrion, are signified falsities which are of love, may be seen above (n. 757). By “flesh” are here signified the evils of the lusts which are of man’s proprium (n. 748). By “being satiated with them” is signified to be as it were nourished by them, and to draw them in with delight; for the infernal genii, who are in similar lusts of evil, eagerly draw in and fill their nostrils, and thence their life, from the lusts exhaled from the thoughts and respiration of such; wherefore they also live and dwell together. 838. Let everyone therefore beware of that heresy, that man is justified by faith without the works of the law; for he who is in it, and does not fully recede from it before the end of life draws near, is consociated after death with infernal genii; for they are the goats of whom the Lord says: Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels (Matt. 25:41–42)."

[2] And the angels answered, “They are from the place which is called Armageddon (Rev. 16:16), where they have been gathered together to the number of some thousands, to fight against those who are of the Lord’s new church, which is called the new Jerusalem. They spoke in that place concerning the church and religion; and yet there was not anything of the church with them, because there was not any spiritual truth; nor anything of religion, because there was not any spiritual good. They spoke there on both subjects with the mouth and with the lips, but for the reason that by means of them they might have dominion. They learned in their youth to confirm faith alone, the trinity of God, and the duality of Christ; and when they were promoted to more eminent offices in the church, they retained those things for some time; but as they then began to think no more about God and heaven, but about themselves and the world, and thus not about eternal happiness and felicity, but about temporal eminence and opulence, they rejected the doctrinals acquired in their youth from the interiors of the rational mind, which communicate with heaven, and hence are in the light of heaven, into the exteriors of the rational mind, which communicate with the world, and hence are only in the light of the world; and at length they thrust them down into the sensual natural; whence the doctrinals of the church have become with them things of the mouth only, and are no longer of the thought from reason, and still less of the affection from love; and because they have made themselves such, they do not admit any genuine"

In like manner, when they hear anything about living water, which is the genuine truth of the Word, and this enters through the ears, they are violently heated and inflamed, and reject it as a thing that would burst their heads. [3] “These are they who appeared to you like apes riding, with the body turned round, upon red and black horses, with the reins around their necks; since they who do not love the truth and the good of the church from the Word, will not look at the forward parts of any horse, but at his hinder parts; for ‘a horse’ signifies the understanding of the Word; ‘a red horse’ the understanding of the Word destroyed as to good, and ‘a black horse’ the understanding of the Word destroyed as to truth. The reason why they cried out to fight against those riding upon the white horses is that ‘a white horse’ signifies the understanding of the Word as to truth and good. They were seen to pull back the horses by their necks, because they feared the combat, lest the truth of the Word should come to many, and so into the light. This is the interpretation.” [4] The angels said further, “We are from the society in heaven which is called Michael, and were commanded by the Lord to descend into the place called Armageddon, whence the company of horsemen was seen by you to burst forth. By ‘Armageddon,’ with us in heaven is signified the state and purpose of fighting from falsified truths, arising from the love of command and supereminence; and because we perceive with you the desire of knowing about the combat there, we will tell about it. After our descent from heaven, we approached the place called Armageddon, and saw there some thousands gathered together. Nevertheless we did not enter into that assembly; but there were two houses on the southern side of that place, where there were boys with their masters.

The life in their eyes was from the perception of truth, and the zeal in their discourse from the affection of truth; on which account also caps had been given them from heaven, the borders of which were ornamented with bands of golden threads interwoven with pearls; and garments were also given, variegated with white and blue colors. We asked them whether they looked into the neighboring place, which is called Armageddon. They said that they did so through a window under the roof of the house, and that they saw there a congregation, but under various figures, now as tall men, and now not as men, but as statues and carved idols, and an assembly around them bending the knees.

Let us send some from our assembly to cast them out.’ And they sent, and when they came, they said to us, ‘Why have you entered into those houses? Whence are you? We command you by authority to depart.’ “But we answered, ‘You cannot command that by authority. You are, indeed, in your own eyes, like Anakim, and they who are here like dwarfs. But still you have no power and right here, unless perchance by cunning from your three places of diversion here, which, however, will not avail. Wherefore take back word to your companions, that we were sent hither from heaven, to ascertain whether there is any religion with you, or not; and if not, that you should be cast out of this place. Wherefore propose to them this, in which is the very essential of the church, and thence of religion, how they understand these words in the Lord’s prayer: “Our Father who art in the heavens, hallowed be thy name; thy kingdom come; thy will be done as in heaven so also upon the earth.”’ On hearing"

They also went out of that place, and entered a grove near the two houses in which these boys were with their masters; where was a level place elevated like a gymnasium. And they took hold of each other’s hands, and entered into the gymnasium, where we were, and were waiting for them. “There were there sods cut from the ground like hillocks; upon them then they reclined; for they said among themselves, ‘Let us not stand before them, but sit.’ And then one of them, who could make himself appear like an angel of light, on whom it had been enjoined by the rest to speak with us, said, ‘You have proposed to us to open our mind concerning the first words in the Lord’s Prayer, how we understand them. I say to you, therefore, that we understand them thus; that we must pray to God the Father; and because Christ is our savior, and we are saved by his merit, that we must pray to God the Father from faith in his merit.’ [6] “But we then said to them, ‘We are from the society of heaven which is called Michael, and we were sent to visit and inquire, whether you that are gathered together in this place have any religion or not; and we cannot know this otherwise than by questioning concerning God; for the idea of God enters into the whole of religion, and by it conjunction is effected, and by conjunction salvation. We in heaven read that prayer daily, like men on earth; and we do not then think of God the Father, because he is invisible; but we think of him in his Divine human, because in this he is visible; and in this he is called by you Christ, but by us the Lord; and thus to us the Lord is the Father in heaven."

How then can the man of the church approach God the Father, except through him in whose body he is?

And I saw an angel coming down from heaven, having the key of the abyss, and a great chain in his hand signifies the Lord’s operation into lower things, from his Divine power of shutting and opening, and of binding and loosing. By “an angel coming down from heaven,” is meant the Lord (see n. 5, 170, 344, 465, 657, 718); also the Lord’s operation (n. 415, 631, 633, 649); here into lower things, because it is said “coming down”; by having “the key of the abyss” is signified the Divine power of opening and shutting hell (see n. 62, 174); and “by having a great chain in his hand,” is signified the endeavor and thence the act of binding and loosing. Hence it follows that there was not any key nor a chain in the Lord’s hand; but it was so seen by John that it might be a representative of the Lord’s Divine power; the opening and shutting of hell is also treated of two or three times in this chapter. 841. Verse 2. And he laid hold on the dragon, the old serpent, which is the devil, and satan signifies that they were withheld who were meant by “the dragon,” who, because they think sensually and not spiritually on things of faith, are called “the old serpent,” and because they are in evils as to life, are called “the devil,” and because they are in falsities as to doctrine, are called “satan.” Who they are who are meant by “the dragon,” may be seen above (n. 537). The reason why both here and there he is called “the old serpent, the devil, and satan,” is because “a serpent” signifies those who think sensually and not spiritually (n. 455, 550); “the devil” signifies those who are in evils as to life; and “satan” those who are in falsities as to doctrine (n. 97, 550). For all those who do not approach the Lord immediately think sensually of things relating to the church, and cannot think spiritually, for the Lord is the light itself (n. 796, 799). Wherefore they who do not immediately approach the Lord cannot think from spiritual light, which is the light of heaven, but from natural light separated from spiritual light, which is to think sensually; hence it is that they are called “the old serpent.” They who do not immediately approach the Lord, nor shun evils as sins, remain in sins, thence it is that the"

And bound him a thousand years signifies that they who are here meant by “the dragon,” were withdrawn and torn away from the rest in the world of spirits, that for some time there might be no communication with them. That by “binding” is here signified to withdraw and tear them away from the rest in the world of spirits, in order to prevent communication with them, will be seen in the next article. The reason why by “a thousand years” are not meant a thousand years, but for a while or for some time, is because “a thousand,” without other numbers added to it, in the spiritual world has that signification; he who believes that “a thousand years” signify a thousand years does not know that all numbers in the Word signify things, and thus may be misled, especially in Revelation, with respect to the sense of the things, where numbers are read, as where the numbers, 5, 7, 10, 12, 144, 666, 1200, 1600, 12,000, 144,000, and many others occur; in which latter numbers “a thousand” only signifies a certain adjunct, and when a thousand is used to designate times, it signifies somewhat more; but when it is used by itself, as here, it signifies for a while or for some time; that this is so has been told me from heaven, where in the Word which is there no number is read, but instead of a number the thing, and instead of a “thousand” for a while; they are surprised there that when the men of the church have seen in Revelation so many numbers, which cannot but signify things, they should still adhere to the conjectures of the chiliasts and millennialists, by which their minds are impressed with vain things concerning the last state of the church. 843. Verse 3. And cast him into the abyss, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should not seduce the nations anymore signifies that the Lord entirely removed those who were in faith alone, and took away all communication between them and the rest, lest they should inspire into those who were to be taken up into heaven, anything of their heresy. By “the dragon” are here meant those who are in falsities of faith, as above (n. 842). It is said of the dragon that “he was taken,” “bound,” “cast into the abyss,”"

[2] The reason why the dragon was entirely removed for a time was that they might be taken up from the lower earth who had been concealed by the Lord, and who are treated of (verses 4–6), lest when they were taken up, they should be seduced by the dragonists; therefore it is also said, “that he should not seduce the nations anymore,” by which is signified that he might not inspire into them anything of his heresy. The reason why this was done in the world of spirits, which is midway between heaven and hell, is because there the evil have communication with the good, and the good are prepared in that world for heaven, and the evil for hell, and there the good are proved by having some consociation with the evil, and they are explored and tried as to their quality and constancy. By “the nations” which he should not seduce, are meant the good; that by “nations” are meant they who are good as to life, and, in the opposite sense, the evil, may be seen above (n. 483). From these things it may appear, that by “he cast them into the abyss, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him” is signified that the Lord entirely removed those who were in the falsities of faith, and took away all communication between them and the rest, lest they should inspire anything of their heresy into those who were to be elevated into heaven. 844.

By “until a thousand years were finished” signifies for a while or for some time. (This is because by “a thousand years” is not signified a thousand years but a little while or some time, as above, n. 842.) “He must be loosed a little, “signifies that after that they who are here meant by “the dragon,” as above, are to be released from their confinement, and that then a communication is to be opened between them and the rest; that this is what is signified is evident from what has been said above, thus from the series of things, and from their connection with what follows, in the spiritual sense. What now follows (verses 4–6) treats of those who were taken up by the Lord into heaven, on whose account the dragon was removed and shut up. 845. Verse 4. And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them signifies that the truths of the Word, according to which all are judged, were opened, and that then they were taken up from the lower earth, who had been concealed by the Lord, lest they should be seduced by the dragon and his beasts. The reason why this is the signification of these words is because by “the thrones” upon which they sat are not signified thrones, but judgment according to the truths of the Word; that by “the thrones” seen in heaven is represented judgment may be seen above (n. 229). That nothing else is signified by “the thrones,” upon which the twenty-four elders sat, and upon which the twelve apostles are to sit, and that all are judged according to the truths of the Word, may also be seen above (n. 233); from which it is plain, that by “judgment was given unto them” is signified that judgment was given to the truths of the Word. [2] The reason why they are meant who were taken up by the Lord from the lower earth into heaven, and who in the meanwhile had been concealed there lest they should be seduced by the dragon and his beasts is because this is said of “the souls which had been beheaded,” and of “the dead,” afterwards mentioned, not that they were dead to themselves, but to others.

There are many such places, and there they live cheerfully with one another, and worship the Lord, nor do they know anything about hell. They who are there are at times elevated by the Lord into heaven after the last judgment, and when they are elevated those who are meant by the dragon are removed. It has been frequently granted me to see them taken up and consociated with the angels in heaven. This is what is meant in the Word by “the graves were opened,” and “the dead were raised up.” 846. And the souls of them that were beheaded for the testimony of Jesus and for the Word of God signifies that they were rejected by those who are in falsities from their own intelligence, because they worshiped the Lord, and lived according to the truths of his Word. By “the souls of them that were beheaded (smitten with the axe), for the testimony of Jesus and for the Word of God” are meant men after death, who are then called spirits, or men clothed with a spiritual body, who were concealed by the Lord in the lower earth, until the evil were removed by the last judgment. They are said “to be beheaded,” because they were rejected by those who were in falsities from their own intelligence, all of whom are in evils and thence in falsities, or in falsities and by them in evils, and yet in externals are in Divine worship. That this kind of falsity is signified by an axe will be seen in the next article. By “the testimony of Jesus and the Word of God” is signified the acknowledgment of the Lord’s Divine in his human, like as by these passages above: John testified of the Word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ (Rev. 1:2). Michael and his angels overcame the dragon by the blood of the lamb and by the Word of their testimony (Rev. 12:11). The dragon went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ (Rev. 12:17).

These souls are the same as are spoken of above in these words: I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the Word of God and for the testimony which they held; and they cried with a great voice, saying, How long, O Lord, who art holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell upon the earth? And white robes were given unto every one of them, and it was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little time, until their fellow servants and their brethren, who should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled (Rev. 6:9–11); which may be seen explained (n. 325–329). 847. In many parts in the Word it is said that some “were slain,” “thrust through,” and “dead,” and yet it is not meant that they were slain, thrust through, and dead, but that they were rejected by those who were in evils and falsities (see n. 59, 325, 589). The like is signified by “the dead” in the following verse, where it is said that “the rest of the dead lived not again, until the thousand years were finished,” from which it is plain, that by those who are said “to have been beheaded” are signified that they were rejected by those who were in falsities from their own intelligence. That by “an axe” is signified falsity from their own intelligence, appears from the following passages: The statutes of the nations are vanity, if one cutteth wood out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman, with the axe (Jer. 10:3). The voice of Egypt shall go like a serpent; they shall come with axes like hewers of wood (Jer. 46:22). He is known as one lifting up axes in the thicket of trees. And now they break down the carved work thereof with axe and hammers; they have profaned the habitation of thy name to the earth (Ps. 74:5–7). When thou shalt besiege a city, thou shalt not destroy the tree thereof by forcing an axe against it (Deut. 20:19)."

On account of this signification of “iron” and of “an axe,” it was commanded that: If an altar was built of stone, it should be built of whole stones, and that iron should not be moved upon the stones, lest it be profaned (Exod. 20:25; Deut. 27:5). Therefore of the temple of Jerusalem it is said: The house itself was built of whole stone; neither hammers nor axe, nor any instrument of iron, were heard in the house while it was building (1 Kings 6:7); and, on the contrary, when graven images are treated of, by which is signified falsity from their own intelligence, these things are said: That he maketh it with iron, with tongs, or with the axe and hammers (Isa. 44:12).

This is said of those who during their life in the world worshiped the Lord, and lived according to his commandments in the Word, and after death were guarded lest they should be seduced by the dragonists, thus who had been already for some time conjoined with the Lord and consociated as to their interiors with the angels of heaven. That “to reign with the Lord” does not mean to reign with him, but to be in his kingdom by conjunction with him may be seen above (n. 284). For the Lord alone reigns, and everyone in heaven, who is in any function, performs his office in his society, as in the world, but under the auspices of the Lord; they act indeed as of themselves, but because they regard uses in the first place, they act from the Lord, from whom is all use. 850. Verse 5. And the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished signifies that besides these now spoken of, none were taken up into heaven, till after the dragon was loosed, when their quality was proved and explored. By “the rest of the dead” are signified they who are also rejected by those who are in faith alone, because they worshiped the Lord, and lived according to his commandments, but whose quality was not yet proved and explored. That here by “the dead” these are signified, may be seen above (n. 847). For all after their departure out of the world come first into the world of spirits, which is midway between heaven and hell, and are there proved and explored, and thus prepared, the evil for hell, and the good for heaven. It is said of these that they lived not again, that is, they were not yet so conjoined with the Lord, and consociated with the angels of heaven, as the former.

In verse 4 are these things: “I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the testimony of Jesus and for the Word of God, and who had not adored the beast nor his image, nor had received his mark upon their forehead and upon their hand; and they lived and reigned with Christ.” That by “the souls of them that were beheaded for the testimony of Jesus and for the Word of God” are signified such as were rejected by those who are in falsities from their own intelligence because they worshiped the Lord, and lived according to his commandments in the Word, may be seen above (n. 846–847). That by “they adored not the beast nor his image, neither received his mark upon their forehead and upon their hand,” is signified that they rejected the heresy of faith alone, may be seen above (n. 848); and that by “they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years,” is signified that they have conjunction with the Lord and consociation with the angels of heaven, may be seen above (n. 849). These things therefore are what are involved in these words, “This is the first resurrection.” By “resurrection” is signified salvation and life eternal, and by “the first” is not meant the first resurrection, but the very and primary of resurrection, thus salvation and life eternal; for there is only one resurrection to life, a second is not given; therefore a second resurrection is nowhere mentioned; for they who are once conjoined with the Lord, are conjoined with him forever; and this in heaven, for the Lord says: I am the resurrection and the life; he that believeth in me, though he were dead, shall live; whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall not die to eternity (John 11:25, 26). That this is what is meant by “the first resurrection” appears also from the following verse. 852. Verse 6. Happy and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection signifies that they who come into heaven, have the felicity of life eternal, and enlightenment by conjunction with the Lord. He is called “happy” who has the felicity of life eternal (n. 639); and he is called “holy” who has enlightenment in Divine"

By “the first resurrection” is signified elevation into heaven by the Lord, and thus salvation, as above (n. 851). Hence it is evident, that by “Happy and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection” is signified that they who come into heaven have the felicity of life eternal, and enlightenment by conjunction with the Lord. 853. Upon these the second death hath no power signifies that they are not condemned. By “the second death” nothing else is signified but spiritual death, which is damnation; for the first death is natural death, which is the death of the body; but the second death is spiritual death, which is the death of the soul, and that this is damnation is known. And since the second death is damnation, and the first death is the decease, and this latter death is not spiritual, therefore the first death is nowhere mentioned in Revelation, but the second death spoken of again in this chapter, verse 14; also in the following (21:8), and likewise before (2:11). He who does not observe this, may readily believe that there are two spiritual deaths, because it is said “the second death,” when nevertheless there is only one spiritual death, which is here meant by “the second death”; and in like manner that there are two resurrections, because it is said “the first resurrection,” when yet there is only one resurrection, wherefore neither is there any second resurrection mentioned, see above (n. 851). Hence it is evident that by “On these the second death hath no power,” is signified that they are not condemned. 854. But they shall be priests of God and of Christ signifies because they are kept by the Lord in the good of love and thence in the truths of wisdom.

And it may be clearly seen that the Lord will not make men kings and priests, but that he will make them angels who are in the truths of wisdom, and in the good of love from him. That by “kings” are meant they who are in the truths of wisdom from the Lord, and that the Lord is called “king” from the Divine truth, may be seen above (n. 20, 483, 664, 830). The reason why by “priests” are meant those who are in the good of love from the Lord is because the Lord is the Divine love and the Divine wisdom, or what is the same, the Divine good and the Divine truth; and the Lord from the Divine love or the Divine good is called “priest,” and from the Divine wisdom or the Divine truth is called “king.” Hence it is that there are two kingdoms, into which the heavens are distinguished, the celestial and the spiritual; and the celestial kingdom is called the Lord’s priestly kingdom, for the angels there are recipients of the Divine love or the Divine good from the Lord, and the spiritual kingdom is called the Lord’s royal kingdom, for the angels there are the recipients of the Divine wisdom or the Divine truth from the Lord; but more may be seen concerning these two kingdoms above (n. 647, 725). [2] It is said that they are recipients of the Divine good and the Divine truth from the Lord; but it is to be known that they are perpetually receiving them, for the Divine good and the Divine truth cannot be appropriated by any angel or man, so as to be his own, but only that they may appear to be his, because they are Divine; wherefore no angel or man can produce from himself anything good or true, which in itself is good and true; from which it is evident that they are kept in good and truth by the Lord, and this continually; for which reason, if anyone comes into heaven, and thinks that good and truth are appropriated to him as his own, he is immediately let down from heaven and instructed.

[3] That by priests in the Word are meant such as are in the good of love from the Lord may appear from many passages therein, but as they are adduced in Arcana Coelestia, published at London, I will only cite therefrom the following summary: that priests represented the Lord as to the Divine good (n. 2015, 6148); that the priesthood was a representative of the Lord as to the work of salvation, because this was from the Divine good of his Divine love (n. 9809); that the priesthood of Aaron, of his sons, and of the Levites was a representative of the Lord’s work of salvation in successive order (n. 10,017); that therefore by “priests” and by “the priesthood” is signified the good of love from the Lord (n. 9806, 9809); that by the two names “Jesus” and “Christ,” is signified as well the priesthood as the royalty of the Lord (n. 3004–3005, 3009); that priests administer ecclesiastical affairs, and kings civil affairs (n. 10,793); that priests are to teach truths, and by these lead to good, and thus to the Lord (n. 10,794); that they are not to claim power to themselves over the souls of men (n. 10,795); that priests ought to have dignity on account of holy things, but that they ought not to attribute the dignity to themselves, but to the Lord, from whom alone are holy things, because the priesthood is not in the person, but is adjoined to the person (n. 10,796–10,797); that priests who do not acknowledge the Lord have in the Word a contrary signification (n. 3670). 855. And shall reign with him a thousand years signifies that they were already in heaven, when the rest, who did not yet live again, that is, receive heavenly life, were in the world of spirits. “To reign with Christ” does not signify to reign with him, but to be in his kingdom, or in heaven, see above (n. 284, 289). By “a thousand years” is not meant a thousand years, but it signifies some time, as above (n. 842); that “a thousand years” signifies nothing else but that space of time which intervened between the shutting up of the dragon in the abyss and his release is evident because it is said that he was cast into the abyss, shut up, and a seal set upon him for a thousand years, and then that he was loosed (verses 3, 7); this same"

But these things cannot be comprehended by those who do not know that by numbers, in Revelation, are not meant numbers, but things. I can assert that the angels do not understand any number naturally, as men do, but spiritually; yea, that they do not know what a thousand years are, except that it is some interval of time, small or great, which cannot be otherwise expressed than by some time. 856. Verse 7. And when the thousand years are finished, satan shall be loosed out of his prison signifies that after they who had before been concealed and guarded in the lower earth, were taken up by the Lord into heaven, and the new Christian heaven increased by them, all who had confirmed themselves in the falsities of faith were let loose. “When the thousand years are finished” signifies after they were taken up by the Lord into heaven who had hitherto been concealed and guarded in the lower earth. The reason why “when the thousand years are finished” has this signification is because the salvation of those who worshiped the Lord and who lived according to his commandments is alone treated of in verses 4–6, which precede, and this interval of time is meant by “a thousand years.” It is not said, indeed, that they were taken up from the lower earth, but yet it is evident from chapter 6:9–11, where they were seen “under the altar,” and “under the altar” means in the lower earth; wherefore also they are here called “priests of God and of Christ” (verse 6, see above n. 854). Neither is it here said that the new Christian heaven was increased by them, though this appears evidently from chapter 14, which treats of the new Christian heaven, as may be seen from the explanations there given (especially in n. 612–613, 626, 631, 647, 659, 661). The reason why by “satan was loosed out of his prison” is signified that they who had confirmed themselves in faith alone as to doctrine were to be let loose is because “the dragon” is here called “satan” and not at the same time “devil,” as above (verse 2); and by “the dragon” as “the devil” are meant those who were in evils of life, and by “the dragon” as “satan” are meant those who were in the falsities"

[2] In the thirty-ninth chapter of the same prophet are these things: of those who are in the sense of the letter of the Word alone and in external worship, that they will come into the church, which is “Gog,” but that they will perish (verses 1–6); that this will come to pass when the Lord comes and establishes the church (verses 7–8); that this church will then disperse all their evils and falsities (verses 9, 10); that it will altogether destroy them (verses 11–16); that the new church to be established by the Lord will be informed in truths and goods of every kind, and be imbued with goods of every kind (verses 17–21); and that the former church will be destroyed on account of evils and falsities (verses 23, 24); that then the church will be collected by the Lord from all nations (verses 25–29).

These are they who frequent temples on sabbaths and festivals, and then sing psalms and pray, hearken to preachings, and then attend to the eloquence, and little or nothing to the substance, and are somewhat moved by prayers uttered with affection, as that they are sinners, but never reflect upon themselves and their life; who also go to the sacrament of the supper yearly; pour out prayers morning and evening, and also pray at dinners and suppers and sometimes discourse about God, heaven, and eternal life, and then also they know how to repeat some passages from the Word, and simulate Christians, although they are not; for after they have done these things, they"

That this is the signification of these words, no one can perceive except by the spiritual sense of the Word, for it could never enter into anyone’s thought, that by “the breadth of the earth” is signified the truth of the church, and that by “the camp of the saints” are signified all things of the new church, both its truths and goods, and that by “the city” is signified its doctrine. Wherefore, lest the mind should remain in doubt, it is necessary to demonstrate what “the breadth” and what “the camp of the saints” signify in the spiritual sense, from which it may afterwards be seen that such is the sense of these words. [2] The reason why the “breadth of the earth” signifies the truth of the church is because in the spiritual world there are four quarters, east, west, south, and north, and the east and west constitute its length, and the south and north its breadth; and because they dwell in the east and west who are in the good of love, and thence by “east” and “west” is signified good, therefore the same is meant by “length”; and because they dwell in the south and north who are in the truths of wisdom, and thence by “south” and “north” is signified truth, therefore the same is meant by “breadth”; but on this more may be seen in Heaven and Hell, published at London in 1758 (n. 141–153). That by “breadth” is signified truth, may appear from these passages in the Word: O Jehovah, thou hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy; thou hast made my feet to stand in a broad place (Ps. 31:8). I called upon Jah in straitness, he answered me in a broad place (Ps. 118:5) Jehovah led me forth also into a broad place, he delivered me (Ps. 18:19). I raise up the Chaldeans, a nation bitter and swift, that walketh in the breadths of the earth (Hab. 1:6). Ashur shall pass through Judah, he shall overflow and go over, and the stretching out of his wings is the fullness of the breadth (Isa. 8:8)."

For when by “the new Jerusalem” is meant the new church, by “the breadth and length of it” breadth and length cannot be signified, but its truth and good; for these are the things of the church, as also in Zechariah: I said to the angel, Whither goest thou?

It was said that by “they encompassed the camp of the saints and the beloved city” is signified that they would endeavor to destroy all things of the new church, both its truths and its goods, and the doctrine itself concerning the Lord and concerning life, as is said in the preceding article. The reason why these are signified is because by “the camp of the saints” are signified all the truths and goods of the church which is the new Jerusalem.

I will encamp about my house because of the army (Zech. 9:8). God hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee, because God hath rejected them (Ps. 53:5). The angel of Jehovah encampeth about them that fear him, and delivereth them (Ps. 34:7). The angels of God met Jacob, and Jacob said, This is God’s camp, therefore he called the name of that place Mahanaim (the two camps) (Gen. 32:2). Besides other places, as Isa. 29:3; Ezek. 1:24; Ps. 27:3. That by “an army” in the Word are signified the truths and goods of the church, also its falsities and evils, may be seen (n. 447, 826, 833); the same is also signified by “camps.” [2] Since by the sons of Israel and their twelve tribes is signified the church as to all its truths and goods (n. 349–350), they were therefore called “the army of Jehovah” (Exod. 7:4; 12:41, 51); and when they halted and were assembled, they were called “the camp” (as in Lev. 4:12; 8:17; 13:46; 14:8; 16:26, 28; 24:14, 23; Num. 1–3, 4:5 seq.; 5:2–4; 9:17 to the end; 10:2–8; 11:31–32; 12:14, 15; 21:10–25; 33:1–49; Deut. 23:9–14; Amos 4:10). From these things it is plain, that by “they encompassed the camp of the saints and the beloved city” is signified that they would endeavor to destroy all the truths and goods of the new church which is the new Jerusalem, and also its doctrine concerning the Lord and concerning life. The like is signified by this passage in Luke: When ye shall see Jerusalem encompassed by armies, then know that the devastation is near; at length Jerusalem shall be trodden down by the nations until the times of the nations shall be fulfilled (Luke 21:20, 24). This is concerning the consummation of the age, which is the last time of the church; by “Jerusalem” is here also signified the church.

And fire came down from God out of heaven, and consumed them signifies that they perished by the lusts of infernal love. By “fire coming down out of heaven which consumed them” is signified the lusts of evils, or of infernal love (as above, n. 494, 748), because they who are in external worship separated from internal worship, are in all kinds of evils and lusts, because with them evils are not removed by any actual repentance (n. 859). It is said that “fire came down from God out of heaven”; this was done in ancient times, when all things of the church were represented before their eyes, consequently when churches were representative; but at this day, when representatives have ceased, the like is said, and the signification is the same as formerly when the thing was represented. That fire came down out of heaven upon those who profaned things holy, may be seen above (n. 494, 748). The same is said of “Gog and Magog” in Ezekiel: I will cause it to rain upon Gog, and upon his wings, and upon many people that are with him, fire and brimstone (Ezek. 38:22). I will send fire upon Magog (Ezek. 39:6). 864. Verse 10.

By “the devil that seduced them” is meant the dragon, as is evident from what goes before, and by “the dragon” are meant in general those who are in evils as to life, and in falsities as to doctrine (n. 841).

And because it is said that “they were cast into the lake of fire and brimstone,” by which is signified where the loves of falsity and the lusts of evil are (n. 835), these are what they will be infested by interiorly; for everyone in hell is tormented by his own love and its lusts, for these make the life of everyone there, and it is the life which is tormented; wherefore there are degrees of torment there according to the degrees of the love of evil and thence of falsity. 865.

Before these things are explained in their order according to the letter, something must be premised concerning the universal judgment here treated of. From the time when the Lord was in the world, when he executed the last judgment in person, it was permitted that they who were in civil and moral good, although in no spiritual good, whence in externals they appeared like Christians, but in internals were devils, should continue longer than the rest in the world of spirits, which is midway between heaven and hell; and at length they were allowed to make there for themselves fixed habitations, and also by the abuse of correspondences, and by fantasies, to form to themselves as it were heavens, which also they did form in great abundance.

But more concerning this universal judgment may be seen in the little work Last Judgment, published at London in the year 1758, and in Continuation of the Last Judgment, published at Amsterdam in the year 1763. [2] Now to the explanation: By “the great white throne, and him who sat upon it” is signified the universal judgment executed by the Lord; by “the throne” is signified heaven, and likewise judgment (n. 229); by “him who sat upon the throne” is meant the Lord (n. 808 at the end). The reason why the throne appeared “white” is because judgment was executed from Divine truths, for “white” is predicated of truths (n. 167, 379). The reason why the throne appeared “great” is because judgment was likewise executed from Divine good, for “great” is predicated of good (n. 656, 663). “From whose face the earth and the heaven fled away” signifies that those heavens, which they had made for themselves, as described above, together with their earths, were dissipated; for there are earths in the spiritual world as well as in the natural world, as may be seen (n. 260, 331); but the earths, like all other things there, are from a spiritual origin. And “there was not found a place for them” signifies that those heavens with their earths were so totally dissipated, that nothing of them appeared anymore. Hence it is evident that by “I saw a great white throne, and him who sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was not found a place for them” is signified the universal judgment executed by the Lord upon all the former3 heavens that were inhabited by such as were in civil and moral good, but in no spiritual good, thus who simulated Christians in externals, but in internals were devils; which heavens, together with their earth, were totally dissipated, so that nothing of them appeared anymore."

By “the dead” are signified all who had departed from the earth, or who were dead as to the body, concerning whom more will be said below; by “small and great” are signified of every condition and quality (as at n. 604); by “standing before God,” that is, before him who sat upon the throne, is signified to be present and gathered together to judgment. By “the dead” in the Word the same thing is signified as by deaths, and “deaths” signify various things; for “death” not only signifies the extinction of natural life or decease, but also the extinction of spiritual life, which is damnation; by “death” is also signified the extinction of the loves of the body or the lusts of the flesh, after which there is a renewal of life; in like manner by “death” is signified resurrection, because man rises again immediately after death; by “death” is also signified neglect, nonacknowledgment, and rejection by the world, but in the most general sense by “death” the same is signified as by “the devil,” wherefore also the devil is called “death,” and by “the devil” is meant hell where they are who are called devils, hence also by “death” the evil of the will is meant which causes man to be a devil. “Death” is used in this last sense in the next verse, where it is said that “death and hell gave up their dead,” and that “they were cast into the lake of fire.” From these things it may appear who are meant by “the dead” in the variety of senses; here are signified all those who had departed out of the world, or who had died from the earth, and were then in the world of spirits. [2] It is said in the world of spirits, because all come into that world immediately after their decease, and are there prepared, the good for heaven, and the evil for hell; and some stay there only a month or a year, and others from ten to thirty years; and they to whom it was granted to make as it were heavens to themselves, several centuries; but at this day not longer than twenty years.

From these considerations it may be seen, how much they are deceived who believe that the last judgment is to take place upon earth, and that then men are to rise again as to their bodies, for all who have lived from the first creation of the world are together in the spiritual world; and all are clothed with a spiritual body, which before the eyes of those who are spiritual appear as men in a similar form, just as they who are in the natural world appear before the eyes of those who are natural. 867.

By “books” are not meant books, but the interiors of the minds of those who are judged, by “the books,” the interiors of the minds of those who are evil, and are judged to death, and by “the book of life” such as are good, and are judged to life. They are called “books,” because in the interiors of the mind of everyone are inscribed all the things that he thought, intended, spoke, and did in the world from the will or the love, and thence from the understanding or faith; all these things are inscribed on the life of everyone, with so much exactness that not one of them is wanting. The quality of all these things appears to the life, when spiritual light, which is wisdom from the Lord, and spiritual heat, which is love from the Lord, flow in through heaven. Spiritual light discloses the thoughts which are of the understanding and faith, and spiritual heat discloses the affections which are of the will and love; and spiritual light together with spiritual heat disclose the intentions and endeavors.

By “the dead” are signified all who died from the earth, and were then in the world of spirits, as above (n. 866). “Out of those things which were written in the books” signifies out of the interiors of everyone’s mind then laid open, as above (n. 867); “according to their works” signifies, according to the internal life of everyone in externals. That this is signified by “works” in the Word, may be seen above (n. 72, 76, 94, 141, 641); to which I will further add, that there are works of the mind and works of the body, both of them at once internal and external. The works of the mind are intentions and endeavors, and the works of the body are words and actions; each of these proceed from the internal life of man, which is of his will or love. Whatsoever does not close in works, either internal which relate to the mind, or external which relate to the body, are not in the life of man, for they inflow from the world of spirits but are not received, therefore they are like images that strike the eyes, or as odors that affect the nostrils, from which a man turns away his face. But more may be seen on this subject in the places cited above, where also some passages are adduced from the Word to prove that man is judged according to his works; to which may be added the following from Paul: In the day of anger and revelation of the just judgment of God; who will render to everyone according to his deeds (Rom. 2:5–6). For we must all be manifested before the judgment seat of Christ, that everyone may receive the things done in the body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or evil (2 Cor. 5:10). 869.

By “the dead” are meant they who had died out of the earth, as above (n. 866, 868). The reason why by “the dead whom the sea gave up” are meant the external men of the church is because no others were judged but those who were in some worship, for all who have spurned the holy things of the church, and have denied God, the Word, and the life after death, were judged immediately after death, and conjoined with those who were in hell, whither they were afterwards cast down. But they who had been external and natural men, and professed with the mouths that there is a God, that there are a heaven and a hell, and in a certain way had acknowledged the Word, these are they who were called together to judgment. Out of these who were from “the sea,” many were saved, for we do not read that all these “were cast into the lake of fire,” as “death and hell” were, but that “if any one of them was not found written in the book of life, he was cast therein” (verse 15). Such of these as were saved are also meant by “the rest of the dead which lived not again until the thousand years were finished” (verse 5).

In other places also mention is made of “death and hell,” as in the following: The son of man said, I have the keys of death and hell (Rev. 1:18). The name of him who sat on the pale horse was Death, and hell followed him (Rev. 6:8). In like manner Hos. 13:14; Ps. 18:4–5; 49:14–15; 116:3. 871. And they were judged everyone according to their works signifies that they were all judged according to their internal life in externals, as appears from the explanation above (n. 868), where are similar words. To which I will add this, that everyone is judged according to the quality of his soul; and the soul of man is his life, for it is the love of his will, and the love of everyone’s will is entirely according to his reception of the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord; and this reception is taught by the doctrine of the church which is from the Word. 872. Verse 14. And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire signifies that the wicked at heart, who in themselves were devils and satans, and yet in externals like men of the church, were cast into hell among those who were in the love of evil, and thence in the love of falsity agreeing with evil. By “death and hell” are signified the wicked at heart, who interiorly in themselves were devils and satans, and yet in externals like men of the church, as above (n. 870). By “the lake of fire” is signified hell, where they are who are in the love of evil, and thus in the love of the falsity agreeing with evil, thus who love evil, and confirm it by reasonings from the natural man, and still more they who confirm it by the sense of the letter of the Word. These cannot interiorly in themselves do otherwise than deny God, for such denial lies concealed in evil of life confirmed by falsities. “A lake” signifies where falsity abounds,"

This is the second death signifies that with these there is damnation itself. That by “the second death” is signified spiritual death, which is damnation, may be seen above (n. 853). This is said, because they who are wicked at heart, and in themselves devils and satans, and yet appear like men of the church, are condemned beyond all others. 874. Verse 15.

That he who does not live according to the Lord’s commandments in the Word is condemned, the Lord teaches in John: And if anyone hear my words and believe not, I judge him not; he hath one that judgeth him, the Word that I have spoken, that shall judge him in the last day (John 12:47–48). And that he who does not believe in the Lord is condemned, also in John: He that believeth on the son hath eternal life, and he that believeth not the son, shall not see life, but the anger of God abideth on him (John 3:36)."

Awaking one morning from sleep, I saw two angels descending out of heaven, one from the southern quarter of heaven and the other from the eastern quarter of heaven, both in chariots to which white horses were harnessed. The chariot in which the angel from the southern quarter of heaven was conveyed, shone like silver, and the chariot in which the angel from the eastern quarter of heaven was conveyed, shone like gold; and the reins which they held in their hands were refulgent as from the flamy light of the dawn. Thus these two angels were seen by me at a distance; but when they came nearer, they did not appear in a chariot, but in their angelic form, which is human. He who came from the eastern quarter of heaven was clad in a bright purple garment, and he who came from the southern quarter of heaven in a garment of hyacinthine blue. When they were below under the heavens, they ran to meet each other, as if they strove which should be first, and mutually embraced and kissed each other. I heard that these two angels, when they lived on earth, had been conjoined in interior friendship; but now one was in the eastern heaven and the other in the southern heaven. In the eastern heaven are they who are in love from the Lord; but in the southern heaven are they who are in wisdom from the Lord. [2] When they had spoken some time about the magnificence of their heavens, this came up in their discourse, whether heaven in its essence is love, or whether it is wisdom. They immediately agreed that one is of the other, but discussed which was the original. The angel who was from the heaven of wisdom asked the other, what love is; to which he replied that “love, originating from the Lord as a sun, is the vital heat of angels and men, thus their life; that the derivations of love are called affections; and that by these are produced perceptions and thus thoughts, whence it follows that wisdom in its origin is love; consequently that thought in its origin is the affection of that love; and it is evident from the derivations viewed in their order, that thought is nothing else but the form of affection; and that this is not known, because the thoughts are in the light, but the affections in heat, and that therefore one reflects upon the thoughts, but not on the affections, in the same manner as takes place with sound and with speech. That thought is nothing"

This may also be made clear by this, that if you take away sound from speech, nothing of speech remains, and, in like manner, if you take away affection from thought, nothing of thought remains. Hence then it is plain that love is the all of wisdom, consequently the essence of the heavens is love, and their existence is wisdom, or what is the same thing, the heavens are from the Divine love, and they exist from the Divine love by the Divine wisdom, wherefore, as was said above, the one is of the other.” [3] There was with me at that time a novitiate spirit, who on hearing this asked whether it is the same with charity and faith, since charity is of affection, and faith is of thought. The angel replied, “It is altogether the same; for faith is nothing else but the form of charity, just as speech is the form of sound;4 faith is also formed by charity as speech is formed by sound; the mode of its formation we also know in heaven, but there is no leisure to explain it here.” “By faith, however,” he added, “I mean spiritual faith, the spirit and life of which is derived solely from charity, for charity is spiritual, and by charity, faith; wherefore faith without charity is a merely natural faith, which is dead, which also conjoins itself with merely natural affection, which is nothing else but lust.” The angels spoke of these things spiritually, and spiritual speech embraces thousands of things which natural speech cannot express, and what is wonderful, which cannot even fall within the ideas of natural thought. Remember this, I pray, and when you come out of natural light into spiritual light, which is done after death, inquire what faith is and what charity is and you will clearly see that faith is charity in form, and therefore that charity is the all of faith, consequently that it is the soul, life, and essence of faith, just as the affection is of thought, and as the sound is of speech; and if you desire it, you will see the formation of faith from charity like the formation of speech from sound, because they correspond. After discoursing together for some time on these and suchlike subjects, the angels departed, and as they retired each to his own heaven,"

[4] After these two angels were gone out of my sight, I saw a certain garden on my right hand, in which were olive trees, vines, fig trees, laurels, and palm trees, planted in order, according to correspondence. I looked into the garden, and saw angels and spirits walking and conversing together among the trees; and then a certain angelic spirit observed me. They are called angelic spirits who in the world of spirits are prepared for heaven and afterwards become angels. That spirit came out of the garden towards me, and said, “Will you come with me into our paradise? You shall hear and see wonderful things.” And I went with him, and then he said to me, “Those whom you see (for there were many) are all in the affection of truth, and thence in the light of wisdom. Here also is a building which we call the temple of wisdom; but no one sees it who believes himself very wise, much less he who believes himself wise enough, and still less he who believes himself wise from himself; the reason is because such persons are not in the reception of the light of heaven from the affection of genuine wisdom. Genuine wisdom consists in a man’s seeing from the light of heaven, that the things which he knows, understands, and is wise in, are so little respectively to what he does not know, understand, and is wise in, as a drop to the ocean, consequently scarcely anything. Everyone who is in this paradisal garden, and acknowledges in himself from perception and sight that his own wisdom is so little comparatively, sees that temple of wisdom, for interior light enables him to see it, but not exterior light without it.” [5] And because I had often thought this, both from science, and then from perception, and lastly from seeing it from interior light, and had acknowledged that man had so little wisdom, behold, it was given me to see that temple. As to form it was wonderful. It was elevated above the ground, quadrangular, with walls of crystal, its roof of translucent jasper elegantly arched; the foundation consisted of precious stones of various kinds.

And I then asked whether it was allowed to enter; and it was said that it was allowed; therefore I ascended, and when I entered, I saw, as it were, cherubs flying beneath the roof, and presently vanishing out of sight; the floor upon which we walked was of cedar, and the whole temple, from the translucence of its roof and walls, seemed in the form of light. [6] The angelic spirit entered with me, to whom I related what I heard from the two angels concerning love and wisdom, as also concerning charity and faith. And he then said, “Did they not speak of a third also?” I said, “What third?” he replied, “It is use; love and wisdom without use are not anything; they are only ideal entities; nor do they become real before they are in use; for love, wisdom, and use, are three things which cannot be separated. If they are separated, neither is anything. Love is not anything without wisdom, but in wisdom it is formed for something. This something for which it is formed is use. Therefore, when love through wisdom is in use, it is then something; yea, it then first exists. They are altogether as the end, the cause, and the effect. The end is not anything, unless through the cause it is in the effect. If one of the three is loosed, the whole is loosed, and becomes as nothing. It is similar with charity, faith, and works. [7] “Charity without faith is not anything; nor faith without charity; nor charity and faith without works; but in works they become something, of a quality according to the use of the works. It is similar with affection, thought, and operation; and it is similar with will, understanding, and action. That it is so may be seen clearly in this temple, because the light in which we are here is light that enlightens the interiors of the mind. That there is not given a complete and perfect thing unless it is a trine, geometry also teaches; for a line is not anything, unless it becomes an area; and an area is not anything, unless it becomes a solid; therefore the one must be produced into the other, that they may exist; and they coexist in the third. As it is in this, so it is in each and every created thing; they are terminated in their third. Hence now it is that three in the Word, spiritually understood signifies complete and"

Since it is so, I could not but wonder, that some profess faith alone, some charity alone, some works alone; when yet the first without the second, and the first and second without the third, are not anything.” [8] But I then asked, “Cannot a man have charity and faith, and still not works? Cannot a man be in affection and thought about anything, and yet not in the performance of it?” The angelic spirit said to me, “He cannot, except only ideally, but not really. He must still be in the endeavor or the will to operate; and the will or the endeavor is in itself the act, because it is in the continual effort to act; which becomes an outward act when determination is present. On which account the endeavor and will, as an interior act, is accepted by every wise man, because it is by God, altogether as an exterior act, provided it does not fail when opportunity is given.” [9] After this I descended by the steps from the temple of wisdom, and walked in the garden, and saw some sitting under a certain laurel eating figs. I turned aside to them, and asked them for some figs; which they gave me; and, behold, the figs became grapes in my hand. When I wondered at this, the angelic spirit, who was still with me, said to me, “The figs have become grapes in your hand, because figs, from correspondence signify the goods of charity and thence of faith in the natural or external man, but grapes the goods of charity and faith in the spiritual or internal man; and because you love spiritual things, therefore it so happened to you; for in our world all things come to pass and exist, and also are changed, according to correspondences.” And then there came over me the desire of knowing how man can do good from God, and yet as of himself; therefore I asked them that were eating the figs how they comprehended it. They said that they “could not comprehend it otherwise than that God operates it within in man and through man, when he does not know it; since if man were conscious of it, and thus should do it as of himself, which is also to do it of himself, he would not do good, but evil. For all that proceeds from man, as from himself, proceeds from his proprium; and the proprium of man is evil from birth. How then"

The proprium of man also, in the things of salvation, continually breathes forth merit; and as far as it does this, it takes away from the Lord his merit; which is the highest injustice and impiety. In a word, if the good which God operates in a man by the Holy Spirit should flow in into man’s willing and thence his doing, that good would be altogether defiled and also profaned; which, however, God never permits. A man can indeed think that the good which he does is from God, and call it God’s good through himself, and as if from himself; but still we do not comprehend this.” [10] But I then opened my mind, and said, “You do not comprehend, because you think from the appearance, and the thought from confirmed appearance is a fallacy. You are in the appearance and the fallacy from it, because you believe that all the things which a man wills and thinks, and thence does and speaks, are in him, and consequently from him; when yet nothing of them is in him except the state of receiving what flows in. Man is not life in himself, but is an organ receiving life. The Lord alone is life in himself, as he also says in John: As the Father hath life in himself, so hath he given to the son to have life in himself (John 5:26). [11] “Besides other places (as John 11:25; 14:6, 19). There are two things which make life, love and wisdom; or what is the same, the good of love and the truth of wisdom. These flow in from God, and are received by man, and are felt in the man as in him; and because they are felt by him as in him, they also proceed as from him. It is given by the Lord, that they should be thus felt by the man, in order that what flows in may affect him, and so be received and remain. But because all evil also flows in, not from God, but from hell, and this is received with enjoyment, because man was born such an organ, therefore no more of good is received from God, than there is of evil removed by the man as of himself; which is done by repentance, and at the same time by faith in the Lord."

All the things which are felt in the organs of those senses flow in from without, and are felt in them; in like manner in the organs of the internal senses, with the difference only that into the latter spiritual things flow in, which do not appear; but into the former natural things, which do appear. In a word, man is an organ recipient of life from God; consequently he is a recipient of good so far as he desists from evil. The Lord gives to every man to be able to desist from evil, because he gives him to will and understand as of himself; and whatever the man does from the will, as his own according to the understanding, as his own, or, what is the same, whatever he does from freedom which is of the will according to reason which is of the understanding, this remains. By this the Lord brings man into a state of conjunction with himself, and in this reforms, regenerates, and saves him. [13] “The life which flows in is the life proceeding from the Lord, which is also called the spirit of God, and in the Word the Holy Spirit; of which it is also said, that it enlightens and vivifies; yea, that it operates in man; but this life is varied and modified according to the organization induced upon the man by his love and attitude to it. You may also know that all the good of love and charity and all the truth of wisdom and faith flow in, and are not in the man, from the fact that he who thinks such a thing is in man from creation, cannot think otherwise than that God infused himself into a man, and thus that men would in part be Gods; and yet they who think this from faith become devils, and stink like carcasses. [14] “Besides, what is human action but the action of the mind? For that which the mind wills and thinks, it acts through its organ the body; and therefore when the mind is led by the Lord, the action is also led; and the mind and the action from it are led by the Lord, when it believes in him.

How could the Lord speak such things, if all that proceeds from man were meritorious, and thence evil? You may know, therefore, that if the mind is charity, the action is also charity; but if the mind is faith alone, which is also faith separated from spiritual charity, the action is also that faith; and this faith is meritorious, because its charity is natural, and not spiritual. It is otherwise with the faith of charity, because charity does not wish to merit, and thence neither does its faith.” [15] On hearing this, they that sat under the laurel said, “We comprehend that you have spoken justly; but still we do not comprehend.” To which I replied, “That I have spoken justly, you comprehend from the common perception which man has from the influx of light from heaven when he hears any truth; but you do not comprehend from your own perception, which man has from the influx of light from the world. These two perceptions, namely, the internal and the external, or the spiritual and the natural, make one with the wise.

From this you can see clearly, what faith separate from charity is and what faith conjoined to charity. Faith separated from charity is like the light in winter, and faith conjoined to charity is like the light in the spring. “Wintry light, which is light separated from heat, because it is conjoined to cold, strips the trees entirely of their leaves, hardens the earth and kills the grass, and likewise congeals the waters; but the light of spring, which is light conjoined to heat, quickens the trees, first into leaves, then into blossoms, and at length into fruits; it opens and softens the earth, that it may produce grass, herbs, flowers, and shrubs, and likewise dissolves the ice, that the waters may flow from the springs. [17] “It is altogether similar with faith and charity. Faith separate from charity deadens all things; and faith conjoined to charity vivifies all things. This vivifying and that deadening can be seen to the life in our spiritual world; because here faith is light, and charity is heat. For where there is faith conjoined to charity, there are paradisal gardens, flower beds, and grass plots in their pleasantness, according to the conjunction; but where there is faith separate from charity, there is not even grass there; and where it is green, it is from briars, thorns, and nettles. This the heat and light proceeding from the Lord as the sun effect in the angels and spirits, and thence outside of them.” There were then not far from us some of the clergy, whom the angelic spirit called justifiers and sanctifiers of men by faith alone, and likewise arcanists. We said these same things to them, and demonstrated them so that they saw that it was so; and when we asked, “Is it not so?” They turned themselves away, and said, “We did not hear.” But we cried out to them,"

And I saw a new heaven and a new earth signifies that a new heaven was formed from Christians by the Lord, which at this day is called the Christian heaven, where they are who had worshiped the Lord and had lived according to his commandments in the Word, in whom therefore there is charity and faith; in which heaven also are all the infants of Christians. By “a new heaven and a new earth” is not meant the natural heaven visible to the eyes, nor the natural earth inhabited by men, but the spiritual heaven is meant, and the earth belonging to that heaven, where the angels are. That this heaven and the earth of this heaven is meant, everyone may see and acknowledge, if he can in some measure be withdrawn from a purely natural and material idea, when he reads the Word. That the angelic heaven is meant is evident, because it is said in the next verse, that “he saw the holy city Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband,” by which is not meant any Jerusalem coming down, but the church, and the church on earth comes down from the Lord out of the angelic heaven, because the angels of heaven and the men on earth in all things of the church make one (n. 626). From these things it may be seen, how naturally and materially they have thought and do think, who, from these words and those which follow in the same verse, have fabricated for themselves the dogma about the destruction of the world, and of the new creation of all things. [2] This new heaven is occasionally treated of above in Revelation (especially in chapters 14 and 15). It is called the Christian heaven, because it is distinct from the ancient heavens, which existed from the men of the church before the Lord’s coming. These ancient heavens are above the Christian heaven; for the heavens are like expanses, one above another; it is the same with each particular heaven; for each heaven by itself is distinguished into three heavens, an inmost or third, a middle or second, and a lowest or first, and so it is with this new heaven; I have seen them and have spoken with them.

Various things respecting this heaven may be seen above (n. 612, 613, 626, 631, 659, 661, 845, 846, 856). In that heaven likewise are all the infants of Christians, because they are educated by the angels in those two essentials of the church, which are the acknowledgment of the Lord as the God of heaven and earth, and a life according to the commandments of the Decalogue. 877. For the former heaven and the former earth were passed away signifies the heavens which were formed, not by the Lord, but by those who came out of the Christian world into the spiritual world, who were all dispersed at the day of the last judgment. That these heavens and no others are meant by “the former heaven and the former earth which passed away” may be seen above (n. 865), where these words are explained: I saw a great white throne, and one sitting upon it, from whose face the heaven and the earth fled away (Rev. 20:11), where it is shown that by those words is signified the universal judgment executed by the Lord upon all the former heavens, in which were such as were in civil and moral good, but in no spiritual good, thus who in externals simulated Christians, but in internals were devils; which heavens with their earth were entirely dispersed. For other particulars relating to this subject see Last Judgment, published at London, 1758, and Continuation of the Last Judgment, published in Amsterdam; to which it is unnecessary here to add anything further. 878. And the sea was no more signifies that the external of the heaven collected from among Christians, since the first establishment of the church, was in like manner dispersed, after they who were written in the Lord’s book of life were taken thence and saved.

But the internal heaven of Christians was not fully formed by the Lord, till a little before the last judgment, and also after it, as may appear from chapters 14 and 15, where it is treated of, and from chapter 20:4–5; see the explanations of which. The reason why this was not done before was because the dragon and his two beasts had dominion in the world of spirits and burned with the lust of seducing everyone they could, wherefore it was hazardous to collect them sooner into a heaven. [2] The separation of the good from the dragonists, and the condemnation of the latter, and finally the casting of them into hell, are treated of in many places, and lastly in chapter 19:20, and in chapter 20:10; and after this it is said, that “the sea gave up the dead which were in it” (verse 13), by which are meant the external and natural men of the church called to judgment (see above, n. 869), and then the separating and saving of those who were written in the Lord’s book of life, concerning which see the same article; this is “the sea” which is here meant. It is also said in another place, where the new heaven of Christians is treated of, that it extended itself to “the sea of glass mingled with fire” (chapter 15:2); by which “sea” is also signified the external of the heaven of Christians (see the explanation, n. 659, 661). From these things it may appear that by “the sea was no more” is signified that the external of heaven collected from among Christians from the first establishment of the church, after they were taken thence and saved who were written in the Lord’s book of life, was in like manner dispersed. Concerning the external of heaven collected from among Christians from the first establishment of the church, it has been granted me to know many particulars which it would be tedious to adduce in this place; save only that the former heavens, which passed away at the day of the last judgment, were permitted for the sake of those who were in that external heaven or sea, because they were conjoined by externals but not by internals, on which subject"

The reason why the heaven, where the men of the external church are, is called “the sea” is because their habitation in the spiritual world appears at a distance as if it were in the sea; for the celestial angels, who are angels of the highest heaven, dwell as it were in an ethereal atmosphere; the spiritual angels, who are angels of the middle heaven, dwell as it were in an aerial atmosphere; and the spiritual natural angels, who are angels of the lowest heaven, dwell as it were in a watery atmosphere, which, as was said, appears at a distance like the sea. Hence it is that the external of heaven is meant by “the sea” in many other places also in the Word. 879. Verse 2. And I John saw the holy city new Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven signifies the new church to be established by the Lord at the end of the former church, which will be consociated with the new heaven in Divine truths as to doctrine and as to life. The reason why John here names himself, saying, “I John” is because by him as an apostle is signified the good of love to the Lord, and thence the good of life, therefore he was loved more than the other apostles, and at supper lay on the Lord’s breast (John 13:23; 21:20); and in like manner this church which is now treated of. That by “Jerusalem” is signified the church will be seen in the next article; which is called “a city” and described as a city from doctrine and from a life according to it, for “a city” in the spiritual sense signifies doctrine (n. 194, 712). It is called “holy” from the Lord, who alone is holy, and from the Divine truths which are in it derived from the Word from the Lord, which are called holy (n. 173, 586, 666, 852); and it is called “new” because he who sat upon the throne said, “Behold, I make all things new” (verse 5); and it is said, “to come down from God out of heaven,” because it descends from the Lord through the new Christian heaven, treated of in verse 1 of this chapter (n. 876), for the church on earth is formed through heaven by the Lord, that they may act as one and be consociated. 880.

Hence it is that “Jerusalem” signifies the church as to worship, and therefore also the church as to doctrine, for worship is prescribed in doctrine, and performed according to it; likewise because the Lord was in Jerusalem, and taught in his temple, and afterwards glorified his human there. That by “Jerusalem” is meant the church as to doctrine and thence worship, appears from many passages in the Word; as from the following in Isaiah: For Zion’s sake will I not be silent, and for Jerusalem’s sake I will not rest, until the justice thereof go forth as brightness, and the salvation thereof as a lamp burneth. Then the Gentiles shall see thy justice, and all kings thy glory; and thou shalt be called by a new name, which the mouth of Jehovah shall name; thou shalt also be a crown of glory in the hand of thy God; for Jehovah is well pleased in thee, and thy land shall be married. Behold, thy salvation cometh; Behold, his reward is with him. And they shall call them, The people of holiness, the redeemed of Jehovah; and thou shalt be called, Sought out, A city not deserted (Isa. 62:1–4, 11–12). [2] The whole of this chapter treats of the Lord’s advent, and of the new church to be established by him. This new church is meant by “Jerusalem” which shall be called by a new name which the mouth of Jehovah shall utter, and which shall be a crown of glory in the hands of Jehovah, and a royal tiara in the hand of God, in which Jehovah shall be well pleased, and which shall be called a city sought out and not deserted. These words cannot apply to that Jerusalem which, when the Lord came into the world, was inhabited by the Jews, for it was directly opposite in every respect, and was rather to be called Sodom, as it is also called (in the Rev. 11:8; Isa. 3:9; Jer. 23:14; Ezek. 16:46, 48). [3] So in another part of Isaiah: For, behold, I create a new heaven and a new earth; the former shall not be remembered; be glad and exult to eternity in that which I create; behold I create Jerusalem an exultation, and her people a joy. And I will exult over Jerusalem, and rejoice over my people. Then the wolf and the lamb shall feed together; they shall not do evil in all the mountain of my holiness (Isa. 65:17–19, 25)."

[4] So in another part of Isaiah: Awake, awake, put on thy strength, O Zion; put on the garments of thy beauty, O Jerusalem, the city of holiness; for henceforth there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean. Shake thyself from the dust; arise, and sit down, O Jerusalem. My people shall know my name in that day, for I am he that doth speak; behold it is I, Jehovah hath comforted his people; he hath redeemed Jerusalem (Isa. 52:1–2, 6, 9). This chapter also treats of the Lord’s advent, and of the church to be established by him, therefore by “Jerusalem” into which “the uncircumcised and the unclean shall no more come” and which “the Lord will redeem” is meant the church, and by “Jerusalem the city of holiness”; the church as to doctrine from the Lord and concerning the Lord. [5] In Zephaniah: Shout, O daughter of Zion, be glad with all the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem; the king of Israel is in the midst of thee; fear not evil anymore; he will rejoice over thee with joy, he will rest in thy love, he will exult over thee with shouting; I will give you for a name and a praise to all the people of the earth (Zeph. 3:14–15, 17, 20). Here in like manner the Lord and the church from him are treated of, over which “the king of Israel” who is the Lord, “will rejoice with joy, will exult with shouting” and in whose love “he will rest” and who will give them “for a name and a praise to all the people of the earth.”"

It is said that John “saw the holy city new Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven”; here that he saw that city “prepared as a bride adorned for her husband” from which it is also evident that by “Jerusalem” is meant the church, and that he saw it first as a city, and afterwards as a virgin bride; as a city representatively, and as a virgin bride spiritually, thus in a twofold idea, one within or above the other; just as the angels do, who, when they see or hear or read in the Word of “a city” in the idea of the lower thought perceive a city, but in the idea of the higher thought perceive the church as to doctrine; and the latter, if they desire it and pray to the Lord, they see as a virgin in beauty and clothing according to the quality of the church. Thus also it has been granted me to see the church."

That by “husband” is meant the Lord is plain from verses 9 and 10 of this chapter, where Jerusalem is called “the bride the lamb’s wife.” That the Lord is called “the bridegroom” and “husband,” the church “the bride” and “wife,” and that this marriage is like the marriage of good and truth, and is effected through the Word, may be seen above (n. 797). From these things it may appear, that by “Jerusalem prepared as a bride for her husband” is signified that church conjoined with the Lord through the Word. 882. Verse 3. And I heard a great voice out of heaven, saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men signifies the Lord from love speaking and declaring the glad tidings, that he himself will now be present with men in his Divine human. This is the celestial sense of these words. The celestial angels, who are the angels of the third heaven, understand them no otherwise, for by “hearing a great voice from heaven saying” they understand the Lord from love speaking and declaring glad tidings, because no one else speaks from heaven but the Lord; for heaven is not heaven from anything proper to the angels, but from the Divine of the Lord, of which they are recipients; by “a great voice” is meant speech from love, for “great” is predicated of love (n. 656, 663). “Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men” means that now the Lord is present in his Divine human. By “the tabernacle of God” is meant the celestial church, and, in the universal sense, the Lord’s celestial kingdom, and, in the highest sense, his Divine human, see above (n. 585). The reason why the tabernacle, in the highest sense, means the Lord’s Divine human is because this is signified by “the temple,” as may appear from John 2:19, 21; Mal. 3:1; Rev. 21:22; and elsewhere; the same is meant by “the tabernacle” with this difference, that by “the temple” is meant the Lord’s Divine human as to the Divine truth or the Divine wisdom, and by “the"

Hence it follows, that by “behold the tabernacle of God is with men” is meant that the Lord will now be present with men in his Divine human. 883. And he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and he himself shall be with them their God signifies the conjunction of the Lord, which is such that they are in him, and he in them. “He will dwell with them” signifies the conjunction of the Lord with them, as will be seen presently; “they shall be his people, and he himself shall be with them their God” signifies that they are the Lord’s, and the Lord theirs; and because by “dwelling with them” is signified conjunction, it signifies that they will be in the Lord and the Lord in them, otherwise no conjunction is effected; that this is the nature of conjunction appears clearly from the Lord’s words in John: Abide in me, and I in you. I am the vine, ye are the branches; he that abideth in me and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit; for without me ye can do nothing (John 15:4–5). In that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you (John 14:20). He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him (John 6:56). [2] That the assumption of the human, and the uniting it with the Divine which was in him by birth, and is called the Father, had for its end conjunction with men, appears also in John: For I sanctify myself, that they also may be sanctified in the truth; that they may be one; as we are one, I in them and thou in me (John 17:19, 21–22, 26). From which it is plain, that there is a conjunction with the Lord’s Divine human, and that it is reciprocal, and that thus and not otherwise there is a conjunction with the Divine which is called the Father."

This therefore is what is meant by “he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and he himself will be with them their God.” In like manner in other places where the same words occur, as Jer. 7:23; 11:4; Ezek. 14:11; Jer. 24:7; 30:22; Ezek. 11:20; 36:28; 37:23, 27; Zech. 8:8; Exod. 29:45. [4] The reason why “to dwell with them” signifies conjunction with them is because “to dwell” signifies conjunction from love, as may appear from many passages in the Word; also from the habitations of the angels in heaven. Heaven is distinguished into innumerable societies, one from another according to the differences of the affections which are of love in general and in particular, each society constituting one species of affection, and they dwell there distinctly according to the degrees of relationship and affinities of that species of affection, and they who are in the closest relationship dwell in the same house; hence “cohabitation” when spoken of married partners signifies, in the spiritual sense, conjunction by love. It is known that conjunction with the Lord is one thing, and his presence another; conjunction with the Lord is not given except to those who approach him immediately, and his presence to the rest. 884. Verse 4. And God shall wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither mourning nor crying, neither shall labor be anymore, for the former things have passed away signifies that the Lord will take from them all grief of mind, fear of damnation on account of evils and falsities from hell, and of temptations from them, and they shall not remem ber them, because the dragon, which had occasioned them, is cast out. “God shall wipe away every tear from their eyes” signifies that the Lord will take away from them all grief of mind, for shedding tears is from grief of mind; by “death” which shall not be anymore is signified damnation (as n. 325, 765, 853, 873), here the fear of it; by “mourning” which shall not be anymore is signified the fear of evils from hell, for “mourning” has various significations, having relation in all cases to the subject treated of, here the fear of evils from hell; because the fear of damnation is mentioned just before, and the fear of falsities"

[2] But these things shall be illustrated. Every man after death first comes into the world of spirits, which is midway between heaven and hell, and is there prepared, the good for heaven and the evil for hell, concerning which world see above (n. 784, 791, 843, 850, 866, 869). And because there are consociations there as in the natural world, it could not be otherwise before the last judgment, than that they who in externals were civil and moral, but in internals were evil, should be together, and should hold converse with those who likewise in externals were civil and moral, but in internals were good. And since there is inherent in the evil the continual lust of seducing, therefore the good, who were in consort with them, were infested in various ways. But they who were in grief by their infestations, and came into the fear of damnation, and of evils and falsities from hell, and of grievous temptation, were removed by the Lord from consort with them, and sent to a certain earth below that, where also there were societies, and were guarded there, and this until such time as all the evil were separated from the good, which was effected by the last judgment; and then they who had been guarded in the lower earth, were taken up by the Lord into heaven. [3] These infestations were induced for the most part by those who are meant by “the dragon” and his “beasts.” Therefore when the dragon and his two beasts were cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, then, because all infestation and thence grief and fear on account of damnation and of hell ceased, it is said to those who had been infested, that “God will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither mourning, nor crying, nor"

That the dragon and his two beasts were ejected, and cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, may be seen above (Rev. 19:20; 20:10); and that the dragon infested, appears from many places; for he fought with Michael, and wished to devour the offspring which the woman brought forth, and persecuted the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed (Rev. 12:4–5, 7–9, 13–17; 13:1, also 16:13, 16), and in other places. That many who were interiorly good, were thus guarded by the Lord lest they should be infested by the dragon and his beasts, appears from Rev. 6:9–11; and that they were infested, Rev. 7:13–17, and that they were afterwards taken up into heaven, Rev. 20:4, 5, and elsewhere. The same are also meant by “the captives” and by “them that are bound in the pit” and delivered by the Lord (Isa. 24:22; 61:1; Luke 4:18, 19; Zech. 9:11; Ps. 79:11). This is also signified in the Word, where it is said that the graves were opened; also where the souls are spoken of that expect the last judgment, and then the resurrection. 885. That “crying” in the Word is said of grief and fear of falsities from hell, and thence of devastation by them, appears from the following passages: The former troubles are forgotten, and they shall be hidden from mine eyes; then the voice of weeping shall not be heard in her, nor the voice of crying (Isa. 65:16, 19); speaking of Jerusalem in like manner as here in Revelation: They are blackened in the land, and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up (Jer. 14:2 seq.). Lamentation over the falsities which devastate the church is treated of: Jehovah looked for judgment, but behold a scab; for justice, but behold a cry (Isa. 5:7)."

Besides other places (as Isa. 14:31; 15:4–6, 8; 24:11; 30:19; Jer. 46:12, 14).

Verse 5. And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he said unto me, Write, for these words are true and faithful signifies the Lord speaking concerning the last judgment to those who are about to come into the world of spirits, or who would die, from the time of his being in the world until now, and saying these things, that the former heaven with the former earth, and the former church, with all and everything in them, would perish, and that he would create a new heaven with a new earth, and a new church, which is to be called the new Jerusalem, and that they may know this of a certainty, and bear it in remembrance, because the Lord himself has testified and said it. The contents of this verse and of those which follow, as far as the eighth inclusive, were said to those who would come out of the Christian world into the world of spirits, which happens immediately after death, to the end that they might not suffer themselves to be seduced by the Babylonians and dragonists; for, as was said above, all after death are gathered together in the world of spirits, and cherish social interaction with one another there as in the natural world, where they are together with the Babylonians and dragonists, who continually burn with the lust of seducing, and who were also allowed, by imaginary and delusive arts, to form to themselves heavens, as it were, by which also they could seduce; to prevent this, these things were said by the Lord, that they might know of a certainty that those heavens with their earths would perish, and that the Lord would create a new heaven and a new earth, when they would be saved who did not suffer themselves to"

But it is to be known, that this was said to those who lived from the Lord’s time even to the last judgment, which was executed in the year 1757, because these could have been seduced; but after this event, this was no longer possible, because the Babylonians and dragonists were separated and cast out. [2] We will now proceed to the explanation. By “him who sat on the throne” is meant the Lord (n. 808, at the end). The reason why the Lord here spoke “upon a throne” is because he said, “Behold, I make all things new” by which is signified that he was about to execute the last judgment, and then to create a new heaven and a new earth, and a new church, with all and everything in them; that “a throne” means judgment in a representative form, may be seen (n. 229, 845, 865); and that the former heaven and former church perished on the day of the last judgment (n. 865, 877). “He said unto me, Write, for these words are true and faithful” signifies that they might know this for certain, and remember it, because the Lord himself testified and said it; the Lord’s making use of the word “said” a second time signifies that they might know it for certain; by “write” is signified for remembrance or that they might remember (n. 639); and by “these words are true and faithful” is signified that they ought to be believed, because the Lord himself testified and said it. 887. Verse 6. And he said unto me, It is done signifies that it is the Divine truth. The reason why by “he said unto me” is signified that it is the Divine truth is because the Lord said a third time, “he said unto me”; also because he said “it is done” in the present tense; and what the Lord says a third time is what ought to be believed, because it is the Divine truth, as also what he said in the present tense; for “three signifies what is complete to the end” (n. 505); in like manner when being about to do a thing, he said, “It is done.” 888. I am the alpha and the omega, the beginning and the end signifies that they may know that the Lord is the God of heaven and earth, and that all things in the heavens and earths were made by him, and are governed by his Divine providence, and are done according to it. That the Lord is “the alpha and omega, the"

That the Lord is the God of heaven and earth is evident from his words in John: Power is given to me over all flesh (John 17:2). And in Matthew: All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth (Matt. 28:18); And that all things were made by him, that were made (John 1:3, 14). That all things which were made or created by him, are governed by his Divine providence is evident. 889. I will give unto him that thirsteth of the fountain of the water of life freely signifies that to those who desire truths from any spiritual use, the Lord will give from himself through the Word all things that are conducive to that use. By “him that thirsteth” is signified he who desires truth from any spiritual use will be seen presently; by “the fountain of the water of life” is signified the Lord and the Word (n. 384); by “giving freely” is signified from the Lord, and not from man’s own intelligence. The reason why by “thirsting” is signified to desire for the sake of some spiritual use is because there is given a thirst or desire for the knowledges of truth from the Word, from natural use, and also from spiritual use, from natural use with those who have learning for their end, and by learning, fame, honor, and gain, thus self and the world; but from spiritual use with those whose end is to serve the neighbor from love to him, to consult the good of their souls, and that of their own, thus on account of the Lord, the neighbor, and salvation; truth is given to these so far as it conduces to that use, “from the fountain of the water of life,” that is, from the Lord through the Word; to the rest truth is not given from thence; they read the Word, and every doctrinal truth therein they either do not see, or if they do see it they turn it into falsity, not so much in speech when it is uttered from the Word, but in the idea of their thought"

By “overcoming” is here meant to overcome evils in themselves, thus the devil, and not to succumb when they are tempted by the Babylonians and dragonists. The reason why to overcome evils in oneself is also to overcome the devil is because by the “devil” is meant all evil; by “to possess as an inheritance all things” is signified to come into heaven, and then to enjoy the possession of the goods which are there from the Lord, consequently to enter into the goods which are from the Lord and of the Lord, as a son and heir, whence heaven is called an inheritance (Matt 19:29; 25:34). “I will be his God and he shall be my son” signifies that in heaven they will be in the Lord and the Lord in them, as above (n. 882, 883), where the like words occur, only that it is there said that “they shall be his people, and he will be their God.” The reason why they who immediately approach the Lord are called his sons is because they are born anew from him, that is, regenerated, wherefore he called his disciples “sons” (John 12:36; 13:33; 21:5). 891. Verse 8. But the fearful, and the unfaithful, and the abominable signifies those who are in no faith, and in no charity, and thence in evils of every kind.

(Jer. 7:2–4, 9–11); and so in all other places. That by “the fearful” are signified they who are in no faith is evident from the following passages: Jesus said to the disciples, Why are ye fearful, O men of little faith? (Matt. 8:26; Mark 4:39, 40; Luke 8:25) Jesus said unto the ruler of the synagogue, Fear not; believe only, then thy daughter shall be saved (Luke 8:49, 50; Mark 5:36). Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom (Luke 12:32). The same is meant by “fear not” (Matt. 17:6, 7; 28:3–5, 10; Luke 1:12–13, 30; 2:9–10; 5:8–10, and elsewhere). From all these things it may appear, that by “the fearful, and the unfaithful, and the abominable” are signified they who are in no faith, and in no charity, and thence are in all kinds of evils. 892. And murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars signifies all those who make no account of the commandments of the Decalogue, and do not shun any evils therein mentioned as sins, and therefore live in them. What is signified by these four commandments of the Decalogue, “thou shalt not kill,” “thou shalt not commit adultery,” “thou shalt not steal,” and “thou shalt not testify falsely” in their threefold sense, natural, spiritual, and celestial, may be seen in Doctrine of Life (n. 62–91); therefore it is unnecessary to explain them here; but instead of the seventh3 commandment, which is “thou shalt not steal,” are here mentioned “sorcerers and idolaters”; and by “sorcerers” are signified they who inquire after truths, which they falsify in order to confirm falsities and evils, as they do who take up this truth, that no one can do good from himself, and by it confirm faith alone, for this is a species of spiritual theft."

That church is called “the bride” when it is being established, and “wife” when it is established; here “the bride, the wife” because it is certain to be established. 896. Verse 10.

The reason why being taken up “into a mountain” signifies to be taken up into the third heaven is because it is said “in the spirit” and he who is in the spirit as to his mind and its sight is in the spiritual world, and there the angels of the third heaven dwell upon mountains, the angels of the second heaven upon hills, and the angels of the lowest heaven in valleys between the hills and mountains. Therefore when anyone in the spirit is taken up into a mountain, it signifies that he is taken up into the third heaven; this elevation is effected in a moment, because it is done by a change in the state of the mind; by “he showed me” is signified his sight then opened, and manifestation.

It was also seen as a city, that it might be described as to all its quality, and this is described by its wall, gates, foundations, and various measures. The church is described in a similar manner in Ezekiel, where it is also said that the prophet: In the visions of God was brought upon a very high mountain, and he saw a city on the south, which the angel also measured as to its wall and gates, and as to its breadth and height (Ezek. 40:2 seq.). The like is meant by this passage in Zechariah: I said to the angel, Whither goest thou? he said, To measure Jerusalem, to see what is the breadth thereof, and what is the length thereof (Zech. 2:2). 897. Verse 11. Having the glory of God; and her light was like unto a stone most precious, as it were a jasper stone, shining like crystal signifies that in that church the Word will be understood, because translucent from its spiritual sense. By “the glory of God” is signified the Word in its Divine light, as will be seen presently; by “its light” is signified the Divine truth therein, for this is meant by light in the Word (n. 796, 799); like a stone most precious, like a jasper stone, “shining like crystal” signifies the same shining and translucent from its spiritual sense, of which also in what follows. By these words is described the understanding of the Word with those who are in the doctrine of the new Jerusalem, and in a life according to it. With these the Word shines as it were when it is read; it shines from the Lord by means of the spiritual sense, because the Lord is the Word, and the spiritual sense is in the light of heaven which proceeds from the Lord as a sun, and the light which proceeds from the Lord as a sun is in its essence the Divine truth of his Divine wisdom. That in every particular of the Word there is a spiritual sense, in which the angels are, and from which their wisdom is derived, and that the Word is translucent from the light of that sense to those who are in genuine truths from the Lord is shown in Doctrine of Sacred Scripture."

That by “glory” is meant the glory of the Word or the Divine truth in him is evident, because it is said “the Word was made flesh”; the same is meant by “glory” in what follows, where it is said: The glory of God did lighten it, and its lamp is the lamb (John 1:23). The same is meant by: The glory in which they will see the son of man when he shall come in the clouds of heaven (Matt. 24:30; Mark 13:26). See above (n. 22, 642, 820); nor is anything else meant by: The throne of glory upon which the Lord will sit when he shall come to the last judgment (Matt. 25:31); because he will judge everyone according to the truths of the Word; wherefore it is also said that “he will come in his glory.” It is also said that when the Lord was transfigured: Moses and Elias appeared in glory (Luke 9:30–31). By “Moses and Elias” is there signified the Word; the Lord also then caused himself to be seen by the disciples as the Word in its glory. That “glory” signifies the Divine truth may be seen from many passages of the Word above (n. 629). [3] The reason why the Word is compared to “a stone most precious, like a jasper stone, shining like crystal” is because “a precious stone” signifies the Divine truth of the Word (n. 231, 540, 726, 823), and “a jasper stone” signifies the Divine truth of the Word in the sense of the letter, translucent from the Divine truth in the spiritual sense; this is the signification of “a jasper"

Verse 12. Having a wall great and high signifies the Word in the sense of the letter from which is the doctrine of the new church. When the Lord’s new church as to doctrine is meant by “the holy city Jerusalem,” nothing else is meant by its “wall” but the Word in the sense of the letter, from which the doctrine is; for that sense protects the spiritual sense, which lies hidden within, as the wall does a city and its inhabitants. That the sense of the letter is the basis, the container, and the support of its spiritual sense, may be seen in Doctrine of Sacred Scripture (n. 27–36) And that this sense is the guard, lest the interior Divine truths, which are those of the spiritual sense, should be injured (n. 97). Also that the doctrine of the church is to be drawn from the sense of the letter of the Word, and to be confirmed by it (n. 50–61). It is called “a wall great and high” because the Word is meant as to the Divine good and the Divine truth; for “great” is predicated of good, and “high” of truth, as above (n. 896). [2] By “a wall” is signified that which protects; and in speaking of the church, the Word in the sense of the letter is signified in the following passages: I have set watchmen upon thy walls, O Jerusalem; they shall not be silent day and night, that make mention of Jehovah (Isa. 62:6). They shall call thee the city of Jehovah, the Zion of the holy one of Israel; and thou shalt call thy walls salvation, and thy gates praise (Isa. 60:14, 18). Jehovah will be a wall of fire round about, and a glory in the midst of her (Zech. 2:5). The sons of Arvad were upon thy walls, and the Gammadians hung their shields upon thy walls round about; they have made thy beauty perfect (Ezek. 27:11)."

They shall run to and fro in the city, they shall run on the wall, they shall go up into the houses, they shall enter in through the windows (Joel 2:9).

Besides other places, as Isa. 22:5; 56:5; Jer. 1:15; Ezek. 27:11; Lam. 2:7. That the Word in the sense of the letter is signified by “a wall” is clearly manifest from what follows in this chapter, where the wall, its gates, foundations, and measures are much treated of. The reason is because the doctrine of the new church, which is signified by “the city,” is solely from the sense of the letter of the Word. 899. Having twelve gates signifies all the knowledges of truth and good there, by which a man is introduced into the church. By “the gates” are signified the knowledges of truth and good from the Word, because by them a man is introduced into the church; for “the wall” in which the gates were signifies the Word; as explained just above (n. 898); and it is said in what follows, that “the twelve gates were twelve pearls, each one of the gates was one pearl” (verse 21); and by “pearls” the knowledges of truth and good are signified (n. 727). That a man is introduced into the church by them, as through the gates into a city, is manifest. That “twelve” signifies all, may be seen above (n. 348). Knowledges of truth and good are also signified by “gates” in these passages: I will lay thy foundations with sapphires, and I will make thy suns of ruby, and thy gates in stones of carbuncle (Isa. 54:11–12)."

By “twelve angels” are signified here all the truths and goods of heaven, because by “angels” in the highest sense is signified the Lord, in a general sense the heaven of angels, and in a particular sense the truths and goods of heaven from the Lord (see n. 5, 170, 258, 344, 415, 465, 647, 648, 657, 718); here the truths and goods of heaven, because it follows, “and names written thereon, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel” by which are signified all the truths and goods of the church (n. 349). By “over the gates” is signified in those knowledges, because “over” in the Word signifies within; the reason is because that which is highest in successive order becomes the inmost in simultaneous order; therefore the third heaven is called both the highest and the inmost heaven; hence it is that “over the gates” signifies in the knowledges of truth; by “names written thereon” is signified every quality of them, thus also in them, for all quality is from internals in externals. The reason why by the same words are signified guards lest anyone enter into the church, unless he be in those knowledges from the Lord, is that the angels were seen standing over the gates, and also the names of the tribes of Israel were written over them. It is said that the truths and goods of heaven and the church are in the knowledges which are from the Word, by which introduction into the church is effected, because the knowledges of truth and good from the Word, when there is in them the spiritual from heaven from the Lord, are not called knowledges, but truths; but if there is not in them the spiritual from heaven from the Lord, they are nothing but knowledges."

By “gates” are now signified the knowledges of truth and good, in which there is spiritual life from heaven from the Lord, because over the gates there were twelve angels, and the names written of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel, by which that life in those knowledges is signified, as is evident from what was explained above (n. 900); that “gates” signify the knowledges of truth and good, by which introduction into the new church is effected, may be seen above (n. 899). The reason why there were three gates on the east, three on the north, three on the south, and three on the west, is because by “the east” is signified love and the affection of good in a higher degree, thus more; and by “the west” is signified love and the affection of good in a lower degree, thus less; by “the south” is signified wisdom and the affection of truth in a higher degree, thus more; and by “the north” is signified wisdom and the affection of truth in a lower degree, thus less. The reason of this signification of “east,” “west,” “north,” and “south” is because the Lord is the sun of the spiritual world, and from his face are the east and west, and at the sides are the south and north, on the right side the south, and on the left side the north, wherefore they who are in love to the Lord, and thence more in affection, dwell in the east; they who are less so, in the west; and they who are more in wisdom from the affection of truth, dwell in the south; and they who are less so in the north.

The church also is founded upon doctrine, for doctrine teaches how we are to believe, and how we are to live, and doctrine is to be drawn from no other source than the Word; that it is from the sense of the letter of the Word, may be seen in Doctrine of Sacred Scripture (n. 50–61). Since all things of doctrine are signified by “the twelve foundations of the wall of the city new Jerusalem” and as the church is a church from doctrine, therefore its foundations are particularly treated of below (verses 19–20).

And in them the names of the twelve apostles of the lamb signifies all things of doctrine from the Word concerning the Lord and concerning a life according to his commandments. The reason why in the foundations were written “the names of the twelve apostles of the lamb” is because by “the twelve apostles” is signified the Lord’s church as to all things of it (n. 79, 233, 790), here as to all things of its doctrine, because their names were written over “the twelve foundations” by which are signified all things of the doctrine of the new Jerusalem (n. 902); by “twelve names” are signified all its quality, and all its quality has relation to two things in doctrine, and thence in that church, concerning the Lord and concerning life according to his commandments, therefore these are signified. The reason why all things of the doctrine of the new Jerusalem have relation to these two things is because they are its universals, on which all the particulars depend, and they are the essentials from which all its formal things proceed; they are therefore as the soul and life of all things of its doctrine. They are indeed two, but one cannot be separated from the other, for to separate them would be like separating the Lord from man, and man from the Lord, in which case there is no church.

These things are said, that it may be known that all things of the doctrine of the new Jerusalem relate to love to the Lord and to love toward the neighbor. Love to the Lord is to have faith in the Lord and to do his commandments, and to do his commandments is love toward the neighbor, because to do his commandments is to do uses to the neighbor. That they love the Lord who do his commandments, the Lord himself teaches in John (14:21–24); and that love to God and love toward the neighbor are the two commandments upon which hang all the law and the prophets (Matt. 22:35–38); by “the law and the prophets” is meant the Word in its whole complex. 904. Verse 15.

And “he that spoke with me” signifies the Lord speaking out of heaven, because he was one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, mentioned above (verse 9), by whom is meant the Lord speaking out of heaven (n. 895); by “a reed” is signified power or faculty from the good of love, by “a reed” power or faculty (n. 485), and by “gold” the good of love (n. 211, 726); by “measuring” is signified to know the quality of a thing, consequently to understand and know (n. 486).

Such a spiritual sense is also contained in what is said above, where these words occur: And there was given unto me a reed, like unto a staff, and the angel stood, saying, Arise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that adore therein (Rev. 11:1). There is also a like spiritual sense in all the things which the angel “measured with a reed” (in Ezekiel, chapter 40–48). And likewise in these words in Zechariah: I lifted up mine eyes and saw, and behold, a man with a measuring line in his hand. And I said, Where art thou going?

It is owing to this signification of “a square” that in common discourse a man is said to be “square” who is a man that does not from injustice incline either to this or that party. Because “foursquare” signifies what is just, therefore, the altar of burnt offering, by which was signified worship from good and thence from celestial truth, was “foursquare” (Exod. 27:1); also the altar of incense, by which was signified worship from good and thence from spiritual truth, was likewise “foursquare” (Exod. 30:1, 2).

The reason why it signifies that good and truth in that church make one like essence and form is because it is said that “its length is as large as the breadth” and by “length” is signified the good of the church, and by “breadth” its truth, as was said; the reason why they make one like essence and form is because truth is the form of good, and good is the essence of truth, and essence and form make one. 907. And he measured the city with a reed, twelve thousand stadia.

By “stadia” are signified the same as by measures, and by “measures” are signified quality (n. 313, 486). The reason why it is said that “the length, breadth, and height of it are equal” is that all things of that church were from the good of love, for by “length” is signified the good of love, and by “breadth” the truth from that good (n. 906); and by “height” is signified good and truth together in every degree, for height is from the highest to the lowest, and the highest descends to the lowest by degrees, which are called degrees of altitude, in which the heavens are, from the highest or third heaven to the lowest or first; concerning these degrees see the treatise on Divine Love and Wisdom, chapter 3.

It would even reach up an immense way into the ether toward the zenith. That by these three being equal is signified that all things of that church are from the good of love appears also from what follows, for it is said that “the city was pure gold like unto pure glass” (verse 18); and also that “the street of the city was pure gold like pellucid glass” (verse 21), and by “gold” is signified the good of love.

That all things of heaven and of the church are from the good of love, and the good of love is from the Lord, cannot be seen, and therefore it cannot be known, unless it be demonstrated. The reason why it is not known in consequence of its not being seen is because good does not enter into the thought of man like truth, for truth is seen in the thought, because as it is from the light of heaven, but good is only felt, because it is from the heat of heaven, and it rarely happens that anyone, while reflecting upon what he thinks, attends to what he feels, but only to what he sees. This is the reason why the learned have attributed all things to thought and not to the affection; and why the church has attributed all things to faith, and not to love, when, nevertheless, the truth, which at this day in the church is said to be of faith, or is called faith, is only the form of good which is of love, see above (n. 875). Now because man does not see good in his thought, for good, as was said, is only felt, and is felt under various species of delight, and because man does not attend to the things which he feels in thought, but to those which he sees there, therefore he calls all that good which he feels delightful, and he feels evil as delightful, because this is ingenerate from birth, and proceeds from the love of self and the world. This is the reason why it is not known that the"

[2] That is what is meant by the Lord’s words that the law and the prophets hang upon these two commandments: Thou shalt love God above all things, and the neighbor as thyself (Matt. 22:35–40). And I can assert, that there does not exist a grain of truth, which in itself is truth in man, except so far as it is from the good of love from the Lord; and therefore neither is there a grain of faith, which in itself is faith, that is a living, saving, and spiritual faith, except so far as it is from charity which is from the Lord. Since the good of love is the all of heaven and the church, therefore the whole heaven and the whole church are arranged by the Lord according to the affections of love, and not according to anything of thought separated from them; for thought is affection in form; as speech is sound in form. 909. Verse 17. And he measured the wall thereof a hundred forty- four cubits signifies that it was shown what the quality of the Word is in that church, and that from it they have all their truths and goods. By “he measured” is signified that its quality was shown, as above (n. 907); by “the wall” is signified the Word in its literal sense (n. 898); by “a hundred and forty-four” are signified all the truths and goods of the church from the Word (n. 348); by “cubits” is signified quality, the same as by “measure”; for by “one hundred and forty-four” is signified the same as by “twelve,” because from twelve multiplied by twelve arises the number one hundred and forty-four, and multiplying it does not take away its signification. 910. The measure of a man, which is of an angel signifies the quality of that church that it makes one with heaven. By “measure” is signified the quality of a thing (n. 313, 486); by “man” here is signified the church from men, and by “angel” is signified heaven"

By “man” in the Word is signified intelligence and wisdom from the Word (n. 243), and intelligence and wisdom from the Word in man, are the church with him; hence by “man” in the concrete or in general, that is, when a society or assembly is called a man, in the spiritual sense is meant the church. Hence it is that the prophets were called “sons of man” and that the Lord himself called himself “the son of man” and “the son of man” is the truth of the church from the Word, and when said of the Lord is the Word itself from which the church exists. By “an angel” three things are signified, in the highest sense the Lord, in a general sense heaven or a heavenly society, and in a particular sense the Divine truth; that these three things are signified by “an angel” may be seen (n. 5, 65, 170, 258, 342, 344, 415, 465, 644, 647, 648, 657, 718); here it signifies heaven, with which the Lord’s new church will make one. That the church which is from the Word, and thus from the Lord, is in consociation with heaven, and in conjunction with the Lord, may be seen above (n. 818); but it is otherwise with a church which is not from the Word of the Lord. 911. Verse 18. And the structure of the wall thereof was of jasper signifies that every Divine truth in the sense of the letter of the Word with the men of that church is translucent from the Divine truth in the spiritual sense. By “a wall” is signified the Word in the sense of the letter (n. 898); by its “structure” is signified the all of it, because the all of it is in the structure. By “jasper” the same is signified as by “precious stone” in general, and by “precious stone” in reference to the Word is signified Divine truth in the sense of the letter of the Word translucent from the Divine truth in the spiritual sense (n. 231, 540, 726, 823); that the same is signified by “jasper” may be seen above (n. 897). The reason why it is translucent is because Divine truth in the sense of the letter is in natural light, and Divine truth in the spiritual sense is in spiritual light, wherefore when spiritual light flows into natural light with a man who is reading the Word, he is enlightened, and sees truths there, for the objects of spiritual light are truths."

And the city was pure gold like unto pure glass signifies that thence everything of that church is the good of love flowing in together with light out of heaven from the Lord. By “the city,” or Jerusalem, is meant the Lord’s new church as to everything of it interiorly regarded, or within the wall. By “gold” is signified the good of love from the Lord, as will be seen presently; and “like unto pure glass” signifies pellucid from the Divine wisdom, and since the latter appears in heaven as light, and flows in from the Lord as a sun, by “like unto pure glass” is signified flowing in together with light from heaven and the Lord. It is shown above (n. 908), that all things of heaven and the church are from the good of love, and that the good of love is from the Lord; here it is now said that the city was seen as “pure gold,” by which is signified that the all of the new church, which is the new Jerusalem, is the good of love from the Lord; but since the good of love is not given solitary or abstracted from the truths of wisdom, but that it may be the good of love, it must be formed, and it is formed by the truths of wisdom, therefore it is here said “pure gold like unto pure glass”; for the good of love without the truths of wisdom has not any quality, because it has not any form, and its form is according to its truths flowing in in their order and connection together with the good of love from the Lord, thus it is in man according to reception. It is said in man, but it is to be under stood not as being of the man, but as of the Lord in him. From these things, then, it is plain, that by “the city was pure gold like unto pure glass” is signified that thence the all of that church is the good of love flowing in with light from heaven from the Lord. 913.

Thence it is that these metals exist also in the spiritual world, by reason that all things that appear there are correspondences, for they correspond to the affections and thence to the thoughts of the angels, which in themselves are spiritual. That “gold” from correspondence signifies the good of love, may appear from the following passages: I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich (Rev. 3:18). How is the gold become dim, and the best refined gold changed; the stones of holiness are poured out at the head of all the streets; the sons of Zion were esteemed equal to pure gold (Lam. 4:1–2). He shall save the souls of the poor, and shall give them of the gold of Sheba (Ps. 72:13, 15). For brass I will bring gold, and for iron silver, and for wood brass, and for stones iron; and I will make thine officers peace, and thine exacters justice (Isa. 60:17). Behold, thou art wise, no secret lies hid from thee; in thy wisdom and in thy intelligence thou hast gotten thee gold and silver in thy treasuries; thou hast been in Eden, every precious stone was thy covering, and gold (Ezek. 28:3–4, 13). The multitude of camels shall cover thee, all they from Sheba shall come, they shall bring gold and frankincense, and shall announce the praises of Jehovah (Isa. 60:6, 9; Matt. 2:11). I will fill this house with glory. The silver is mine, and the gold is mine; the glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former (Hag. 2:8–9). Kings’ daughters were among thy precious ones; upon thy right hand didstand the queen in the best gold of Ophir, her clothing was of woven gold (Ps. 45:9, 13; Ezek. 16:13). Thou hast taken the vessels of thy ornament of my gold and of my silver,which I had given thee, and madest to thyself images of a male (Ezek. 16:17).

Interior thought is in the light of heaven, and is called perception, and exterior thought is in the light of the world; and the understanding of every man is such that it can be elevated even into the light of heaven, and also is elevated, if from any delight he wishes to see truth. That this is so, has been given me to know by much experience, concerning which, wonderful things may be seen in Divine Providence; and still more in Divine Love and Wisdom. For the delight of love and wisdom elevates the thought, enabling one to see as in the light that a thing is so, although he had never heard it before. This light, which enlightens the mind, flows in from no other source than out of heaven from the Lord; and as they who will be of the new Jerusalem, will directly approach the Lord, that light will flow in, by the way of order, which is through the love of the will into the perception of the understanding."

This dogma the Reformed church has retained from the Roman Catholic religious persuasion, which declares that no one but the church itself, by which they mean the pope and papal consistory, ought to interpret the Word, and that he who does not in faith embrace all the doctrine delivered by the church is to be considered as a heretic, and is accursed. That this is the case is evident from a clause of the Council of Trent, in which all the dogmas of that religion are established, and where these words are at the end: “Then the president, Moronus, said, ‘Go in peace.’ There followed acclamations, and among others this declaration of the cardinal of Lorraine and the fathers: ‘We also believe, we are all of this very opinion, we all consenting and embracing subscribe to it; this is the faith of the blessed Peter and of the apostles, this is the faith of the fathers, this is the faith of the orthodox. So be it, amen, amen, anathema to all heretics, anathema, anathema.’” The decrees of that council are quoted in a summary at the beginning of this work, in which, indeed, there is scarcely a single truth. [3] These particulars are quoted to show that the Reformed have retained from that religious persuasion a blind faith, that is, a faith separated from the understanding; and they who do retain it henceforth cannot be enlightened in Divine truths from the Lord. So long as the understanding is held captive under obedience to faith, or so long as the understanding is removed from seeing the truths of the church, theology is only a thing of the memory, and a thing of the memory only is dissipated, like everything disunited from the judgment, and perishes from its obscurity. Hence it is that they are: Blind leaders of the blind. And when the blind lead the blind, both fall in to the ditch (Matt. 15:14).

Also the cornerstone which the builders rejected (Matt. 21:42; Mark 12:10–11; Luke 20:17–18). That the cornerstone is the foundation stone, appears from Jeremiah 51:26.

It is called one knowledge, although there are many which constitute that one knowledge; for the knowledge of the Lord is the universal of all things of doctrine and thence of all things of the church; from it all worship derives its life and soul, for the Lord is the all in all of heaven and the church, and thence in all things of worship. [2] The reason why the acknowledgment and knowledge of the Lord conjoins into one all the knowledges of truth and good from the Word is because there is a connection of all spiritual truths, and if you will believe it, their connection is like the connection of all the members, viscera, and organs of the body; wherefore as the soul contains all these in their order and connection, so that they are felt no otherwise than as one, so, in like manner, the Lord holds together all spiritual truths with man. That the Lord is the very gate, by which men are to enter into the church and thence into heaven, he himself teaches in John: I am the door; by me if anyone enter in, he shall be saved (John 10:9). And that the acknowledgment and knowledge of him is the pearl itself is meant by these words of the Lord in Matthew: The kingdom of the heavens is like unto a merchant seeking beautiful pearls, who when he had found one precious pearl, went and sold all that he had, and bought it (Matt. 13:45–46). “One precious pearl” is the acknowledgment and knowledge of the Lord."

Hence it is evident, that by “to walk in the light of the new Jerusalem” is signified to perceive and see Divine truths from interior enlightenment, and to live according to them. [2] But this must be illustrated, because it is not known who are here meant by “the nations” and who by “the kings” mentioned afterwards in this verse; by “the nations” are signified they who are in the good of love from the Lord, which good is called celestial good, and by “kings” are signified they who are in the truths of wisdom from spiritual good from the Lord, as will be seen in the next article. All they who are in celestial good from the Lord have Divine truths inscribed on their life, wherefore “they walk,” that is, live justly according to them and likewise see them inwardly in themselves, as the eye sees objects, on which subject see what is related above (n. 120–123). All the heavens are distinguished into two kingdoms, the celestial and the spiritual; the good of the celestial kingdom is called celestial good, which is the good of love to the Lord, and the good of the spiritual kingdom is called spiritual good, and is the good of wisdom, which in its essence is truth; concerning these two kingdoms see above (n. 647, 725, 854). [3] It is the same with the church; and there the men are celestial, who live justly according to the commandments because they are Divine laws, as in like manner a civil man lives according to the commandments of justice because they are civil laws; but the difference between them is that the former, by a life according to the commandments or laws, is a citizen of heaven as far as in himself he makes the civil laws, which are laws of justice, Divine"

And the kings of the earth shall bring their glory and honor into it signifies that all who are in the truths of wisdom from spiritual good will there confess the Lord, and ascribe to him every truth and every good that is with them. By “the kings of the earth” are signified they who are in truths from good from the Lord (n. 20, 854); here, therefore, they who are in the truths of wisdom from the good of spiritual love, because “the nations” are mentioned before, by which are signified they who are in the good of celestial love, of whom in the foregoing article; by “bringing glory and honor into it” or into the new Jerusalem, is signified to confess the Lord, and ascribe to him all the truth and good which are with them; that this is what is signified by bringing and giving “glory and honor” may be seen (n. 249, 629, 693), for “glory” is predicated of the Divine truth, and “honor” of the Divine good of the Lord (n. 249). By “nations and kings” the same is signified as by “nations and peoples” mentioned above (n. 483), by “nations” they who are in the good of love, and by “peoples” they who are in the truths of wisdom, and also in the opposite sense. Therefore in many parts of the Word “nations and kings” are mentioned, as well as “nations and peoples” as in the following passages: All kings shall bow down to him, and all nations shall serve him (Ps. 72:11). Thou shalt suck the milk of the nations, and thou shalt suck the breast of kings (Isa. 60:16). For many nations and great kings shall make them serve (Jer. 25:14). The Lord at thy right hand shall smite kings in the day of his anger, he shall judge among the nations (Ps. 110:5, 6), besides other places."

And the gates of it shall not be shut by day; for there shall be no night there signifies that they will be continually received into the new Jerusalem who are in truths from the good of love from the Lord, because there is not any falsity of faith there. By “its gates shall not be shut by day” is signified that they are continually admitted who desire to enter in. By “day” is signified continually, because there is always light there (as above, verses 11, 23), and “no night” as is said afterwards. The reason why they are continually received who are in truths from the good of love from the Lord is because the light of the new Jerusalem is truth from the good of love, and the good of love is from the Lord, as has been frequently shown above; and into that light no others can enter but they who are in truths from good from the Lord. If aliens enter, they are not received, because they do not agree, and they either depart of their own accord, because they cannot bear that light, or they are sent out. By “there is no night there” is signified that there is no falsity of faith; for by “night” is signified the opposite to light, and by “light” is signified truth from the good of love from the Lord, as was said; hence by “night” is signified that which is not from the good of love from the Lord, and this is the falsity of faith; the falsity of faith is also meant by “night” in John: Jesus said, I must work the works of him that sent me while it is day; the night cometh when no one can work (John 9:4). And in Luke: In that night there shall be two in one bed; the one shall be taken and the other left (Luke 17:34). It there treats of the last time of the church, when there will be nothing but falsity of faith; by “bed” is signified doctrine (n. 137). 923.

Hence it follows that by “they shall bring the glory and honor of the nations into it” is signified that they who enter in will bring with them the confession, acknowledgment, and faith that the Lord is the God of heaven and earth, and that all the truth of the church, and all the good of religion is with him. Nearly the same is signified by these things in Isaiah: I will extend peace over Jerusalem, the glory of the nations like a torrent (Isa. 66:12). It is said the truth of the church and the good of religion, because the church is one thing and religion is another. The church is called a church from doctrine, and religion is called religion from a life according to doctrine. All doctrine is called truth, and also its good is truth because it only teaches it; but the all of life according to the things which doctrine teaches is called good, likewise to do the truths of doctrine is good. This is the distinction between the church and religion. But yet where there is doctrine and not life, there it cannot be said that there is either the church or religion, because doctrine regards life as one with itself, just like truth and good, faith and charity, wisdom and love, understanding and will; wherefore where there is doctrine and not life, there is no church. 924. Verse 26. And there shall not enter into it any unclean thing and that doeth abomination, and a lie signifies that no one will be received into the Lord’s new church, which is the new Jerusalem, who adulterates the goods and falsifies the truths of the Word, and who does evils from confirmation and thus also falsifies. “Not to enter in” signifies not to be received, as above; by “unclean” is signified spiritual whoredom, which is adulteration of the good and"

By “doing abomination and a lie” is signified to do evils, and thus also falsities; by “abominations” are signified evils of all kinds, especially those which are named in the Decalogue (n. 891); and by “a lie” are signified falsities of all kinds, here falsities of evil, which in themselves are evils, therefore falsities confirming evil, which are the same with evils confirmed. [2] The reason why “a lie” signifies the falsity of doctrine is because a spiritual lie is nothing else; hence by “doing a lie” is signified to live according to falsities of doctrine. That “a lie” in the Word signifies falsity of doctrine may be evident from the following passages: We have made a covenant with death, and with hell have we made a vision; we have made a lie our trust, and in falsity have we hid ourselves (Isa. 28:15). They mock every man at his companion, and do not speak the truth, and have taught their tongue to speak a lie (Jer. 9:5) They are a rebellious people, lying sons, they will not hear the law of Jehovah (Isa. 30:9). Behold, I am against them that prophesy lying dreams; they tell them that they may seduce my people by their lies (Jer. 23:32). The diviners see a lie, and speak dreams of vanity (Zech. 10:2). They have seen vanity and the divination of a lie; because ye speak vanity and see a lie, therefore behold I am against you, that my hand may be against the prophets that speak a lie (Ezek. 13:6–9; 21:29). Woe to the city of bloods, it is all full of lies and robberies (Nahum 3:1). In the prophets of Jerusalem I have seen a horrible obduracy, committing adultery and walking in a lie (Jer. 23:14)."

When I was explaining the twentieth chapter, and was meditating about “the dragon” “the beast” and “the false prophet,” a certain one appeared to me, and asked, “What are you meditating upon?” I said that it was upon the false prophet. He then said to me, “I will lead you to the place where they are who are meant by the false prophet.” He said that they were the same as are meant (chapter 13) by “the beast out of the earth, which had two horns like a lamb, and spoke as a dragon.” I followed him, and behold, I saw a multitude, in the midst of which were leaders, who taught that nothing else saves man but faith; and that works are good, but not for salvation; and that still they are to be taught from the Word, that the laity, especially the simple, may be held the more strictly in the bonds of obedience to the magistrates, and as from religion, and thus interiorly, may be compelled to exercise moral charity. [2] And then one of them, seeing me, said, “Do you wish to see our shrine, in which there is an image representative of our faith?” I drew near, and saw; and behold, it was magnificent, and in the midst of it an image of a woman, clothed in a scarlet garment, and holding a golden coin in the right hand; and in the left a chain of pearls.

But when I noticed that they were such sorceries, I prayed to the Lord, and suddenly the interiors of my mind were opened; and I then saw in place of the magnificent shrine a house full of chinks, from the roof to the bottom, in which nothing cohered; and instead of a woman I saw hanging in that house an image, the head of which was like a dragon’s, the body like a leopard’s, and the feet like a bear’s, thus like the description of the beast out of the sea (Rev. 13); and instead of the ground was a swamp, in which was a multitude of frogs; and it was said to me that under that swamp was a great hewn stone, beneath which lay the Word well concealed. [3] On seeing these things, I said to the sorcerer, “Is this your shrine?” and he said that it was. But suddenly his interior sight was then opened, and he saw the same things that I did; on seeing which he cried out with a great cry, “What is this, and whence is this?” And I said that it is from the light of heaven, which discloses the quality of every form, and here the quality of your faith separated from spiritual charity. And immediately there came an east wind, and carried away everything that was there, and also dried up the swamp, and thus laid bare the stone, under which lay the Word. And after this there breathed as it were a vernal heat from heaven; and behold, there then appeared in the same place a tabernacle, simple in its external form. And the angels who were with me said, “Behold, the tabernacle of Abraham, such as it was when the three angels came to him, and announced that Isaac was to be born. This appears before the eyes as simple, but it becomes more and more magnificent according to the influx of light from heaven.” And it was given them to open the heaven in which were the spiritual angels, who are in wisdom; and then, from the light flowing in thence, that tabernacle appeared like a temple similar to that at Jerusalem. When I looked into it, I saw the foundation stone, under which the Word had been deposited, set around with precious stones; from which as it were lightning flashed upon the walls, upon which were the forms of cherubim, and beautifully variegated them with colors."

But because a holiness then filled the interiors of the minds of the angels, by which there was an impulse to fall down upon their faces, suddenly the way of the light from the third heaven was closed by the Lord, and the way was opened for the light from the second heaven; in consequence of which the former appearance of the temple returned, and likewise of the tabernacle, but in the temple. By this was illustrated the meaning of these words in this chapter: Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them (Rev. 21:3, n. 882); and by these: I saw no temple in the new Jerusalem; for the Lord God almighty is the temple of it, and the lamb (Rev. 21:22, n. 918)."

For they who do not go immediately to the Lord cannot be conjoined to him, and thus neither to the Father, and hence cannot be in the love which is from the Divine; for the looking to him conjoins, not a mere intellectual looking, but an intellectual looking from the affection of the will; and affection of the will is not given, unless man keeps his commandments; wherefore the Lord says: He that doeth my commandments, he it is that loveth me; and I will come unto him, and make an abode with him (John 14:21–24). [3] It is said, in the inmosts of the truths of doctrine and thence of life in the new church, because in spiritual things all things are and all things proceed from the inmost, as from fire and light in the center to the circumferences; or as from the sun, which is also in the center, heat and light flow into the universe; it takes place thus in the least things as in the greatest. Because the inmost of all truth is signified, it is therefore said, “in the midst of the street and of the river,” and not on both sides of the river, although this is meant. That from the Lord, when he is in the inmost, all the goods of love and charity are and proceed, is manifest from the words of the Lord himself in John: Jesus said, As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine, so neither can ye, except ye abide in me. I am the vine, ye are the branches; he that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit; for without me ye cannot do anything (John 15:4–6). 934. That “fruits” signify the goods which man does from love or charity is known indeed without confirmation from the Word; for the reader understands nothing else by “fruits” in the Word.

Either make the tree good and the fruit good, or else make the tree corrupt and the fruit corrupt; the tree is known from the fruit (Matt. 12:33; Luke 6:43–44). Every branch that beareth not fruit shall be taken away, but everyone that beareth fruit shall be pruned, that it may bring forth more fruit; he that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit (John 15:2–8). Make fruits worthy of repentance (Matt. 3:8). That which was sowed in the good ground is he that heareth the Word, and attendeth, and beareth fruit (Matt. 13:23). Jesus said to the disciples, I have chosen you, that ye should bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain (John 15:16). A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard. He came seeking fruit on it, and found none; he saith to the vinedresser, Cut it down, why maketh it the earth unfruitful? (Luke 13:6–9) A man, a householder, let out his vineyard to husbandmen, to receive the fruits of it; but they killed the servants sent to them, and at length his son; hetherefore will let out the vineyard to others, who will render him the fruits in their seasons.

But it shall be told how it is to be understood, that the Lord produces the goods of charity with a man according to the state of truth with him. He who believes that a man does good that is acceptable to the Lord, which is called spiritual good, unless there are truths from the Word in him, is much deceived. Goods without truths are not goods, and truths without goods are not truths with man, although in themselves they may be truths; for good without truth is like the voluntary of man without the understanding, which voluntary is not human, but is like a beast’s, or like that of a carved image which an artificer causes to operate. But the voluntary together with the intellectual becomes human according to the state of the understanding by which it exists. For the state of life of every man is such that his will cannot do anything except through the understanding, nor can the understanding think anything except from the will. It is similar with good and truth, since good is of the will, and truth is of the understanding. [2] It is manifest from this, that the good which the Lord produces with man is according to the state of the truth with him from which is his understanding. That this is signified by “the tree of life yielding its fruit every month” is because the state of truth with man is signified by month. That states of life are signified by all times, which are hours, days, weeks, months, years, ages, may be seen (n. 476, 562). That states of life as to truths are signified by “months” is because the times determined by the moon are meant by “months,” and truth of the understanding and of faith is signified by “the moon” (n. 332, 413, 414, 919). Similar things are meant by months in these passages: Blessed of Jehovah is the land of Joseph for the precious things of the produce of the sun, and for the precious things of the produce of the months (Deut. 33:13–14).

And then also they sounded with the trumpets (Num. 10:10; Ps. 81:3). And it was commanded that they should observe the month Abib, in which they celebrated the Passover (Exod. 12:2; Deut. 16:1). States of truth are signified by “months,” and in the opposite sense states of falsity with man, in Revelation above (also chap. 9:5, 10, 15; 11:2; 13:5). The same is signified by month (Ezek. 47:12). 936.

By “the leaves of the tree” are signified rational truths, of which below. By “the nations” are signified those who are in goods and thence in truths, and in the opposite sense those who are in evils and thence in falsities (n. 483); here they who are in evils and thence in falsities, because it is said, “for their medicine”; and they who are in evils and thence in falsities cannot be healed by the Word, because they do not read it; but if they have sound judgment, they can be healed by rational truths. Things similar to those in this verse are signified by these words in Ezekiel: Behold, waters went forth from under the threshold from which was a river, upon whose bank on this side and on that were very many trees for food, whose leaf falleth not, nor is consumed; it is renewed every month, whence its fruit is for food, and its leaf for medicine (Ezek. 47:1, 7, 12). There also the new church is treated of. That rational truths are signified by “leaves” is because by “a tree” is signified man (n. 83, 400); and then by all the parts of a tree are signified corresponding things in man; as by the branches, leaves, flowers, fruits, and seeds.

[2] That rational truths are signified by “the leaves” is clearly manifest from the things seen in the spiritual world; for trees appear there also, with leaves and fruits; there are gardens and paradises from them. With those who are in the goods of love and at the same time in the truths of wisdom there appear fruit-bearing trees, luxuriant with beautiful leaves, but with those who are in the truths of some wisdom, and speak from reason, and are not in the goods of love, there appear trees full of leaves, but without fruits; but with those with whom there are neither goods nor the truths of wisdom, there do not appear trees, unless stripped of their leaves, as in the time of winter in the world. A man not rational is nothing else but such a tree. [3] Rational truths are those which proximately receive spiritual truths, for the rational of man is the first receptacle of spiritual truths; for the perception of truth in some form is in man’s rational, which the man himself does not see in thought, as he does the things which are beneath the rational in the lower thought, which conjoins itself with the external sight. Rational truths are also signified by “leaves” (Gen. 3:7; 8:11; Isa. 34:4; Jer. 8:13; 17:8; Ezek. 47:12; Dan. 4:12, 14; Ps. 1:3; Lev. 26:36; Matt. 21:19; 24:32; Mark 13:28). But their signification is according to the species of the trees. The leaves of the olive and the vine signify rational truths from celestial and spiritual light; the leaves of the fig rational truths from natural light; and the leaves of the fir, the poplar, the oak, the pine, rational truths from sensual light. The leaves of these strike terror in the spiritual world, when they are shaken by a strong wind; these are meant in Lev. 26:36; Job 13:55. But it is not so with the leaves of the former. 937.

By “accursed thing” in the Word is meant all that evil and falsity which separates man and turns him away from the Lord; for then the man becomes a devil and a satan. By “the throne of God and of the lamb shall be in it” is signified that the Lord himself will reign in that church; for by “a throne” is here signified a kingdom; and the Lord’s kingdom is where he alone is worshiped. By “his servants shall minister unto him” is signified that they who are in truths from the Lord through the Word will be with him, and will do his commandments because conjoined with him.

And if one also loves another whom he knows, he dwells with him in one society; and if he loves him inmostly, in one house. This is the state of all in the whole spiritual world; and this state of all derives its origin from this, that the Lord is present with everyone according to faith, and is conjoined according to love. Faith and thence the Lord’s presence are given through the knowledges of truths from the Word; especially concerning the Lord himself there; but love and thence conjunction are given through a life according to his commandments, for the Lord says: He that hath my commandments, and doeth them, he it is that loveth me; and I will love him; and will make an abode with him (John 14:21–24). [3] But how this is done shall also be told. The Lord loves everyone, and wills to be conjoined to him, but he cannot be conjoined as long as the man is in the delight of evil, as in the delight of hating and revenging, in the delight of committing adultery and whoredom, in the delight of robbing or stealing under any form, in the delight of blaspheming and lying, and in the lusts of the love of self and the world; for everyone who is in these is in companionship with the devils who are in hell. The Lord indeed loves them even there; but he cannot be conjoined with them, unless the delights of those evils are removed; and these cannot be removed by the Lord, unless the man examines himself that he may know his evils, acknowledges and confesses them before the Lord, and wills to desist from them, and thus perform repentance. This the man must do as of himself, because he does not feel that he does anything from the Lord; and this is given to man, because conjunction, that it may be conjunction, must be reciprocal, of man with the Lord, and of the Lord with man. As far therefore as evils with their delights are thus removed, so far the Lord’s love enters, which, as was said, is universal towards all; and man is then led away from hell, and is led into heaven. This a man must do in the world; for such as man is in the world as to his spirit, such he remains to eternity, with the difference only, that his state becomes"

And they shall see his face, and his name shall be in their foreheads signifies that they will turn themselves to the Lord, and the Lord will turn himself to them, because they are conjoined through love. By “seeing the face of God and of the lamb,” or the Lord, is not meant to see his face, because no one can see his face, as he is in his Divine love and in his Divine wisdom, and live; for he is the sun of heaven and of the whole spiritual world. For to see his face, such as he is in himself, would be as if one should enter into the sun, by the fire of which he would be consumed in a moment. But the Lord sometimes presents himself to be seen out of his sun; but he then veils himself and presents himself to their sight, which is done through an angel; as he also did in the world before Abraham, Hagar, Lot, Gideon, Joshua, and others; wherefore those angels were called angels, and also Jehovah; for the presence of Jehovah was in them from afar. [2] But by “they shall see his face” is not here meant to thus see his face, but to see the truths which are in the Word from him, and through them to know and acknowledge him. For the Divine truths of the Word make the light which proceeds from the Lord as a sun, in which the angels are; and as they make the light, they are like mirrors in which the Lord’s face is seen. That by “seeing the Lord’s face” is signified to turn oneself to him, will be told below. By “the Lord’s name in their foreheads” is signified that the Lord loves them, and turns them to himself. By “the Lord’s name” the Lord himself is signified, because all his quality by which he is known and according to which he is worshiped is signified (n. 81, 584); and by “the forehead” is signified love (n. 347, 605); and by “written in the forehead” is signified the love of the Lord in them (n. 729); from this it may be evident what is properly signified by those words.

By which is signified that those are continually received into the new Jerusalem, who are in truths from the good of love from the Lord, because there is no falsity of faith there (n. 922). By “they have no need of a lamp and of the light of the sun, because the Lord God giveth them light” the same is signified as above (chap. 21), where are these things: The city had no need of the sun and of the moo n to shine in it, for the glory of God did lighten it, and the lamp thereof is the lamb (Rev. 21:23); by which is signified that the men of that church will not be in the love of self and in their own intelligence, and thence in natural light alone, but in spiritual light from the Divine truth of the Word from the Lord alone (n. 919). But instead of “the moon” it is here said “a lamp”; and instead of “the sun” there, “the light of the sun” is here spoken of; and by “the moon,” as by “a lamp,” natural light from one’s own intelligence is signified; and by “the light of the sun” is signified natural light from the glory arising from pride. [2] But it shall be explained in few words what natural light from the glory arising from pride is. There is given natural light from glory arising from pride, and also not from pride. Those have light from the glory arising from pride, who are in the love of self, and thence in evils of every kind; and if they do not do them from fear of the loss of reputation, and if they likewise condemn them because they are against morality and against the public good, they still do not repute them as sins. These are in natural light from the glory arising from pride, for the love of self in the will becomes pride in the understanding; and this pride from that love can elevate the understanding even into the light of heaven. This is given to man, that he may be a man, and that he may be capable of being reformed. I have seen and heard many who were in the highest degree devils, who understood as the angels themselves do,"

But natural light from glory that is not from pride is with those who are in the delight of uses from genuine love towards the neighbor. The natural light of these is also rational light, within which there is spiritual light from the Lord; the glory with them is from the brightness of the inflowing light from heaven where all things are splendid and harmonious, for all uses in heaven are resplendent. From these uses the pleasantness in the ideas of the thought with such is perceived as glory. It enters through the will and its goods, into the understanding and its truths, and in the latter becomes manifest. 941.

[2] The reason why by “an angel” is here signified heaven is because the Lord spoke with John through heaven, and through heaven he also spoke with the prophets, and through heaven he speaks with everyone with whom he speaks. The reason is that the angelic heaven in general is as one man, whose soul and life is the Lord; wherefore all that the Lord speaks he speaks through heaven, just as the soul and mind of man speak through his body. That the whole angelic heaven in one complex relates to one man, and that this is from the Lord, may be seen above (n. 5), and in Heaven and Hell, published at London, 1758 (n. 59–86), and in Divine Providence (n. 64–69, 162–164, 201–204), and in Divine Love and Wisdom (n. 11, 19, 133, 288). [3] But I will explain this mystery; the Lord speaks through heaven, but still the angels there do not speak, nor do they indeed know what the Lord speaks, unless some of them are with the man through whom the Lord speaks openly from heaven, as with John and some of the prophets; for there is an influx of the Lord through heaven, just as there is an influx of the soul through the body. The body indeed speaks and acts, and also feels something from influx, but still the body does nothing from itself as from itself, but is acted upon. That such is the speech, yea, all the influx of the Lord through heaven with men, has been given me to know from much experience. The angels of heaven, and also the spirits under the heavens, know nothing concerning man, as man knows nothing concerning them; because the state of spirits and angels is spiritual, and the state of men is natural, which two states are consociated solely by correspondences, and consociation by correspondences does indeed cause them to be together in affections, but not in thoughts; wherefore one does not know anything of the other, that is, man does not know anything of the spirits with whom he is consociated as to affections, nor do spirits know anything of man,"

[2] He who considers may see that to keep the words of the prophecy of this book is not what is meant, but that what is signified is to keep, that is, to observe and do the truths or precepts of doctrine, which are now opened and explained in this book. For in Revelation, when not explained, there are but few things that can be kept, for they are prophecies heretofore not understood. For example take the following: the things cannot be kept which are recorded in chapter 6 concerning the horses going forth from the book; in chapter 7 concerning the twelve tribes; in chapter 8 and 9 concerning the seven angels that sounded their trumpets; in chapter 10 concerning the little book that was eaten up by John; in chapter 11 concerning the two witnesses which were slain and revived; in chapter 12 concerning the woman and the dragon; in chapter 13 and 14 concerning the two beasts; in chapter 15 and 16 concerning the seven angels that had the seven plagues; in chapter 17 and 18 concerning the woman that sat upon the scarlet beast, and concerning Babylon; in chapter 19 concerning the white horse and"

Verse 8. And I John saw these things and heard them. And when I heard and saw, I fell down to adore before the feet of the angel who showed me these things signifies that John thought that the angel who was sent to him by the Lord to keep him in a state of the spirit, was God who revealed these things, when nevertheless it was not so; for the angel only showed what the Lord made manifest. That John thought that the angel who was sent to him was God himself is evident; for it is said, that he fell down to adore him at his feet; but that this was not the case, appears from the next verse, where the angel says that he was his fellow servant, and to “adore God”; that the angel was sent to him by the Lord, appears from verse 16, where are these words, “I, Jesus, have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches.” But the arcanum that lies hidden in these words is this: an angel was sent by the Lord to John, that he might be kept in a state of the spirit, and in that state he might show him the things which he saw. For what John saw, he did not see with the eyes of his body, but with the eyes of his spirit, as may appear from the passages where he says he was “in the spirit” and “in vision” (chapter 1:10; 9:17; 17:3; 21:10); thus everywhere when he says “he saw”; and no one can come into that state, and be kept in it, but by angels, who are closely adjoined to man, and who induce their spiritual state on the interiors of his mind, for thus man is elevated into the light of heaven, and in that light he sees the things which are in heaven, and not those which are in the world. [ 2] In a similar state at times were Ezekiel, Zechariah, Daniel, and others of the prophets; but not when they spoke the Word; for then they were not in the spirit but in the body, and heard the words which they wrote from Jehovah himself, that is, from the"

The prophets themselves carefully distinguished them; for they say everywhere when they wrote the Word from Jehovah that Jehovah spoke with them and to them, and very often Jehovah said, “the saying of Jehovah”; but when they were in the other state, they say that “they were in the spirit” or “in vision,” as may appear from the following passages. It is said in Ezekiel: The spirit lifted me up, and brought me in a vision of God, into Chaldea to the captivity; so the vision that I saw went up upon me (Ezek. 11:1, 24). He says that: The spirit lifted him up, and he heard behind him an earthquake, and other things (Ezek. 3:12, 14). The spirit lifted him up between heaven and earth, and brought him in the visions of God to Jerusalem, and he saw abominations (Ezek. 8:3 seq.). Wherefore in like manner in a vision of God or in the spirit: He saw four animals which were cherubs (Ezek. 1, 10). Also a new temple and a new earth, and an angel measuring them (Ezek. chapter 40–48). That he was then in “the visions of God,” he says in chapter 40:2; and that the spirit lifted him up (chapter 43). [3] It was the same with Zechariah: With whom there was an angel, when he saw a man riding among the myrtle trees (Zech. 1:8 seq.).

It was the same with John when he saw the things which he has described, as when he saw the son of man in the midst of the seven lampstands; the tabernacle, the temple, ark, and altar in heaven; the dragon and his combat with Michael, the beasts, the woman sitting on the scarlet beast; the new heaven and the new earth, and the holy Jerusalem with its wall, gates, and foundations, and more.

You may experience this and thus be confirmed, if you will, by only attending to your thoughts; when you will also be convinced that thought is higher and lower, inasmuch as simple thought cannot survey itself, except from some higher thought; and if man did not have a higher and a lower thought, he would not be a man but a brute. [3] The reason why by “seal not the words of this prophecy” is signified that Revelation must not be shut, but opened, is because by “sealing” is signified to shut, and therefore by “not sealing” is signified to open, and by “the time is at hand” is signified that it is necessary; for Revelation is a sealed or closed book, so long as it is not explained; and as is shown above (n. 944), by “the words of this prophecy” are meant the truths and precepts of doctrine of this book opened by the Lord. That this is necessary at the end of the church that any may be saved, may be seen above (n. 9).

By “unjust” is signified he who is in evils, and by “just” he who is in goods (n. 668); by “filthy” or unclean is signified he who is in falsities (n. 702, 708, 924), and by “holy” is signified he who is in truths (n. 173, 586, 666, 852); hence it follows that by “he that is unjust, let him be unjust still” is signified that he who is in evils will be still more in evils, and that by “he that is filthy, let him be filthy still” is signified that he who is in falsities will be still more in falsities; and, on the other hand, that by “he that is just, let him be just still” is signified that he who is in goods will be still more in goods, and by “he that is holy, let him be holy still” is signified that he who is in truths will be still more in truths. But the reason why it signifies that from those who are in evils goods will be taken away, and from those who are in falsities truths will be taken away, and that, on the contrary, from those who are in goods evils will be taken away, and from those who are in truths falsities will be taken away, is because as far as goods are taken away from anyone who is in evils, so much the more is he in evils, and as far as truths are taken away from anyone who is in falsities, so much the more he is in falsities, and, on the other hand, as far as evils are taken away from anyone who is in goods, so much the more is he in goods, and as far as falsities are taken away from anyone who is in truths, so much the more is he in truths; either the one or the other happens to everyone after death, for thus the evil are prepared for hell and the good for heaven; for the evil cannot carry with them goods and truths into hell, neither can the good carry evils and falsities into heaven, for this would be to confuse both heaven and hell together. [ 2] But it should be clearly known that they are meant who are interiorly evil and interiorly good; for they who are interiorly evil may be exteriorly good, for they can act and speak like the good, as hypocrites do; and they who are interiorly good may sometimes be exteriorly evil, for they may exteriorly do evils, and speak falsities,"

Thus it happens with all after death before the judgment upon them; it also came to pass in general with those, who either perished or were saved at the day of the last judgment, for before this happened, the last judgment could not be executed, by reason that so long as the evil retained goods and truths, they were conjoined with the angels of the lowest heaven as to externals, and nevertheless they were to be separated; and this is what was foretold by the Lord (Matt. 13:24–30, 38–40), which may be seen explained above (n. 324, 329, 343, 346, 398). From these considerations it may be seen what is signified in the spiritual sense by “he that is unjust, let him be unjust still; and he that is filthy, let him be filthy still; and he that is just, let him be just still; and he that is holy, let him be holy still.” The following passage in Daniel has a like signification: Go, Daniel; for the words are closed up and sealed to the time of the end.

That good works are charity and faith in internals, and at the same time their effects in externals, may be seen above (n. 641, 868, 871). [2] That charity and faith are not from man, but from the Lord, is known; and because they are from the Lord they are according to conjunction with him, and conjunction with him is effected by faith in him and by a life according to his commandments. By faith in him is meant confidence that he will save, and they have this confidence who immediately approach him, and shun evils as sins; with others it is not given. It was said that “my reward is with me” signifies that he himself is heaven and the felicity of eternal life, for “reward” is intrinsic beatitude, which is called peace, and thence external joy. These are solely from the Lord, and the things which are from the Lord, not only are from him, but also are himself, for the Lord cannot send forth anything from himself except it be himself, for he is omnipresent with every man according to conjunction, and conjunction is according to reception, and reception is according to love and wisdom, or if you will, according to charity and faith, and charity and faith are according to life, and life is according to the aversion to evil and falsity, and aversion to evil and falsity is according to the knowledge of what is evil and false, and then according to repentance, and at the same time looking to the Lord. [3] That “reward” not only is from the Lord but also is the Lord himself appears from those passages in the Word where it is said that they who are conjoined with him are in him and he in them, as may be seen in John (14:20–24; 15:4–5 seq.; 17:19, 21–22, 26, and in other places), see above (n. 883) and also where it is said that the Holy Spirit is in them; and the Holy Spirit is the Lord, for it is his Divine presence; and also when he prays that God will"

That they who are in the Lord and the Lord in them are in all power, insomuch that whatsoever they will, they can do, the Lord himself says in John: He that abideth in me and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit; for without me ye can do nothing; if ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you (John 15:5, 7). In like manner concerning power (Matt. 7:7; Mark 11:24; Luke 11:9–10); yea, in Matthew: Jesus said, If ye have faith, ye shall say to this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; it shall be done. And all things whatsoever ye shall ask believing, ye shall receive (Matt. 21:21–22). By these words is described the power of those who are in the Lord; these do not will anything, and so do not ask anything, but from the Lord, and whatsoever they will and ask from the Lord, the same is done, for the Lord says, “Without me ye can do nothing, abide in me and I in you”; such power have the angels in heaven, that if they only will a thing, they obtain it; but yet they do not will anything but what is of use, and this they will as if from themselves, but still from the Lord. 952.

[2] By “dogs” in general are signified they who are in all kinds of lusts, and indulge them, particularly they who are in pleasures merely corporeal, especially in the pleasure of eating and drinking, in which alone they take delight; for which reason dogs, in the spiritual world, appear from those who have indulged their appetite and palate, and are there called corporeal appetites; such, because they are gross in mind, make no account of the things which are of the church; therefore it is said that they shall stand without, that is, shall not be received into the Lord’s new church. [3] “Dogs” have a similar signification in the following passages in the Word: His watchmen are blind; they are all dumb dogs; gazing, lying down, loving to slumber, dogs hardened in soul, they know not satiety (Isa. 56:10–11). They make a noise like dogs, and go round about the city. They wander for food, and if they be not satisfied, they thus pass the night (Ps. 59:6, 14–15).

He is called “the bright star” from the light with which he came into the world, wherefore he is likewise called “star,” and also “light”; “a star” (Num. 24:17), and “light” (John 1:4–12; 3:19, 21; 9:5; 12:35–36, 46; Matt. 4:16; Luke 2:30–32; Isa. 9:2; 49:6).

By “the spirit” is signified heaven, by “the bride” the church, and by “saying, Come” is signified to desire the Lord’s coming. That the new church, which is the holy Jerusalem, is meant by “the bride” is evident (from chapter 21:2, 9–10) (see n. 881, 895); and that by “the spirit” is meant heaven, is, because the angelic spirits are meant, of whom the new heaven is to be formed, concerning whom above (chapter 14:1–7; 19:1–9; 20:4–5). By the church, which is here called “the bride” is not meant the church consisting of those who are in falsities of faith, but the church consisting of those who are in truths of faith, for these desire light, consequently the Lord’s coming, as above (n. 954). 956.

By “let him that heareth say, Come” is signified he who hears and thence knows anything of the Lord’s coming, and of the new heaven and the new church, thus of the Lord’s kingdom, let him pray that it may come; by “him that thirsteth, let him say, Come” is signified he who desires the Lord’s kingdom, and, at the same time, truths, let him pray that the Lord may come with light; by “him that willeth let him take of the water of life freely” is signified that he who from love is willing to learn truths and appropriate them to himself, will receive them from the Lord without any work of his own; by “willing” is signified to love, because that which a man wills from his heart he loves, and that which he loves the same he wills from the heart; by “the water of life” is signified Divine truths"

Everyone that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, buy wine and milk without silver (Isa. 55:1). Jesus cried, saying, If anyone thirst, let him come unto me and drink; whosoever believeth in me, out of his belly shall flow streams of living water (John 7:37–38).

That “plagues” signify the falsities and evils which those have who adore the beast of the dragon, and the false prophet, may be seen (n. 456, 657, 673, 676–677, 683, 690–691, 699, 708, 718); the beast of the dragon, and the false prophet are they who make faith alone without good works saving. [2] There are two things in this prophetic book, to which all its contents refer; the first is, that no other God is to be acknowledged but the Lord, and the other, that no other faith is to be acknowledged but faith in the Lord; he who knows these, and yet adds anything with intent to destroy them, cannot be otherwise than in falsities and evils, and must perish from them, because from no other God but the Lord, and by no other faith but faith in the Lord, is given the good which is of love, and the truth which is of faith, and thence the felicity of eternal life, as the Lord himself teaches in many places in the evangelists, see above (n. 553).

By which is signified, that the Lord will come in his Divine human, and give eternal life to those who acknowledge him; wherefore these words follow likewise in a series: “He which testifieth these things, saith, Surely, I come quickly. Amen. Even so come, Lord Jesus” (verse 20); from which it is plain that nothing else is meant. “To add” is also a prophetic word signifying to destroy (as in Ps. 120:2, and in other places). From these things the signification of this and the following verse may be seen. 958. Verse 19. And if anyone shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and the things which are written in this book signifies that they who read and know the truths of doctrine in this book, now opened by the Lord, and yet acknowledge any other God than the Lord, and any other faith than a faith in him, by taking away anything whereby they may destroy these two things, cannot acquire any wisdom, nor appropriate to themselves anything from the Word, nor be received into the new Jerusalem, nor have their lot with those who are in the Lord’s kingdom. These words signify the same as the foregoing, only that here it is said of those who take away, and there of those who add, consequently of those who either by adding or taking away, destroy those two truths. “To take away their part out of the book of life” signifies that they cannot acquire any wisdom from the Word, nor appropriate anything out of it to themselves. “The book of life” is the Word, and also the Lord as to the Word (n. 256, 469, 874, 925). The reason is because the Lord is the Word, for the Word treats of him alone, as is fully shown in the two doctrines of the new Jerusalem, Doctrine of the Lord, and Doctrine of the Sacred Scripture; wherefore they who do not immediately approach the Lord cannot see any truth from the Word. “To take away their part out of the holy city” signifies out of the new church, which is the holy Jerusalem; for no one is received into it who does not approach the Lord alone. “To take away their part out of the things which are written in this book” signifies not to have their lot with"

That it may be known that by these words is not meant he who “takes away from the words of this book” as it is written in the literal sense, but he who takes away from the truths of doctrine which are in its spiritual sense, I will explain whence this is: the Word, which was dictated by the Lord, passed through the heavens of his celestial kingdom, and the heavens of his spiritual kingdom, and thus came to the man through whom it was written; wherefore the Word in its first origin is purely Divine. This Word, as it passed through the heavens of the Lord’s celestial kingdom, was Divine celestial, and as it passed through the heavens of the Lord’s spiritual kingdom, was Divine spiritual, and when it came to man, it became Divine natural. Hence it is that the natural sense of the Word contains in itself the spiritual sense, and this the celestial sense, and both a sense purely Divine, which does not appear to any man nor indeed to any angel. These things are adduced that it may be seen that by “not adding nor taking away” anything from what is written in Revelation is meant in heaven, that not anything is to be added or taken away from the truths of doctrine concerning the Lord and concerning faith in him. For it is this sense, and truth concerning life according to his commandments, from which is the sense of the letter, as has been said. 960. Verse 20. He who testifieth these things saith, Surely, I come quickly. Amen. Yea, come, Lord Jesus signifies the Lord, who revealed Revelation, and has now opened it, testifying this gospel, that he comes in his Divine human, which he took upon him in the world and glorified, as the bridegroom and husband, and that the church desires him, as the bride and wife. The Lord said above, “I, Jesus, have sent my angel to testify unto you these things in the churches” (verse 16 of this chapter); it may be seen above (n. 953) that this signifies a testification by the Lord before the whole Christian world, that it is true that the Lord alone manifested the things which are written in this book, and which are now laid open."

The reason why it means testifying this gospel is because he here declares his coming, his kingdom, and his spiritual marriage with the church; for he says, “Surely, I come quickly. Amen. Yea, come, Lord Jesus”; and by “the gospel” is signified the Lord’s coming to his kingdom (n. 478, 553, 626, 664). The reason why he here comes to a spiritual marriage with the church is because this new church is called the bride and wife, and the Lord its bridegroom and husband, above (chapters 19:7–9; 20:2, 9, 10; 21:17); and here at the end of the book, the Lord speaks and the church speaks, as the bridegroom and the bride; the Lord speaks these words, “Surely, I come quickly. Amen”; and the church speaks these, “Yea, come, Lord Jesus,” which are words of betrothing to the spiritual marriage. That the Lord will come in his Divine human, which he assumed and glorified in the world, is plain from this, that he names himself “Jesus,” and says that he is “the root and the offspring of David” (verse 16), and that the church here says, “Come, Lord Jesus,” see above (n. 953, 954). 961. To this I will add two relations. The first is this. Once on waking from sleep, I fell into a profound meditation concerning God; and when I looked up, I saw above me in heaven a very bright light in an oval form; and when I fixed my attention on that light, it receded to the sides, and entered into the circumference. And then behold, heaven was opened to me, and I saw some magnificent things, and angels standing in the form of a circle on the southern side of the opening, speaking with one another. And because I was enkindled with the desire of hearing what they were saying, it was therefore given me first to hear the sound, which was full of heavenly love, and afterwards their speech, which was full of wisdom from that love. They were talking with one another of the one God, of conjunction with him, and of salvation thence. They spoke ineffable things, the most of which cannot be expressed by any natural language. But as I had many times been in consociation with angels in heaven itself, and then in similar speech with them, because in a similar state, I could therefore now understand them,"

[2] They said that the Divine esse is one, the same, the itself, and indivisible; thus also the Divine essence, because the Divine esse is the Divine essence; and thus also God, because the Divine essence, which is also the Divine esse, is God. They illustrated this by spiritual ideas, saying that the Divine esse cannot fall into many, every one of which has the Divine esse, and yet be one, the same, itself, and indivisible; for each would think from his esse from himself and by himself; if he should at the same time also think from the others and by the others unanimously, there would be many unanimous gods, and not one God. For unanimity, as it is the consent of many, and at the same time of each one from himself, and by himself, does not agree with the unity of God, but with a plurality, they did not say of gods, because they could not; for the light of heaven, from which was their thought, and in which their discourse proceeded, resisted. They also said, that when they want to speak of “gods,” and each one of them as a person by himself, the effort of utterance spontaneously falls into “one,” indeed, into “the only God.” [3] To this they added that the Divine esse is the Divine esse in itself, not from itself; because from itself supposes an esse in itself, from which it is, and thus supposes a God from God, which is not given. That which is from God is not called God, but is called the Divine; for what is a God from God; and thus what is a God from God born from eternity; and what is a God from God proceeding through a God born from eternity, but words in which there is not the least light from heaven? It is otherwise in the Lord Jesus Christ; in him is the Divine esse itself from which all things are, to which the soul in man corresponds, the Divine human, to which the body in man corresponds, and the Divine proceeding, to which activity in man corresponds.

That the Divine esse, which is God in himself, is the itself they illustrated thus. God is the itself, because he is love itself, wisdom itself, good itself, truth itself, life itself; which unless they were the itself in God, would not be anything in heaven and in the world; because there would not be anything of them having relation to the itself. Every quality derives its quality from this, that there is an itself from which it is, and to which it has relation, that it may be such. This itself, which is the Divine esse, is not in place, but is with those and in those who are in place, according to reception; since of love and wisdom, and of good and truth, which are the itself in God, yea, are God himself, place cannot be predicated, or progression from place to place, but without place, whence is omnipresence. Wherefore the Lord says, that “he is in the midst of them”; also “he in them, and they in him.” [5] But because he cannot be received by anyone as he is in himself, he appears as he is in himself as the sun above the angelic heavens, the proceeding from which as light is himself as to wisdom, and as heat is himself as to love. He himself is not the sun; but the Divine love and Divine wisdom going forth from himself proximately, round about himself, appear before the angels as the sun. He himself in the sun is a man, he is our Lord Jesus Christ both as to the Divine from which, and as to the Divine human; since the itself, which is love itself and wisdom itself, was his soul from the Father, and thus the Divine life, which is life in itself. It is otherwise in every man; in him the soul is not life, but a recipient of life. The Lord also teaches this, saying:"

They added to this, that he who is in any spiritual light, can perceive that the Divine esse, which is also the Divine essence, because it is one, the same, the itself, and thence indivisible, cannot be given in many; and that if it were said to be given, manifest contradictions would follow. [6] After hearing these things, the angels perceived in my thought the common ideas of the Christian church concerning a trinity of persons in unity and their unity in trinity, respecting God, as also concerning the birth of a son of God from eternity; and they then said, “What are you thinking of? Are you not thinking those things from natural light, with which our spiritual light does not agree? Wherefore, unless you remove the ideas of that thought, we close heaven to you, and go away.” But I then said to them, “Enter, I pray, more deeply into my thought and perhaps you will see agreement.” And they did so, and saw that by three persons I understand three proceeding Divine attributes, which are creation, salvation, and reformation; and that these attributes are of the one God; and that by the birth of a son of God from eternity I understood his birth foreseen from eternity and provided in time. And I then related that my natural thought concerning a trinity and unity of persons, and concerning the birth of a son of God from eternity, I received from the doctrine of faith of the church, which has its name from Athanasius; and that that doctrine is just and right, provided that instead of a trinity of persons there be there understood a trinity of person, which is given only in the Lord Jesus Christ; and instead of the birth of a son of God there be understood his birth foreseen from eternity and provided in time; because as to the human, which he took to himself in time, he is called openly the son of God.

There appeared a magnificent palace, and in its inmost a temple. In the midst of the latter was a table of gold, upon which was the Word, beside which two angels were standing. Around it were seats in three rows; the seats of the first row were covered with silken cloth of a purple color; the seats of the second row, with silken cloth, of a blue color; and the seats of the third row, with white cloth. Under the roof, high above the table, there appeared a widespread canopy, shining with precious stones, from whose splendor shone forth as it were a rainbow, as when heaven clears up after a shower. There then suddenly appeared a number of the clergy, occupying all the seats, clothed in the garments of their priestly office. At one side was a wardrobe, where an angel keeper stood; and within there lay splendid garments in beautiful order. [2] It was a council convoked by the Lord; and I heard a voice from heaven, saying, “Deliberate.” But they said, “Upon what?” It was said, “Concerning the Lord and concerning the Holy Spirit.” But when they thought upon these subjects, they were not in enlightenment; wherefore they supplicated, and then light descended from heaven, which first illumined the back part of their heads, and afterwards their temples, and at length their faces; and then they began; and, as it was commanded, first concerning the"

The first question proposed and discussed was, “Who assumed the human in the virgin Mary?” And an angel standing at the table upon which was the Word, read before them these words in Luke: The angel said to Mary, Behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and shalt bring forth a son, and shalt call his name Jesus; he shall be great, and shall be called the son of the most high. And Mary said to the angel, How shall this be, since I know not a man? And the angel answering said, The Holy Spirit shall come upon thee, and the power of the most high shall overshadow thee; whence the holy one that is born of thee shall be called the son of God (Luke 1:31–32, 34–35). As also what is in Matthew 1:20–25; and what is in verse 25 there he read emphatically. Besides these, he read many things from the Evangelists, where the Lord as to his human is called “the son of God,” and where he from his human calls Jehovah his “Father,” as also from the prophets, where it is foretold that Jehovah himself would come into the world; among which also these two, in Isaiah: It shall be said in that day, Lo, This is our God, whom we have waited for, that he may free us; This is Jehovah, whom we have waited for; let us exult and rejoice in his salvation (Isa. 25:9). The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way for Jehovah, make straight in the desert a highway for our God; for the glory of Jehovah shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together; Behold, the lord Jehovah cometh in strength; he shall feed his flock as a shepherd (Isa. 40:3, 5, 10–11). [3] And the angel said, “Since Jehovah himself came into the world, and assumed the human, and thereby saved and redeemed men, he is therefore called ‘the savior’ and ‘the redeemer’ in the prophets.” And then he read before them these passages following: Surely God is in thee, and there is no God besides; verily thou art a hidden God, O God of Israel, the savior (Isa. 45:14–15). Am not I Jehovah? And there is no God else besides me; a just God and a savior, there is none besides me (Isa. 45:21–22)."

That all flesh may know that I Jehovah am thy savior and thy redeemer (Isa. 49:26; 60:16). As for our redeemer, Jehovah of hosts is his name (Isa. 47:4). Their redeemer is strong, Jehovah of hosts is his name (Jer. 50:34). O Jehovah, my rock and my redeemer (Ps. 19:14). Thus said Jehovah thy redeemer, the holy one of Israel, I Jehovah am thy God (Isa. 43:14; 48:17; 49:7; 54:8). Thou O Jehovah art our Father, our redeemer, thy name is from an age (Isa. 63:16). Thus said Jehovah thy redeemer, I am Jehovah that maketh all things, and alone by myself (Isa. 14:24). Thus said Jeh ovah king of Israel, and his redeemer Jehovah of hosts, I am the first and the last, and besides me there is no God (Isa. 44:6).

[4] Being confirmed from all these passages, those that sat upon the seats said unanimously that Jehovah himself assumed the human to save and redeem men. But there was then heard a voice from the Roman Catholics, who had hid themselves in a corner of the temple, saying, “How can Jehovah the Father become man? Ishe not the creator of the universe?” And one of them that sat upon the seats of the second row turned himself, and said, “Who then?”"

And what is a son or a God born from eternity? And how can the Divine essence, which is one and indivisible, be separated, and some of it descend and take on the human, and not the whole?” [5] The second discussion concerning the Lord was, whether God the Father and he thus are one, as the soul and the body are one? They said that this is a consequence, because the soul is from the Father. And then one of those who sat upon the seats in the third row read from the creed which is called Athanasian these words: “Although our Lord Jesus Christ, the son of God, is God and man, still they are not two, but one Christ; yea, he is altogether one, he is one person; since as the soul and the body make one man, so God and man are one Christ.” The reader said that this faith is received in the whole Christian world, even by the Roman Catholics. And they then said, “What need is there of more? God the Father and he are one, as the soul and the body are one.” And they said, “As it is so, we see that the Lord’s human is Divine, because it is the human of Jehovah; then that the Lord as to the Divine human is to be approached; and that thus and not otherwise can the Divine which is called the Father be approached.” [6] This conclusion of theirs the angel confirmed by many more passages from the Word, among which were these in Isaiah: Unto us a boy is born, unto us a son is given, whose name is wonderful, counselor, God, hero, the father of eternity, the prince of peace (Isa. 9:6). Thou art our Father, Abraham hath not known us, and Israel doth not acknowledge us; thou, O Jehovah; art our Father, our redeemer from everlasting is thy name (Isa. 63:16).

Jesus said, I am the way, the truth, and the life; no one cometh to the Father but by me (John 14:6). On hearing these, they all said with one voice and heart, that the Lord’s human is Divine, and that this is to be approached that the Father may be approached; since Jehovah God, who is the Lord from eternity, through it sent himself into the world, and made himself visible to the eyes of men, and thus accessible. Likewise he made himself visible and thus accessible in the human form to the ancients, but then through an angel. [7] After this followed the deliberation concerning the Holy Spirit. And first was disclosed the idea of many respecting God the Father, the son, and the Holy Spirit, which was as if God the Father was sitting on high, and the son at his right hand, and they were sending forth the Holy Spirit from them, to enlighten and teach men. But a voice was then heard from heaven, saying, “We cannot endure that idea of thought. Who does not know that Jehovah God is omnipresent? He who knows and acknowledges this, will also acknowledge that he himself enlightens and teaches; and that there is not an intermediate God, distinct from him, and still less from two, as one person from another. Therefore let the former idea, which is vain, be removed; and let this, which is just, be received, and you will see this clearly.” [8] But a voice was then heard again from the Roman Catholics, who had hid themselves in the corner of the temple, saying, “What then is the Holy Spirit, who is named in the Word in the evangelists and in Paul, by whom so many of the learned men from the clergy, especially from ours, say that they are led? Who in the Christian world at this day denies the Holy Spirit and its operation?” At this one of those who were sitting upon the second row of seats, turned himself and said, “The Holy Spirit is the Divine proceeding from Jehovah the Lord.

One God cannot go forth and proceed from another through a third, but the Divine can. Is not the Divine essence one and indivisible? And as the Divine essence or the Divine esse is God, is not God one and indivisible?” [9] On hearing these things, they who sat upon the seats concluded unanimously that the Holy Spirit is not a person by itself, nor a God by itself; but that it is the Holy Divine going forth and proceeding from the only omnipresent God, who is the Lord. At this the angels that stood by the golden table upon which was the Word, said, “It is well. We do not anywhere read in the Old Testament, that the prophets spoke the Word from the Holy Spirit, but from Jehovah the Lord; and where ‘the Holy Spirit’ is mentioned in the New Testament, the proceeding Divine is meant, which is the Divine enlightening, teaching, vivifying, reforming, and regenerating.” [10] After this there followed another discussion concerning the Holy Spirit, which was, From whom does the Divine which is called the Holy Spirit proceed? Is it from the Divine which is called the Father, or from the Divine human which is called the son? And when they were discussing this, the light shone on them from heaven, from which they saw that the holy Divine, which is meant by the Holy Spirit, proceeds from the Divine in the Lord through his glorified human, which is the Divine human, comparatively as all activity proceeds from the soul through the body with man. This the angel standing at the table confirmed from the Word by these passages: He whom the Father hath sent, speaketh the words of God; he hath not given the spirit by measure unto him; the Father loveth the son, and hath given all things into his hand (John 3:34–35)."

And just before his departure out of the world, he said: Lo, I am with you all the days until the consummation of the age (Matt. 28:20). Having read these words before them, the angel said, “From these and many other passages in the Word, it is manifest that the Divine which is called the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Divine in the Lord through his Divine human.” To this they that sat upon the seats said, “This is the Divine truth.”"

This reasoning being heard by two Gentiles who stood at the door, one of them said to the other, “These people have no religion at all, for who does not know, that what is called religion consists in doing good to the neighbor for the sake of God, consequently, from God and with God?” n. 484. 17 I was seized with a grievous disease, proceeding from the smoke emitted from that Jerusalem mentioned in Revelation 11:8, which is called Sodom and Egypt, and I was seen by those who were in that city as dead, who said among themselves, that I was not worthy of burial, the like of which is related concerning the two witnesses mentioned in the same chapter; and moreover, I heard many blasphemies from the dwellers in that city, because I had preached repentance and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; but inasmuch as a judgment was executed upon them, I saw that the whole of that city fell, and was overflowed with waters, and afterwards that they ran about among heaps of stones, and lamented their lot, when nevertheless they believed that through the faith of their church they were renewed and made just; but it was said to them that they were the farthest off from being such, because they never performed any act of repentance, and thence they knew not one evil that was damnable in themselves; after that it was said to them from heaven, that faith in the Lord and repentance are the two means of regeneration and salvation, and that this is most obvious from the Word, and, above all, from the Decalogue, baptism, and the holy supper, as may be seen in the relation, n. 531. 18 There was a debate among spirits, whether a man can see any genuine truth in the Word, without immediately approaching the Lord, who is the Word itself; but because there were some who contradicted it, an experiment was made, and then they who approached God the Father could not see any truths, but all who approached the Lord were enabled to see them. During this dispute there came up out of the bottomless pit certain spirits, mentioned in Revelation 9, when they proceeded to examine the mysteries of justification by faith alone, saying that they"

After that the angelic spirits were led to another table like the former, on which lay the Word encompassed by a rainbow, which, when a certain leader of the doctrine of faith alone touched with his hand, an explosion took place as from a gun, and he was cast into a corner of the room, and lay there for the space of an hour to all appearance dead.

But with regard to them in whom there is neither light nor heat, that is, the good and truth of heaven, their lot is rigorous, for when they enter they are miserably tormented, and from the torment, cast themselves down headlong; this arises to them from the sphere of the light and heat of heaven, in whom these properties are opposed; after which, they no longer desire heaven, but associate themselves with their like in hell: hence it appears, that it is vain to suppose, that heaven consists in admission through favor, and that being admitted they enter into the enjoyments therein, like those who in this world enter into a house where there is a marriage.

Among those who stood below and saw them thus fall, were some boys with their master, and he instructed them what this appearance as it were of dead horses signified and that then what they saw were certain persons who, at a distance, so appeared, observing that they were those who, when they read the Word, think of God, the neighbor, and of heaven materially and not spiritually, and that they think materially of God, who think from person concerning essence, and of the neighbor and his quality from his face and speech, and of heaven and the state of love therein from place; but that they think spiritually, who think of God from his essence and thence of his person, of the neighbor from his quality, and thence of his face and speech, and of heaven from a state of love therein and thence of place.

After this sight, I went into a garden, through which I was conducted by a certain angelic spirit, and at length to a palace which was called the temple of wisdom, of a quadrangular shape, its walls of crystal, its roof of jasper, and the foundations consisted of precious stones of various kinds; and he said that no one could enter that temple, except he who was in the belief, that the things which he knows, understands, and is wise in, are so little in comparison with those which he does not know, understand, and which he is not wise in, as to be scarcely anything; and because I was in this belief, it was given me to enter, and I saw that this whole temple seemed built to be the form of light. I related in this temple what I had heard from the two angels concerning love and wisdom, and they asked whether they had not mentioned a third, which is use; and they said that love and wisdom without use are only ideal things, but that in use they became realities; and that it is the same with charity, faith, and good works. After this I left the temple and walked in the garden, and I saw some spirits sitting under a laurel and eating figs: whom I asked in what manner they understood, that man can do good from God, and yet do it as from himself; who replied, that God operates it inwardly in man, but if man does good from his own will and from his own understanding, that he defiles it, so that it is no longer good; but in reply to this, I said, that man is only an organ of life; and that if he believes in the Lord he does good of himself from the Lord, but if he does not believe in the Lord, and still more if he does not believe in any God, he does good of himself from hell, and moreover, that"

After these things, in returning home with the angelic spirit, he illustrated what faith and charity are, and what their conjunction effects; this he illustrated by a comparison with light and heat, which meet in a third, because light in heaven in its essence is the truth of faith, and heat there in its essence is the good of charity; hence that as light without heat, which like the light of winter in the world strips the trees of leaves and fruit, so is faith without charity; and as light united to heat which like the light of spring vivifies all things, so is faith united to charity, n. 875. 27 I was carried to a place where they were who are meant by the false prophet, and by one of them there I was invited to see their place of worship, and I went and saw it, and therein was the image of a woman clothed in a scarlet robe, holding in her right hand a golden medal, and in her left a string of pearls, but these things were induced by fantasies; but when the interiors of my mind were opened by the Lord, instead of the place of worship, I saw a house full of crevices, and instead of the woman I saw a beast, like that described in Revelation 13:2; and under ground there was a bog, in which the Word lay deeply hidden: but presently, from the blowing of an east wind, the place of worship was removed, the bog dried up, and the Word exposed to view; and then by light from heaven there appeared the tabernacle such as it was with Abraham, when the three angels came to him and foretold the birth of Isaac: and afterwards, from light which was sent forth from the second heaven, instead of the tabernacle there appeared the temple, such as it was at Jerusalem: after these things, the light shone from the third heaven, and then the temple disappeared, and the Lord alone was seen, standing upon the foundation stone, where was the Word, but because an excessive holiness then filled their minds, this latter light was withdrawn, and instead thereof, light from the second heaven was sent forth; from which the former appearance of the temple returned, and within it the tabernacle, n. 926."
