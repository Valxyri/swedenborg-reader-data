      "text": "APOCALYPSE REVEALED 1 Editor’s Preface Apocalypse Revealed is a detailed unfolding of the inner or spiritual sense of the book of Revelation. This is the first of Swedenborg’s later works to which he appended so-called “memorable relations,” which are descriptions of otherworld events he witnessed. In 1765 he had stopped writing in his Spiritual Diary—a work which contains much similar material—and now in this 1766 work (and all of his subsequent publications) he included accounts of such happenings. In a letter written to his friend Dr. Gabriel Beyer in April 1766 he recommended that the doctor read these passages first. This is the last work that Swedenborg published anonymously. Unlike his incomplete treatise, Apocalypse Explained, written earlier than Apocalypse Revealed but published posthumously, this work is openly addressed to the Christian world, and thus marks an apparently new attitude on Swedenborg’s part as to where the new church was to have its origin. This present edition was translated from the Latin by John Whitehead. The text was electronically scanned from the Swedenborg Foundation’s Standard Edition. This has allowed the book to be completely redesigned and set in a new and more readable typeface. Certain stylistic changes have also been introduced. These include modernized spelling and punctuation as well as the substitution of new words for terms whose meanings have become obscure or have changed since the nineteenth century. Arabic numerals have replaced roman numerals in Bible passages, and certain capitalized words, including pro nouns referring to God, have been lowercased to reflect contemporary usage. All these changes have been carefully made in order to make the book easier to read and use while preserving the dignity and power of the original Latin. On the whole, however, the Whitehead translation has not been materially altered. A word needs to be said about the translation of the Scripture passages in this work, some of which Swedenborg translated from"

The reader will note that the archaic language of the 1611 King James Bible, commonly called the Authorized Version, has for the most part been retained in the Scripture citations in this edition. Thus verbs will often have the suffix “-eth,” and pronoun forms such as “thee,” “thou,” and “thine” are retained. This custom, based on the almost universal use of the King James version at that time, dates back to the earliest English translations of Swedenborg. The decision was made by the early translators to follow the familiar language of that Bible wherever it did not conflict with the Latin of Swedenborg’s Scripture citations. Although it would be desirable to update this language, these citations appear so frequently that changing them throughout the entire work would have required a major revision. Volume 1 of Apocalypse Revealed begins Swedenborg’s verse-by- verse explanation, or commentary, of the biblical text of the Apocalypse, commonly known as the book of Revelation or the Revelation of John. This volume covers chapters 1 through 13. As was the custom in his day, Swedenborg referred to the Psalms as the book of David, and to the Pentateuch (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy) as the books of Moses. Numbers indicating the paragraph subdivisions used in John Faulkner Potts’ six-volume Swedenborg Concordance (London: Swedenborg Society, 1888–1902) are inserted in this American edition for the first time. They appear in bracketed boldface type at the beginning of paragraphs. The numbers in parentheses (6), (7), etc., are divisions of the exposition by the author. Italicized letters following a number (518a, 518b) are subdivisions added by the Latin editor, Samuel H. Worcester. Words or phrases in brackets are also editorial insertions into Swedenborg’s text.

      "text": "APOCALYPSE REVEALED 3 Author’s Preface [1] There are many who have labored in the explanation of the Apocalypse [Book of Revelation], but, as the spiritual sense of the Word had been hitherto unknown, they could not see the arcana which lie concealed therein, for the spiritual sense alone discloses these; on which account expositors have conjectured various things, and the most of them have applied the things that are therein to the states of empires, intermingling also some things about ecclesiastical affairs. But the book of Revelation, like the whole Word, does not in the least in its spiritual sense treat of worldly things, but of heavenly things, thus not of empires and kingdoms, but of heaven and the church. [2] It is to be known that after the last judgment, which was accomplished in the spiritual world in the year 1757 (concerning which see material published in a small work in London in 1758), there was formed a new heaven from Christians; but only from those who could receive the Lord as the God of heaven and earth, according to his words in Matthew 28:18, and who at the same time in the world had repented of their evil works. From this heaven a new church on earth, which is the new Jerusalem, is descending and will descend. That this church will acknowledge the Lord alone is manifest from these passages in the book of Revelation: There came unto me one of the seven angels and spoke with me, saying, Come, I will show you the bride, the lamb’s wife; and he showed me the great city, holy Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God (Rev. 21:9–10). And in another place: Let us rejoice and exult; for the time of the marriage of the lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready. Happy are they that are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb (Rev. 19:7, 9)."

      "text": "APOCALYPSE REVEALED 4 That there is to be a new heaven and that the new church on earth will descend therefrom is manifest from these words there: I saw a new heaven and a new earth; and I saw the holy city Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. He that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new; and he said unto me, Write, for these words are true and faithful (Rev. 21:1–2, 5). The “new heaven” is the new church from Christians; the “new Jerusalem” is the new church on earth, which will act as one with that new heaven. The “lamb” is the Lord as to the divine human. [3] To this something will be added for illustration. The Christian heaven is below the ancient heavens. Into it, from the time of the Lord, when he was in the world, were admitted those who worshiped one God under three persons, and who at the same time did not have an idea of three gods; and this was because the trinity of persons had been received in the whole Christian world. But they who cherished no other idea of the Lord’s human than as the human of another man could not receive the faith of the new Jerusalem; which is that the Lord is the only God in whom is the trinity. These were for that reason separated and sent away to the extremes; it was given me to see the separations and the removals after the last judgment. For the whole heaven is founded upon a just idea of God, and the whole church on earth, and in general all religion; since by that idea there is conjunction, and by conjunction light, wisdom, and eternal happiness. [4] Everyone can see that the book of Revelation can by no means be explained except by the Lord alone; for each word therein contains arcana, which could never be known without a particular enlightenment, and thus revelation; wherefore it has pleased the Lord to open the sight of my spirit and to teach me. Do not believe, therefore, that I have taken anything therein from myself, nor from any angel, but from the Lord alone. The Lord also said to John through an angel: Seal not the words of the prophecy of this book (Rev. 22:10). By which is meant that they are to be made manifest."

Of baptism, they teach: that Adam, after the offense of transgression, was wholly changed for the worse, both as to body and soul; that this sin was transfused into the whole human race; that this original sin is taken away only by the merit of Christ; and that the merit of Christ is applied by the sacrament of baptism; and that thus the whole guilt of original sin is taken away by baptism; that nevertheless lust remains in the baptized as an incentive to sins, but not sin itself; that thus they put on Christ, become new creatures, and obtain a full and complete remission of sins. Baptism is called the laver of regeneration and of faith. That the baptized, when grown up, are to be questioned concerning the promises made by their sponsors; which is the sacrament of confirmation. That by reason of lapses after baptism, the sacrament of repentance is necessary. “2. The eucharist or holy supper. That immediately after consecration, the true body and the true blood of Jesus Christ are really and substantially contained under the form of bread and wine, together with his soul and divinity; the body under the form of bread, and the blood under the form of wine, by virtue of the words: but the body itself under the form of wine, and the blood under the form of bread, and the soul under both, by virtue of a natural connection and concomitance, whereby the parts of the Lord Christ are united together, and the divinity by reason of its"

That water is to be mixed with wine in the cup. That the laity are to receive the communion from the clergy, and the clergy from themselves. That the true body and the true blood of Christ, after consecration, are in the host in the consecrated particles; and that therefore the host is to be adored when it is shown and carried about. That this wonderful and particular conversion of the whole substance of the bread into body, and of the whole substance of the wine into blood, is called transubstantiation. That the communion of both forms, under certain conditions, may be granted by the pontiff. It is called supersubstantial bread, and the bread of angels, which these eat without any veils; it is also called spiritual food; also the antidote by which they are freed from sins. “3. Masses. It is called the sacrifice of the mass, because the sacrifice by which Christ offered up himself to God the Father, is represented thereby under the form of the bread and wine; that thence it is a sacrifice truly propitiatory, pure, and there is nothing in it except what is holy. That if the people do not commune sacramentally, but only the minister, then the people commune spiritually, because the ministers do it, not for themselves only, but for all the faithful who appertain to the body of Christ. The masses ought not to be performed in the vulgar tongue, because they contain the great learning of the faithful people; but that the ministers may declare some thing concerning it on the Lord’s days. That it is ordained, that some things which are mystical should be pronounced with a lower, and other things with a louder, voice; and, for the purpose of giving majesty to so great a sacrifice which is offered to God, there should be lights, incense, garments, and other like things. That it is to be offered for the sins, penalties, satisfactions, and all the necessities of the living, and also for the dead. That masses in honor of the saints are thanksgivings because they intercede when they are implored."

      "text": "APOCALYPSE REVEALED 7 “4. Repentance. That besides baptism there is the sacrament of repentance, whereby the benefit of the death and merit of Christ is applied to those who lapse after baptism; therefore it is called a kind of laborious baptism. That the parts of repentance are contrition, confession, and satisfaction. That contrition is the gift of God, and the impulse of the Holy Spirit, not yet indwelling, but only moving, therefore it is a disposing. That confession ought to be made of all mortal sins, even the most secret, and of the intentions; that sins which are withheld from confession are not forgiven, but that those which after search do not occur, are included in confession; that confession ought to be made at least once a year: that absolution of sins is to be given by the ministers of the keys, and that they are forgiven on their saying, I absolve; that absolution is like the act of a judge when sentence is pronounced; that the more grievous sins are to be absolved by bishops, and the still more grievous by the pontiff. Satisfaction is made by satisfactory punishments imposed by the ministry at discretion, according to the measure of the offense; that when eternal punishment is remitted, then temporal punishment is remitted also. That the power of indulgences was left by Christ to the church, and that the use of them is most salutary. “5. Justification. That the change from that state in which man is born a son of Adam, cannot be effected into a state of grace through the second Adam the Savior, without the washing of regeneration and faith, or without baptism. That the second beginning of justification is from preventing grace, which is a calling, with which man cooperates by converting himself. That disposition is produced by faith, when man believes those things to be true which are revealed, to which he is freely moved; also by hope, when he believes that God is propitious for the sake of Christ; and by charity, in consequence whereof he begins to love his neighbor, and to hate sin. That justification, which follows, is not only remission of sins, but sanctification, and renovation of the interior man; that then they are not reputed just, but that they are just, receiving justice in themselves; and because they receive the merit of Christ’s passion, justification is inserted by faith, hope, and charity."

That the just may fall into light and venial sins, and still be just; and that therefore the just ought continually to labor by prayers, oblations, alms, and fastings, lest they should fall, because they are born again into the hope of glory, and not into glory. That the just, if they fall from the grace of justification, may be justified again by the sacrament of repentance: that by any mortal sin grace is lost, but not faith, but that faith also is lost by infidelity, which is a receding from religion. That the works of a justified man are merits; and that the justified merit eternal life by those that are done by them through the grace of God and the merit of Christ. That free-will was not lost and extinguished after the sin of Adam; and that man cooperates by assenting to the calling of God; and that otherwise he would be an inanimate body. They establish predestination, by saying that no one knows whether he is in the number of the predestined, and among those whom God has elected to himself, except by special revelation. “6. Purgatory. That all the guilt from which men are to be purified by temporal punishment is not blotted out by justification, and therefore all come into purgatory to be purified, before the entrance into heaven is open. That the souls there detained are assisted by the suffrages of the faithful, and particularly by the sacrifice of the mass; and that this is diligently to be taught and preached. The torments there endured are variously described, but they are inventions, and in themselves fictions. “7. The seven sacraments. That there are seven sacraments, baptism, confirmation, the eucharist, repentance, extreme unction, order, and matrimony; that there are neither more nor less: that one is of greater dignity than another; that they contain grace; and that from the work operated by them grace is conferred; that there were the same number of sacraments of the ancient law.

The sacrament of extreme unction: that it is founded on the epistle of James, chap. 5:14–15; that it is to be administered to the sick near the end of life, whence it is called the sacrament of the departing; that if they recover, it may be applied again; that it is performed with oil blessed by the bishop, and with these words: `May God grant thee indulgence for whatsoever offense thou hast committed through the fault of the eyes, the nostrils, or the touch.’ The sacrament of order: that there are seven orders in the ministry of the priesthood, which differ in dignity, and all together are called the ecclesiastical hierarchy, which is like the order of an encampment; that inaugurations into the ministry are to be effected by anointings, and by transferring of the Holy Spirit into them. That the secular power or consent, calling or authority of the magistrate is not required for the ordination of bishops and priests; that they who ascend to the ministry being appointed by a calling from them only, are not ministers, but thieves and robbers, who do not enter in by the door. The sacrament of matrimony: that the dispensation of degrees and divorces belongs to the church. That the clergy are not to contract matrimony. That all of them may have the gift of chastity, and if anyone saith he cannot, when nevertheless he has vowed, let him be anathema, because God does not refuse it to those who seek it in a right way, and does not suffer anyone to be tempted beyond what he is able to bear.

That the saints reigning together with Christ offer up their prayers to God for men; that Christ is to be adored, and the saints to be invoked; that the invocation of saints is not idolatrous, nor derogatory to the honor of the one mediator between God and men; it is called latria. That images of Christ, of Mary the God-bearer and of the saints, are to be revered and honored; not that it is to be believed that there is divinity or virtue in them, but because the honor which is paid to them is referred to the prototypes which they represent; and that through the images which they kiss, and before which they kneel and uncover their"

That the pope of Rome is the successor of the apostle Peter, and vicar of Jesus Christ, the head of the church, and the universal bishop; that he is above councils; that he has the keys to open and shut heaven, consequently the power of remitting and retaining sins; that therefore he, as key-bearer of everlasting life, hath a right at once to earthly and heavenly empire; that moreover bishops and priests have such a power from him, because it was given also to the rest of the apostles, and that therefore they are called ministers of the keys. That it belongs to the church to judge of the true sense and interpretation of the sacred Scripture, and that they who oppose them are to be punished by penalties established by law.

That they believe in God the Father as the creator and preserver; in God the Son as the savior and redeemer; and in the Holy Spirit as the enlightener and sanctifier, is also known. “2. Of Christ the Lord. Concerning the person of Christ, the same doctrine is not taught by all the Reformed. The Lutherans teach that the virgin Mary not only conceived and brought forth a real man, but also the real son of God, whence she is rightly called, and truly is, the mother of God. That in Christ there are two natures, the Divine and the human, the Divine from eternity, and the human in time; that these two natures are personally united, altogether in such a manner, that there are not two Christs, one the son of God, and the other the son of man; but that one and the same is the son of God and the son of man, not that these two natures are mixed together into one substance, nor that one is changed into the other, but that both natures retain their essential properties, which are also described as to their qualities; that their union is hypostatic, and that this is the most perfect communion, like that of the soul and body; that therefore it is rightly said, that in Christ God is man and man God. [2] “That he did not suffer for us as mere man only, but as such man, whose human nature has so strict and ineffable a union and communion with the son of God, as to become one person with him; that the son of God truly suffered for us, but yet according to the properties of the human nature; that the son of man, by whom is meant Christ as to the human nature, was really exalted to the right hand of God when he was taken into God, which was the case as soon as he was conceived of the Holy Spirit in the womb of the mother; that Christ always had that majesty by reason of the personal union, but that, in the state of exinanition, he only exercised it so far as seemed good to him; but that after the resurrection he fully and entirely put off the form of a servant, and established the human nature or essence in the plenary possession of the Divine majesty; and that in this manner he entered into glory; in a word, Christ is, and remains to all eternity, perfect God"

That there is no difference of adoration, because through the nature which is seen, the divinity which is not seen, is adored. That the Divine essence communicates and imparts its own excellences to the human nature, and performs its Divine operations through the body as through its organ; that thus all the fullness of the divinity dwells in Christ bodily, according to Paul. [3] “That the incarnation was accomplished that he might reconcile the Father to us, and become a sacrifice for the sins of the whole world, as well original as actual; that he was incarnated from the substance of the Holy Spirit, but that his human nature was produced from the virgin Mary, which, as the Word, he assumed and united to himself; that he sanctifies those who believe in him, by sending the Holy Spirit into their hearts, to rule, comfort, and vivify them, and defend them against the devil and the power of sin. That Christ descended to those below, and destroyed hell for all believers; but in what manner these things were effected, he does not wish them to scrutinize too curiously, but that the knowledge of this matter may be reserved for another age, when not only this mystery, but many other things also will be revealed.” These particulars are from Luther; the Augustan Confession; the Nicene Council, and the Smalcaldic Articles. See the Formula Concordiae. [4] “By another part of the Reformed, who are also treated of in the Formula Concordiae, it is believed that Christ, according to his human nature, by exaltation, received only created gifts and finite power, therefore that he is a man like any other, retaining the properties of the flesh; that therefore as to his human nature he is not omnipresent and omniscient; that although absent he governs, as King, things remote from himself; that as God from eternity he is with the Father, and as Man born in time, he is with the angels in heaven; and that when it is said, in Christ God is Man and Man God, it is only a figure of speech; besides other things of a like nature."

Of justification by faith, and of good works. The justifying and saving faith of the clergy is this: that God the Father turned himself away from the human race on account of their iniquities, and so, from justice, condemned them to eternal death, and that he therefore sent the son into the world to expiate and redeem them, and to satisfy and reconcile; and that the son did this by taking upon himself the condemnation of the law, and suffering himself to be crucified, and that thus by obedience he entirely satisfied God’s justice, even to becoming justice himself; and that God the Father imputes and applies this, as his merit, to believers, and sends the Holy Spirit to them, who operates charity, good works, and repentance, as a good tree produces good fruits; and justifies, renews, regenerates, and sanctifies; and that this faith is the only means of salvation, and that by it alone a man’s sins are forgiven. [2] “They distinguish between the act and the state of justification; by the act of justification they understand the beginning of justification, which takes place in a moment, when man by that faith alone takes hold of the merit of Christ with confidence; by the state of justification they understand the progress of that faith, which takes place by the interior operation of the Holy Spirit, which does not manifest itself except by certain signs, concerning which they teach various things. They speak also of manifest good works, which are done from the man and his will, and follow that faith; but they exclude them from justification,"

That charity, good works, and repentance, do not enter into the act of justification, but that in the state of justification they are necessary, especially by reason of God’s command, and that by them they merit the corporeal rewards of this life, but not the remission of sins, and the glory of eternal life, because faith alone, without the works of the law, justifies and saves. [5] “That faith in act justifies man, but faith in state renovates him; that in renovation by reason of God’s command, the works reputed good, as commanded by the Decalogue, are necessary to be performed, because it is the will of God that carnal lusts should be restrained by civil discipline, for which reason he has provided doctrine, laws, magistrates, and punishments; that, therefore, it is consequently false, that by works we merit remission of sins and salvation, and that works have any effect in preserving faith, and that it is also false, that man is reputed just on account of the justice of his reason; and that reason can, from its own powers, love God above all things and do his law; in a word, that faith and salvation are not preserved and retained in men by good works, but only by the Spirit of God and by faith; but still that good works are testimonies that the Holy Spirit is present and dwells in them. They condemn as pernicious, the expression that good works are hurtful to salvation; because the interior works of the Holy Spirit are to be understood, which are good, not the exterior ones proceed ing from man’s own will, which are not good but evil, because meritorious. [6] “They teach, moreover, that Christ at the last judgment will pronounce sentence upon good and evil works as effects proper and not proper to the faith of man. This faith reigns at this day in the whole Reformed Christian world with the clergy, but not with the laity, except a very few; for the laity by faith understand nothing else but to believe in God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, and that he who lives well and believes well, will be saved; and of the Lord that he is the savior; for they are ignorant of the mysteries of justification of their preachers, who, although they preach such"

[7] “But yet the teachers teach this same faith differently in the different kingdoms in which the Reformed Church is established; in Germany, Sweden, and Denmark, they say that the Holy Spirit operates by that faith, and justifies and sanctifies men, and afterwards successively renovates and regenerates them, but without the works of the law; and they who are in that faith from trust and confidence, are in grace with God the Father; and that then the evils which they do, appear indeed, but are constantly remitted. [8] “In England, they teach that this faith produces charity without man’s knowing it, and that when man feels the Holy Spirit operate interiorly in himself, this operation also is the good of charity; and if he does not feel it, and yet does good for the sake of salvation, that it may be called good, but still that it derives somewhat from man, in that there is merit in it. Moreover, that such faith can operate this at the last hour of death, yet it is not known how. [9] “In Holland, they teach, that God the Father, for the sake of the son, justifies and purifies man interiorly by the Holy Spirit through that faith, but even to his own will, from which he turns back without touching it; some teach that he touches it lightly, and that thus the evils of man’s will do not appear before God. But few of the laity know anything of these mysteries of the clergy; nor are they willing to publish them as they are in themselves, because they know that the laity do not relish them. “4. Of the law and the gospel. That the law was given by God, that it may be known what sin is, and that thus it may be restrained by threats and by fear, and afterwards by the promise and the announcement of grace; therefore the special office of the law is, to reveal original sin and all its fruits, and to make known to what a"

This effect of the law is called contrition, which is not active or factitious, but passive, and the torment of conscience. But the gospel is the whole doctrine concerning Christ and faith; and thus concerning the remission of sins; consequently, a most gladdening messenger, not reproving and terrifying, but comforting. By the law the wrath of God against all impiety is revealed, and man is condemned, therefore it causes man to look to Christ, and to the gospel; they must both be preached, because they are connected. The gospel teaches that Christ took upon himself the curse of the law and expiated all sins, and that we consequently obtain remission by faith. That the Holy Spirit is given and received, and the heart of man renewed, not by the preaching of the law, but of the gospel; and that the Spirit afterwards makes use of the ministry of the law, to teach and show in the Decalogue, what the good will and pleasure of God is; thus the Spirit makes dead and makes alive. That a distinction is to be made between the works of the law, and the works of the Spirit, therefore the faithful are not under the law, but under grace, for that very reason. That the justice of the law does not justify, that is, does not reconcile nor regenerate, nor, by itself, make men accepted of God; but when the Holy Spirit is given, the fulfilling of the law follows. That the works of the second table of the Decalogue do not justify, because by it we act with men, and not properly with God, and yet in justification we must act with God. That Christ, because without sin, suffered the punishment of sin, and was made an offering for us, whereby he took away that right of the law, that it might not condemn believers, because he is a propitiation for them, for the sake of which they are reputed just. “5. Of repentance and confession. That repentance consists of two parts; one is contrition, or terror struck into the conscience by reason of sin; the other faith, which is conceived from the gospel, and by the remission of sins, comforts the conscience and delivers from terrors. He who confesses that he is wholly sin, comprehends all sins, excludes none, and forgets none; thus sins are purged away,"

That the enumeration of sins ought to be free, as the person may choose or not choose; and that great stress is to be laid upon private confession and absolution; therefore if anyone chooses, he may confess his sins, and receive absolution from the confessor, and the sins are then remitted. The words which the minister is to make use of on this occasion are, `May God be propitious to thee, and confirm thy faith; be it unto thee as thou believest, and I, by the commandment of the Lord, remit to thee thy sins;’ but others say, `I announce to thee the remission of thy sins:’ that still, however, sins are not forgiven by repentance any more than by works; but by faith. Therefore, the repentance of the clergy is only a confession before God that they are sinners, and a prayer that they may persevere in faith. That expiations and satisfactions are not necessary, because Christ is the expiation and satisfaction. “6. Of original sin, they teach: That after the fall of Adam all men propagated according to nature are born with sin, that is, without the fear of God, and with lusts; and that this condemns and brings eternal death upon those who are not born again by Baptism and the Holy Spirit; that it is a privation of original justice, and at the same time an inordinate disposition of the parts of the soul, and a corrupt habit. That there is a difference between the nature itself into which man was created, which exists even after the fall, and remains a creature of God, and original sin; therefore, that there is a difference between corrupt nature, and the corruption which is inherent in nature, and by which nature is corrupted; that no one but God alone can separate the corruption of nature from nature itself; that this will manifestly be done in the blessed resurrection, because then nature itself, which man bears around in the world, will rise again without original sin, and enjoy eternal felicity; that the difference is as between the work of God and the work of the devil; that this sin did not invade nature in such a manner, as if Satan had created any evil substantially and commixed it with nature, but that concreated and original justice was lost: that original sin is an accident; and that by reason of it,"

Of baptism. That baptism is not simply water, but that it is water taken by the Divine command, and sealed with the Word of God, and thus sanctified: that the virtue, work, fruit, and end of baptism is, that men may be saved and admitted into the Christian communion. That by baptism victory is offered over death and the devil; remission of sins; the grace of God; Christ with all his works; and the Holy Spirit with all his gifts; and eternal blessedness to all and every believer. Whether faith be given to infants, also, by baptism, is a question too deep to be solicitously inquired into. That immersion in water signifies the mortification of the old man, and the resurrection of the new; that therefore it may be called the laver of regeneration; and the true laver in the Word; also in the death and burial of Christ. That the life of a Christian is a daily baptism once begun in this manner; that the water does not effect this, but the Word of God, which is in and with the water, and the faith of God’s Word added to the water; that hence it follows, that baptism in the name of God, is performed by men indeed, but is not from them, but from God himself. That baptism does not take away original sin by extinguishing depraved lust, but only the guilt of it. “But others of the Reformed believe, that baptism is an external laver of water, whereby an internal ablution from sins is signified; that it does not confer regeneration, faith, the grace of God, and salvation, but only signifies and seals them; and that they are not conferred in and with baptism, but afterwards as the person grows up; and that the elect alone obtain the grace of Christ and the gift of faith: and because salvation does not depend upon baptism, that therefore it is permitted to be performed by another in the lack of a regular minister."

They of the Reformed church, who are called Lutherans, teach that in the holy supper or sacrament of the altar, the body and blood of Christ are really and substantially present, and are actually distributed and received with the bread and wine; that therefore the real body and the real blood of Christ are in, with, and under the bread and wine and are given to Christians to eat and drink; and that therefore they are not simply bread and wine, but are included and bound to the Word of God, and that this causes them to be the body and blood of Christ; for when the Word accedes to the element, it becomes a sacrament; but yet that there is no transubstantiation, such as is that of the papists; that it is the food of the soul, nourishing and strengthening the new man: that it was instituted, to the end that faith might repair and receive its strength, to give remission of sins, and a new life, which Christ merited for us: that thus the body and blood of Christ are not only taken spiritually by faith, but also by the mouth, in a supernatural way, by reason of their sacramental union with the bread and wine: that the worthiness of this supper consists in obedience alone, and in the merit of Christ, which is applied by true faith. In a word, that the sacraments of the Lord’s supper and of baptism are testimonies of the will and grace of God towards men; and that the sacrament of the supper is a promise of remission of sins through faith; that it may move the heart to believe; and that the Holy Spirit may operate through the Word and the sacraments: that the consecration of the minister does not produce these effects, but that they are attributed to the sole omnipotent virtue of the Lord. That the unworthy, as well as the worthy, receive the real body and blood of Christ, as he hung upon the cross; but the worthy to salvation, the unworthy to condemnation; that they are worthy who have faith; that no one is to be forced to that supper, but everyone may approach when urged by spiritual hunger. [2] “Others, however, of the Reformed Church teach, that in the holy supper the body and blood of Christ are taken only spiritually, and that the bread and wine are only signs, types, symbols, marks, figures, and similitudes; that Christ is not bodily present, but only in virtue and operation from his Divine essence; but that in heaven"

Although there are these disagreements, yet all the Reformed agree in this: that it is altogether necessary that they should do the work of repentance who desire to receive that holy supper worthily; the Lutherans insist that if they do not do repentance from evil works, and yet approach, they are eternally condemned; and the English, that otherwise the devil will enter into them as he did into Judas; this is evident from the prayers read before the communion. “9. Of free will. They make a distinction between the state before the fall, after the fall, after the reception of faith and renovation, and after the resurrection. That man since the fall is entirely incapable of beginning, thinking, understanding, believing, willing, operating or cooperating anything from his own power in spiritual and Divine things; or of applying or accommodating himself to grace; but that his natural will is only for those things which are contrary to God, and displease him; thus that man in spiritual things is like a stock, but that still he has a capacity, not active, but passive, whereby he can be turned to good by the grace of God; that nevertheless there remains in man since the fall, the free will and power either to hear or not to hear the Word of God, and that thus a spark of faith may be kindled in his heart, which embraces the remission of sins for Christ’s sake, and imparts consolation. That nevertheless the human will enjoys the liberty of doing civil justice, and of making choice of such things as are within the province of reason. “10. Of the church.

[2] It is similar in each and everything in the world; there is in them the spiritual, which is the inmost of the cause, and there is the natural, which is its effect, and these two make one; and the spiritual does not appear in the natural, because it is in it as the soul in the body, and as the inmost of the cause in the effect, as was said before. It is similar with the Word; that this in its bosom is spiritual, because it is Divine, can be denied by no one; but as the spiritual does not appear in the sense of the letter, which is natural, therefore the spiritual sense has been hitherto unknown; nor could it have been known before genuine truths were revealed by the Lord, for that sense is in these. For this reason Revelation has not been understood before. But lest there should be doubt that such things are within it, the particulars must be explained, and demonstrated by similar passages elsewhere in the Word. The explanation and demonstration now follow. 2. Verse 1. The revelation of Jesus Christ signifies predictions from the Lord concerning himself and his church, what the latter will be in its end, and what it will be afterwards, as well in the heavens as upon earth. By “the revelation of Jesus Christ” are signified all predictions, which because they are from the Lord, are called the Revelation of Jesus Christ; that they relate to the Lord and his church, will appear from the explanations. In Revelation it does not treat of the successive states of the church, still less of the successive states of kingdoms, as some have hitherto believed, but there from beginning to end it treats of the last state of the church in the heavens and on the earth; and then concerning the last judgment; and after this of the new church, which is the new Jerusalem. That this new church is the end of this work, is evident, wherefore those things which precede refer to the state of the church, as to its quality just before it. But in what series these are treated of, may be seen from the contents of each chapter; and more distinctly from the explanation of each particular verse."

By “showing” is signified to manifest, and by “servants” are here signified those who are in faith from charity; to them these things are manifested, because they understand and receive them. By servants, in the spiritual sense, are meant those who are in truths; and because truths are from good, by servants are meant those who are in truths from good, thus also, those who are in wisdom from love, because wisdom is of truth, and love is of good; also those who are in faith derived from charity, because faith also is of truth and charity is of good; and as the genuine spiritual sense is abstracted from person, therefore in it by servants are signified truths. Now as truths are serviceable to good by teaching it, therefore, in general, and properly, by “servant” in the Word is meant what is serviceable, or he or that which serves; in this sense not only the prophets are called the servants of God, but also the Lord as to his human; that the prophets are called the servants of God is evident from the following passages: Jehovah hath sent unto you all his servants the prophets (Jer. 25:4). He revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets (Amos 3:7). He set before you4 by the hand of his servants the prophets (Dan. 9:10); And Moses is called “The servant of Jehovah” (Mal. 4:4). The reason is that by a prophet in the spiritual sense is meant the truth of doctrine, as explained below. [2] And because the Lord was the Divine truth itself, which also is the Word, and from this was himself called the prophet; and served in the world, and serves all to eternity by teaching, therefore, he also, in many places, is called the servant of Jehovah; as in the following passages: He shall see of the labor of his soul, and shall be satisfied; by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many (Isa. 53:11)."

Behold, my servant, on whom I lean, mine elect, in whom my soul hath good pleasure, I have put my spirit upon him (Isa. 42:1, 19); this is spoken of the Lord: in like manner David is called a servant, where, by him, the Lord is meant; as in the following passages: And I Jehovah will be their God, and my servant David a prince in the midst of them (Ezek. 34:24). My servant, David, shall be king over them, that there may be one shepherd to them all (Ezek. 37:24). I will protect this city to preserve it, for my sake and my servant David’s (Isa. 37:35). So also in Psalm 78:70–72, 89:3–4, 20. That by David in these places is meant the Lord, may be seen in Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Lord (n. 43–44). The Lord himself says the same of himself: Whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister, and whosoever will be first let him be your servant, as the son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister (Matt. 20:25–28; Mark 10:42–44; Luke 22:27; likewise Luke 12:37). This the Lord says, because by servant and minister is meant one who serves and ministers by teaching, and abstractly from person, the Divine truth, which was himself. [3] Since, therefore, by servant is meant he who teaches Divine truth, it is evident that by servants in this place in Revelation are meant those who are in truths from good, or in faith from charity, because these can teach from the Lord, that is, the Lord can teach and minister through them. In this sense they are called servants in Matthew:"

And in Luke: Blessed are those servants, whom the Lord when he cometh, shall find watching: verily, I say unto you, that he shall gird himself, and make them to recline, and shall himself come near and minister unto them (Luke 12:37). In heaven all are called servants of the Lord who are in his spiritual kingdom; but they who are in his celestial kingdom are called ministers; the reason is, that they who are in his spiritual kingdom, are in wisdom from Divine truth; and they who are in his celestial kingdom are in love from Divine good; and good ministers and truth serves. But in the opposite sense, by servants are meant those who serve the devil; these are in a state of servitude itself; but they who serve the Lord are in a state of liberty; as the Lord also teaches (John 8:32–36). 4.

[3] It was said that in the Divine idea there is not time, but the presence of all things past and future; wherefore it is said in David: A thousand years in thy sight are as yesterday (Ps. 90:4); I will declare the decree, Jehovah hath said unto me, Thou art my son, this day have I begotten thee (Ps. 2:7). “This day” is the presence of the Lord’s advent.

And he signified, sending by his angel to his servant John signifies the things which are revealed from the Lord through heaven to those who are in the good of life from charity and its faith. By “he signified, sending by his angel,” in the spiritual sense, is meant the things which are revealed from heaven, or through heaven by the Lord: for by “angel” in the Word is everywhere meant the angelic heaven, and in the supreme sense the Lord himself; the reason is, that no angel ever speaks with man separate from heaven; for there is such a conjunction there of each with all, that everyone speaks from the communion, although the angel is not conscious of it. For heaven in the sight of the Lord is as one man, whose soul is the Lord himself; wherefore the Lord speaks with man through heaven, as man does from his soul through his body with another; and this is done in conjunction with all and each of the things of his mind, in the midst of which are the things which he speaks. But this arcanum cannot be unfolded in a few words. It is partly unfolded in Angelic Wisdom concerning Divine Love and Divine Wisdom. Hence it is evident, that by “an angel” is signified heaven, and in the supreme sense the Lord. The reason why by “angel” the Lord is meant in the supreme sense is because heaven is not heaven from"

Hence it is that the Lord himself is called “angel” in the Word. From these things it is manifest that the angel did not speak from himself with John; but the Lord by means of heaven through him. [2] By these words is meant, that they were revealed to those who are in the good of life from charity and its faith, because these are meant by “John.” For by the “twelve disciples” or “apostles” of the Lord, are meant all who are of the church in truths from good; and in the abstract sense, all things of the church; and by “Peter,” all who are in faith, and, abstractly, faith itself; by “James,” they who are in charity, and, abstractly, charity itself; by “John,” they who are in the good of life from charity and its faith, and, abstractly, the good of life itself therefrom. That these things are meant by “John,” “James,” and “Peter” in the Word of the evangelists, may be seen in New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine, published at London in the year 1758 (n. 122). [3] Since the good of life from charity and its faith makes the church, therefore through the apostle John were revealed the arcana concerning the state of the church which are contained in his visions. That by all the names of persons and places in the Word are signified things of heaven and the church, is shown in many places in Arcana Coelestia, also published at London. From these things it may appear, that by “he signified, sending by his angel to his servant John” is meant in the spiritual sense, what is revealed by the Lord through heaven to those who are in the good of life from charity and its faith; for charity through faith operates good, and not charity by itself, nor faith by itself. 6. Verse 2.

These “testify,” that is, see, acknowledge, receive from the heart in the light, and confess the truths of the Word, especially that truth therein that the Lord’s human is Divine; which may be evident from the passages quoted from the Word in great abundance in Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Lord. By “Jesus Christ” and by “the lamb” in Revelation is meant the Lord as to the Divine human, and by “God,” the Lord as to his Divine, from which are all things. [2] With regard to the spiritual signification of “testifying,” this is predicated of truth, because in the world the truth is to be testified, and when it is testified, it is acknowledged. But in heaven truth testifies of itself because it is itself the light of heaven. For when the angels hear the truth, they immediately know and acknowledge it; and because the Lord is the truth itself, as he himself teaches in John 14:6, he is in heaven the testimony of himself. Hence it may appear what is meant by “the testimony of Jesus Christ”; wherefore the Lord says: Ye sent unto John, and he testified unto the truth; but I receive not testimony from man (John 5:33–34). John came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light; he was not that light; the Word which was with God, and was God, and became flesh, was the true light, which lighteth every man (John 1:1–2, 7–8, 14, 34). Jesus said, Though I testify of myself, yet my testimony is true, for I know whence I came, and whither I go (John 8:14). When the comforter has come, even the spirit of truth, he shall testify of me (John 15:26). By the comforter, the spirit of truth, is meant the truth itself proceeding from the Lord, wherefore it is said of it that it will not speak from itself, but from the Lord (John 16:13–15)."

These see in the visions of John, the arcana concerning the state of the church, not so much when they read them, but when they see them revealed. Moreover to see signifies to understand; on this account in common discourse it is said, that one sees a thing, and he sees that it is the truth; for man has sight as to his spirit as well as to his body. But man with his spirit sees spiritual things, because from the light of heaven, but with his body he sees natural things; because this sees from the light of the world, and spiritual things are real, but natural things are their forms. It is the spiritual sight of man which is called the understanding. From these things it is evident what is meant, in the spiritual sense, by “whatsoever things he saw;” in like manner in what follows, where it is said that he saw. 8. Verse 3.

By “the words of the prophecy” nothing else is meant than the doctrine of the new Jerusalem, for by “prophet,” in the abstract sense, is signified the doctrine of the church derived from the Word, thus here the doctrine of the new church, which is the new Jerusalem; the same is signified by “prophecy.” By “reading, hearing, and keeping the things which are written therein” is signified, to desire to know that doctrine; to attend to the things which are in it, and to do the things which are therein; in short, to live according to it.

From this also is every man, spirit, and angel named there. Therefore, when a prophet is mentioned, because his function was to write and teach the Word, the Word is meant as to doctrine, or doctrine from the Word. Hence it is that the Lord, because he is the Word itself, was called the prophet (Deut. 18:15–20, Matt. 13:57, chap. 21:11, Luke 13:33). To show that by “prophet” is meant the doctrine of the church from the Word, some passages shall be adduced, from which this may be collected. In Matthew: In the consummation of the age many false prophets shall rise up, and shall seduce many. There shall arise false Christs and false prophets, and if possible they shall lead the elect into error (Matt. 24:11, 24). “The consummation of the age” is the last time of the church, which is now, when there are not false prophets, but falsities of doctrine. [3] In the same: He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet, shall receive a prophet’s reward; and he that receiveth a just man in the name of a just man, shall receive a just man’s reward (Matt. 10:41). “To receive a prophet in the name of a prophet” is to receive the truth of doctrine because it is true; and “to receive a just man in the name of a just man” is to receive good for the sake of good; and “to receive a reward” is to be saved according to reception. It is evident that no one receives a reward, or is saved, because he receives a prophet and a just man in the name of such. Those words cannot be understood by anyone, without a knowledge of what “a prophet” and “a just man” signify; nor can those which follow: Whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only, in the name of a disciple, shall not lose his reward (Matt. 10:42)."

This is concerning the church which was to be established by the Lord, in which they would not prophesy, but receive doctrine, which is to “prophesy.” In Matthew: Jesus said, Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? but then will I confess unto them, I have not known you; depart from me, ye that work iniquity (Matt. 7:22–23). Who does not see, that they will not say that they have prophesied, but that they knew the doctrine of the church, and taught it? In Revelation: The time is come for judging the dead and for giving reward to the prophets (Rev. 11:18); Exult, O heaven, and holy apostles and prophets, for God hath judged your judgment (Rev. 18:20). It is evident that a reward would not be given to the prophets alone, and that the apostles and prophets would not alone exult at the last judgment, but all who have received the truths of doctrine, and have lived according to them. These, therefore, are meant by “apostles” and “prophets.” [5] In Moses: Jehovah said unto Moses, I have made thee a god to Pharaoh, and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet (Exod. 7:1); “a god” here means the Divine truth as to reception from the Lord, in which sense the angels are also called gods, and by “prophet” is"

John to the seven churches signifies to all who are in the Christian world where the Word is, and by it the Lord is known, and who draw near to the church. By the “seven churches” are not meant seven churches, but all who are of the church in the Christian world; for numbers, in the Word, signify things, and “seven,” all things and all, and thence, also, what is full and perfect, and it occurs in the Word where anything holy is treated of, and in the opposite sense, of anything profane; consequently, this number involves what is holy, and, in the opposite sense, what is profane. The reason why numbers signify things, or rather resemble certain adjectives to substantives adding some quality to the things, is, because number is, in itself, natural; for natural things are determined by numbers, but spiritual things by things and their states. Therefore, he who does not know the signification of numbers in the Word, and especially in Revelation, cannot know the many arcana which are contained therein.

While speaking with them they said that they worship Jehovah, some as an invisible, and some as a visible God. Moreover they related that they do not suffer foreigners to come among them, except the Chinese, with whom they cultivate peace, because the emperor of China is from their country. And further, that they are so populous, that they do not believe any region in the whole world to be more populous; which is very credible from the wall so many miles long, which the Chinese formerly constructed as a safeguard against invasion from them. Seek for it in China, and peradventure you will find it there among the Tartars. 12. Grace be unto you and peace signifies Divine salutation. What is understood specifically by “grace and peace,” will be explained in what follows; that “peace be unto you” was the Lord’s salutation to his disciples, thus the Divine salutation, may be seen in Luke (24:36, 37); John (20:19–21); and by command of the Lord, it was the salutation of the disciples to all to whom they should enter in (Matt. 10:11–15). 13. From him who is, who was, and is to come signifies from the Lord who is eternal and infinite, and Jehovah. That it is the Lord, appears clearly from what follows in this chapter, where it is said that he heard a voice from the son of man, saying: I am alpha and omega, the first and the last (Rev. 1:11–13); and afterwards: I am the first and the last (Rev. 1:17); and in the following chapter (Rev. 1:8); and afterwards (Rev. 21:6; 22:12); and in Isaiah: Thus saith Jehovah, the king of Israel, and his redeemer Jehovah of hosts: I am the first, and I am the last, and besides me there is no God (Isa. 44:6);"

This also is acknowledged by the church in the doctrine of the trinity, called Athanasian, in which are these words: “The Father is eternal and infinite, the son is eternal and infinite, and the Holy Spirit is eternal and infinite, but yet there are not three eternals and infinites, but one;” that this one is the Lord, is demonstrated in Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Lord. 14. And from the seven spirits who are before his throne signifies, from the whole heaven where the Lord is in his Divine truth, and where his Divine truth is received. By “seven spirits” are meant all who are in the Divine truth, and in the abstract sense, the Divine true or Divine truth itself. That “seven” in the Word means all and all things, may be seen above (n. 10); and that by “throne” is meant the whole heaven, will be seen presently. Hence by “before his throne” is meant where his Divine truth is; for heaven is not heaven from anything proper to the angels, but from the Divine of the Lord, as is shown in many places in Angelic Wisdom concerning Divine Providence and Divine Love and Wisdom. That “the Lord’s throne” signifies heaven is evident from the following passages: Jehovah saith, The heavens are my throne (Isa. 66:1). Jehovah hath made firm his throne in the heavens (Ps. 103:19). He that sweareth by heaven, sweareth by the throne of God, and by him who sitteth thereon (Matt. 23:22). Above the expanse that was over the head of the cherubim, was as it were, the appearance of a sapphire stone, the likeness of a throne, and upon it the appearance of a man (Ezek. 1:26; 10:1)."

That “witness” is predicated of truth, and that the truth testifies of itself, thus the Lord, who is the Divine Truth itself, and the Word, may be seen above (n. 6). 17. The first-born from the dead signifies that he is the Divine Good itself. What “the first-born from the dead” means, no one as yet knows; and the ancients disputed what it signifies. They knew that by “the first-born” is signified what is first and primary, from which is the all of the church; and it was believed by many, that it was truth in doctrine and in faith; but by few, that it was truth in act and work, which is the good of life. That this is the first and primary of the church, and thence in the proper sense is meant by “the first-born,” will be seen presently. But first something shall be said concerning the opinion of those who believed, that truth in doctrine and in faith is the first and primary of the church, thus the first-born. They believed this, because it is learned first, and because a church is a church by means of truth, though not before it is of the life. Previously it is only in the thought of the understanding, and in the memory, and not in the act of the will; and truth, which is not truth in act or work, does not live. It is only like a luxuriant tree having branches and leaves without fruit.

[2] With the understanding it is similar, which is formed in man first, but to the end that what a man sees with his understanding, he may do; otherwise the understanding is like a preacher who teaches well but lives wickedly. Moreover all truth is sown in the internal man, and rooted in the external; wherefore, unless the truth that is inseminated takes root in the external man, which is effected by doing, it becomes like a tree planted, not in the soil, but upon it, which immediately withers on exposure to the heat of the sun. The man who has done the truth, takes this root with him after death; but not the man who had only known and acknowledged it in faith. Now because many of the ancients made that which is first in time, the first also in end, that is, primary; therefore they said, that the first-born signified truth in doctrine and faith in the church; not knowing that this is the first-born apparently, but not actually. [3] But all those who have made truth in doctrine and in faith the primary, are condemned, because there is nothing of deed or work, or nothing of life in that truth. Therefore Cain, who was the first-born of Adam and Eve, was condemned. That by him is signified truth in doctrine and in faith, may be seen in Angelic Wisdom concerning Divine Providence (n. 242). Therefore, also Reuben, who was the first-born of Jacob, was condemned by his father (Genesis 49:3–4), and his birthright was taken from him (1 Chron. 5:1). That by “Reuben” in the spiritual sense, is meant truth in doctrine and in faith, will be seen presently. By “the first- born of Egypt,” who were all smitten, because condemned, nothing else is meant in the spiritual sense, than truth in doctrine and in faith separate from the good of life, which truth is in itself dead. By the “goats” in Daniel and in Matthew, no others are meant than those who are in faith separate from life, concerning whom see Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning Faith (n. 61–68). That"

[4] From these few things it may appear that truth in doctrine and in faith is not the first-born of the church; but truth in act or work, which is the good of life; for the church is not with man until the truth becomes of the life, and when the truth becomes of the life, then it is good; for the thought of the understanding, and the memory, do not flow into the will, and through the will into act; but the will flows into the thought of the understanding, and into the memory, and acts. And what proceeds from the will, through the understanding, proceeds from affection, which is of love, through the thought, which is of the understanding, and all this is called good, and it enters into the life; wherefore the Lord saith that: He who doeth the truth, doeth it in God (John 3:21). [5] Because John represents the good of life, and Peter the truth of faith, as may be seen above (n. 5), therefore: John leaned on the Lord’s breast, and followed Jesus, but not Peter (John 21:18–21). The Lord also said of John, that “he should tarry till he came” (verse 22–23); thus to this day, which is the Lord’s coming; the good of life is therefore now taught by the Word for those who will be of his new church, which is the new Jerusalem. In a summary, that is the first-born which the truth first produces from good, thus what the understanding produces from the will; because truth is of the understanding, and good is of the will: this first is primary, because it is as the seed from which the rest proceed. [6] As to the Lord he is the first-born from the dead, because he, as to his human, is the truth itself united to the Divine good, from whom all men live, who in themselves are dead.

Thence it is that Israel is called the first-born (Exod. 4:22, 23). By “Israel” is meant the truth in act, and by “Jacob” the truth in doctrine; and because there is no church from the latter alone, therefore Jacob was named Israel. [7] But in the supreme sense by “Israel” is meant the Lord. On account of this representation of the “first-born,” all the first-born and all the first fruits were sanctified to Jehovah (Exod. 13:2, 12; 22:28, 29). On account of this representation of the “first-born,” the Levites were taken instead of all the first-born in the Israelitish church; and it is said that thereby they belonged to Jehovah (Num. 3:12, 13, 40–46; 18:15–18): for by “Levi” is signified truth in act, which is the good of life; and therefore the priesthood was given to his posterity, which will be treated of below. For the same reason a double portion of the inheritance was given to the first-born, and he was called “the beginning of strength” (Deut. 21:15–17). [8] The “first-born” signifies the primary of the church, because in the Word by natural births, spiritual births are signified, and then what first produces them in man, is meant by his “first-born”; for there is no church with him, until the truth of doctrine conceived in the internal man is born in the external. 18. And the prince of the kings of the earth signifies from whom is all truth from good in the church. This follows from what has gone before, because by faithful witness, the Lord as to the Divine truth is signified; and by first-born the Lord as to the Divine good; therefore by “the prince of the earth” is signified, that all truth from good in the church is from him. The reason why this is signified by “the prince of the kings of the earth” is, that by “kings” in the spiritual sense of the Word, are meant those that are in truths from good, and abstractly, truths from good; and by “earth” is meant the church. That this is the signification of “kings” and “earth,” may be seen below (n. 20, 285)."

That “to wash us from our sins” is to purify us from evils, thus to reform and regenerate, is evident; for regeneration is spiritual washing. But that by “his blood” is not meant the passion of the cross, as many believe, but the Divine truth proceeding from him, may appear from many passages in the Word, which it would be too prolix to adduce here, but they will be adduced below (n. 379, 653). In the meantime, see what is said and shown concerning the signification of the Lord’s flesh and blood in the holy supper, as set forth in New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine, published at London in the year 1758 (n. 210–222); and concerning spiritual washing, which is regeneration, in the same (n. 202–209). 20. Verse 6. And maketh us kings and priests signifies who gives to those who are born of him, that is, who are regenerated, to be in wisdom from Divine truths, and in love from Divine goods. It is known that in the Word the Lord is called “king,” and also “priest”; he is called “king” from Divine wisdom, and “priest” from Divine love; therefore, they who are in wisdom from the Lord are called “sons of the king,” and also “kings”; and they who are in love from him, are called “ministers” and “priests”; for the wisdom and love with them is not from themselves, thus not their own, but the Lord’s. Hence it is that these are meant in the Word by “kings” and “priests”; not that they are such, but that the Lord is such in them, and causes them to be so called. They are also called “born of him,” “sons of the kingdom,” “sons of the Father,” and “heirs”; “born of him” (John 1:12, 13), that is, born again, or regenerated (John 3:3 seq.); “sons of the kingdom” (Matt. 8:12; 13:38); “sons of the Father in heaven” (Matt. 5:45); “heirs” (Ps. 127:3; 1 Sam. 2:8; Matt. 25:34); and because they are called heirs, sons of the kingdom, and born of the Lord as their Father, they are called “kings and priests”; then also it is said that: They will sit with the Lord upon his throne (Rev. 3:21)."

Unto God and his Father signifies thus images of his Divine wisdom, and of his Divine love. By “God and Father,” in the spiritual sense, two persons are not meant; but by “God” is meant the Divine as to wisdom, and by “Father” the Divine as to love; for there are two things in the Lord, the Divine wisdom and the Divine love, or the Divine truth and the Divine good; these two are meant in the Old Testament by “God” and “Jehovah,” and here, by “God” and “Father.” Now because the Lord teaches, that he and the Father are one, and that he is in the Father and the Father in him (John 10:30; 14:10, 11), by God and the Father are not meant two persons, but the Lord alone.

That such is the meaning of “glory,” “might,” and “ages of ages,” when spoken of Jehovah or the Lord, may be confirmed from many passages in the Word. 23. Amen signifies Divine confirmation from the truth, thus from himself. “Amen” signifies truth; and because the Lord was truth itself, he so often said, “Amen, I say unto you,” (as in Matt. 5:18, 26; 6:16; 10:23, 42; 17:20; 18:13, 18; 25:12; 28:20; John 3:11; 5:19, 24, 25; 6:26, 32, 47, 53; 8:34, 51, 58; 10:7; 13:16, 20, 21; 21:18, 25); and in the following passage in Revelation: These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness (Rev. 3:14); that is, the Lord.

But this idea falls, when it is known what “a cloud” is, and that it is the Divine truth in ultimates, thus the Word in the sense of the letter. [2] In the spiritual world there appear clouds as well as in the natural world; but the clouds in the spiritual world appear beneath the heavens, with those who are in the sense of the letter of the Word, darker or brighter according to their understanding and reception of the Word; the reason is, that the light of heaven there is the Divine truth, and darkness there is falsities; consequently “bright clouds” are the Divine truth veiled in appearances of truth, such as the Word is in the letter with those who are in truths; and “dark clouds” are the Divine truths covered with fallacies and confirmed appearances, such as the Word is in the letter with those who are in falsities. I have often seen those clouds, and it was evident whence and what they are.

[7] Divine truth in ultimates, which is the same with the Word in the sense of the letter, is also represented by the “cloud,” in which Jehovah descended upon Mount Sinai, and promulgated the law (Exod. 19:9; 34:5). Also by the “cloud” which covered Peter, James, and John, when Jesus was transfigured, concerning which it is written: While Peter yet spake, behold a cloud overshadowed them, and behold a voice out of the cloud saying, This is my beloved son, hear ye him (Matt. 17:5; Mark 9:7; Luke 9:34–35). The Lord in this transfiguration, caused himself to be seen as the Word; therefore a cloud overshadowed them, and a voice was heard out of the cloud, that he is the son of God; “the voice out of the cloud” is out of the Word. That by “cloud,” in the opposite sense, is meant the Word as to the sense of the letter falsified, will be seen elsewhere. 25. And every eye shall see him signifies that all who are in the understanding of Divine truth from affection will acknowledge him. In the spiritual sense, by “eye” is not meant the eye, but the understanding; therefore, “every eye shall see him” signifies that all who are in the understanding of Divine truth from affection will acknowledge him, because they alone understand and acknowledge. The rest see indeed and also understand, but do not acknowledge; the former, then, are signified, because it follows, that “they also who pierced him” will see him, by whom are meant those who are in falsities. That “the eye” signifies the understanding, will be seen below (n. 48)."

By “piercing” Jesus Christ nothing else is meant than to destroy his Divine truth in the Word. This, also, is meant by: One of the soldiers pierced his side, and there went forth blood and water (John 19:34.) “Blood and water” are the Divine truth, spiritual and natural, thus the Word in its spiritual and in its natural sense; and “to pierce the Lord’s side” is to destroy both by falsities, as was also done by the Jews; for all things of the Lord’s passion represented the state of the Jewish church as to the Word, on which subject, see Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Lord (n. 15–17). The reason why “piercing” him signifies to destroy the Word by falsities, is, because this is said of Jesus Christ, who presently is called the son of man, and by the son of man is meant the Lord as to the Word, therefore “to pierce the son of man” is to do the same to the Word. 27. And all the tribes of the earth shall wail signifies that this will be when there are no longer any goods and truths in the church. That “the tribes of the earth” signify the goods and truths of the church, will be seen in the explanation of the seventh chapter, where the twelve tribes of Israel are treated of; “wailing” signifies lamentation that they are dead. The same is meant here as by the Lord’s words in Matthew: After the affliction of those days the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven; and then shall appear the sign of the son of man, and then shall all the tribes of the earth wail (Matt. 24:29–30). These things are said of the consummation of the age, which is the end of the church; “the sun shall be darkened” signifies that there is no longer any love and charity; “the moon shall not give her light” signifies that there is no longer any intelligence and faith; “the stars shall fall from heaven” signifies that there are no longer any knowledges of good and truth; “all the tribes of the earth shall wail”"

And I am alpha and omega, the beginning and the end signifies who is the self-existing and the only from firsts to ultimates, from whom all things are; thus who is love itself and the only love, wisdom itself and the only wisdom, life itself and the only life in himself, and thus the creator himself and the only creator, savior, and enlightener from himself, and thence the all in all of heaven and the church. These and many more things besides are contained in the above words, by which the Lord is described. That they are spoken of the Lord, and, indeed, of his human, is very evident, for it follows that John heard a voice, saying: I am alpha and omega, the first and the last; and he turned to see the voice that spake with him, and saw the son of man in the midst of seven lampstands (Rev. 1:10–13). Who, also, a little further on, says: I am the first and the last, I am he that liveth and was dead (Rev. 2:8). But that all the particulars above enumerated are contained in these words cannot be confirmed briefly, for to confirm them fully would require many sheets; still they are in part confirmed in Angelic Wisdom concerning Divine Love and Wisdom, recently published in Amsterdam, which see. The Lord calls himself “Alpha and omega, the beginning and the end,” because “alpha and omega” refer to his Divine love, and “beginning and end,” to his Divine wisdom; for there is, in every particular of the Word, a marriage of love and wisdom, or of good and truth; on which subject, see Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Sacred Scripture (n. 80–90)."

      "text": "APOCALYPSE REVEALED 61 [2] The Lord is called “alpha and omega,” because alpha is the first letter and omega the last in the Greek alphabet, and therefore they signify all in the aggregate. The reason is that every letter of the alphabet in the spiritual world signifies something; and a vowel, because it is serviceable for sound, something of affection or love. From this origin, spiritual and angelic speech, and also the Scriptures, are derived; but this is an arcanum hitherto unknown. For there is a universal language in which all angels and spirits are; and this has nothing in common with any language of men in the world. Every man comes into this language after death; for it is implanted in every man from creation, therefore they all can understand each other in the whole spiritual world. It has been granted me frequently to hear that language, and also to speak it; and I have compared it with the languages in the world, and have found that it does not, even in the smallest particular, make one with any natural language on the earth. It differs from these in its first principle, which is, that each letter of every word has a sense and signification peculiar to itself, as well in speaking as in writing. Therefore it is that the Lord is called alpha and omega, which signifies that he is the all in all of heaven and the church; and as these two letters are vowels, they have relation to love, as was said above. Concerning this language, and the writing of it, flowing from the spiritual thought of the angels, something may be seen in Angelic Wisdom concerning Divine Love and Wisdom (n. 295). 30. Saith the Lord, who is, and who was, and who is to come. That this signifies who is eternal and infinite, and Jehovah, may be seen above (n. 13), where this is explained. 31. The Almighty signifies who is, lives, and has power from himself, and who rules all things from firsts by ultimates. Since all things are from the Lord, and are created from the firsts which are from him; and nothing is given which does not exist therefrom, as is abundantly shown in Angelic Wisdom concerning Divine Love and Wisdom, it follows, that he is omnipotent. Suppose one from whom are all things; are not all things of that one, upon whom they depend in order, like the links of a chain upon their hook; or like the blood vessels of the whole body upon the heart; or as each"

Thus do all things depend on the Lord, who is the sun of the spiritual world, from whom is all the essence, life, and power, with those who are under that sun. In a word, “from him we live, and move, and have our being” (Acts 17:28). This is the Divine omnipotence. That the Lord rules all things from firsts by ultimates, is an arcanum never before revealed; but it is now explained in Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Lord and Doctrine of the Sacred Scripture in many places; and also in Angelic Wisdom concerning Divine Providence (n. 124) and Divine Love and Wisdom (n. 221). It is known that the Divine because it is infinite, does not fall into the ideas of the thought of any man nor of any angel, because they are finite, and the finite does not have the capacity of perceiving the infinite; still, that it may in some manner be perceived, it has pleased the Lord to describe his infinity by these words: I am alpha and omega, the beginning and the end; who is, and who was, and who is to come, the almighty (Rev. 1:8). These words, therefore, include all things which angel and man can ever think, spiritually and naturally, concerning the Divine; which things, in general, are what were adduced above universally. 32. Verse 9. I, John, who also am your brother and companion signifies those who are in the good of charity, and thence in the truths of faith. It was said above (n. 5), that the apostle John represented those who are in the good of charity; and those who are in the good of charity are also in the truths of faith, because charity is the soul and life of faith; hence it is, that John calls himself the brother and companion of those in the church to whom he writes, for he wrote to the seven churches. By “brother,” in the spiritual sense of the Word, is meant one who is in the good of charity; and by “companion” one who is thence in the truths of faith; for all are, as it were, in consanguinity by charity, but in affinity by faith; for charity conjoins; not so faith, except it be from charity. When faith is from charity, then charity conjoins, and faith consociates; and since they make one, therefore the Lord commanded that all should be “brethren,” for he says:"

By “mother” is meant the church, and by “brethren,” those who are in charity; and because the good of charity is a “brother,” therefore the Lord calls those who are in it “brethren,” also in Matt. 25:40, and so also disciples (Matt. 28:10; John 20:17). But we do not read that the disciples called the Lord brother, because “brother” is the good which is from the Lord; this is comparatively as it is with a king, prince, and magnate, who call their relatives and neighbors brethren, but yet the latter do not in their turn call them so; for the Lord says: One is your teacher, Christ, but all ye are brethren (Matt. 23:8); Ye call me master and Lord; and ye say rightly, for so I am (John 13:13). [3] The sons of Israel called all those brethren who were from their father Jacob; and in a more extensive sense, those also who were from Esau; but such as were not from them they called companions. But because the Word, in its spiritual sense, treats only of those who are in the Lord’s church, therefore in that sense, by “brethren,” are meant those who are in the good of charity from the Lord, and by “companions,” those who are in the truths of faith; as in the following passages: Thus shall ye say everyone to his companion, and everyone to his brother, What hath Jehovah answered? (Jer. 23:35). Ye have not proclaimed liberty everyone to his brother, and everyone to his companion (Jer. 34:17). Let no one press his companion, nor his brother (Deut. 15:1, 2)."

I will mingle Egypt with Egypt, that one may fight against his brother, and against his companion (Isa. 19:2); and in other places. These are adduced, that it may be known why John calls himself “brother and companion”; and that by “brother” in the Word, is meant one who is in charity or in good, and by “companion” one who is in faith or in truth. But because charity is from faith, therefore none are called “companions” by the Lord, but “brethren” or “neighbor”; everyone also is a neighbor according to the quality of good (Luke 10:36–37). 33. In affliction and in the kingdom and patient expectation of Jesus Christ signifies which in the church are infested by evils and falsities, but which will be removed by the Lord when he comes. By “affliction” is meant the state of the church when there are no longer any goods of charity and truths of faith, but in place of them evils and falsities; by “the kingdom” is meant the church; and, by “patient expectation of Jesus Christ” is meant the Lord’s coming; therefore these words, “In affliction and in the kingdom and patient expectation of Jesus Christ,” when collated into one sense, signify when the goods and truths of the church are infested by evils and falsities, but which will be removed by the Lord when he comes. That by “affliction” is meant the state of the church when it is infested by evils and falsities, is evident from the following: In the consummation of the age, they shall deliver you up into affliction, and shall kill you. There shall be great affliction, such as was not from the beginning of the world, nor shall be.

From which it is evident, that “I became in the spirit on the Lord’s day” signifies a spiritual state then from Divine influx. Of the prophets we read that they were “in the spirit” or “in vision,” also that the Word came to them from Jehovah. When they were in the spirit or in vision, they were not in the body, but in their spirit, in which state they saw such things as are in heaven; but when the Word came to them, then they were in the body, and heard Jehovah speaking. These two states of the prophets are to be carefully distinguished. In the state of vision the eyes of their spirit were opened, and the eyes of their body shut; and then they heard what the angels spoke; or what Jehovah spoke through the angels, and they also saw the things which were represented to them in heaven; and then they sometimes seemed to themselves to be carried from place to place, the body remaining in its place."

It is said also that the spirit took him up, and he heard behind him an earthquake, and other things (Ezek. 3:12, 24); also that: The spirit lifted him up between the earth and heaven, and brought him in the visions of God to Jerusalem, and he saw abominations (Ezek. 8:3 seq.).

I can testify that it is so, from the experience of many years. In this state the disciples were when they saw the Lord after his resurrection, wherefore it is said that: “Their eyes were opened” (Luke 24:30, 31). Abraham was in a similar state when he saw the three angels, and spoke with them.

And I heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet signifies manifest perception of the Divine truth revealed from heaven. “A great voice,” when heard from heaven signifies the Divine truth, of which presently; it was heard “as a trumpet,” because when the Divine truth descends from heaven, it is sometimes so heard by the angels of the lowest heaven, and then is manifestly perceived. Therefore, by “a voice as of a trumpet” is signified manifest perception; of the signification of trumpet, more will be seen below (n. 397, 519). That “a great voice” when heard from heaven signifies Divine truth is evident from these passages: The voice of Jehovah is upon the water, the voice of Jehovah is in power, the voice of Jehovah is with honor, the voice of Jehovah breaketh the cedars, the voice of Jehovah falleth as a flame of fire; the voice of Jehovah maketh the wilderness to tremble; the voice of Jehovah maketh the hinds to bring forth (Ps. 29:3–9).

And since “voice” signifies the Divine truth from the Lord, therefore the Lord said that: The sheep hear his voice; they know his voice; and other sheep I have, them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; my sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me (John 10:3–4, 16, 27).

That all these things, and infinitely more, are contained in these words, may be seen above (n. 13, 29).

Since every letter signifies a thing in the spiritual world, and thence in the angelic language; therefore David wrote Psalm 119, in order, according to the letters of the alphabet, beginning with aleph and ending with thau, as may appear from the initials of the verses there; the like appears in Psalm 111, but not so evidently.

That by all the names of places and persons throughout the whole Word, are meant spiritual things, is shown in many places in Arcana Coelestia, published in London, as what is meant by “Abraham,” “Isaac,” and “Jacob”; also by “Israel,” and by the names of his twelve sons; as also, what is meant by various places in the land of Canaan, and by places in the vicinity of that land; as what by Egypt, Syria, Assyria, and other places.

And I turned to see the voice that spoke with me signifies inversion of the state of those who are in the good of life, as to the perception of truth in the Word, when they turn themselves to the Lord. John says that he heard a voice behind him (verse 10), and now that he turned to see the voice; and again, that being turned, he saw seven lampstands; from which it is evident, that he heard a voice from behind, and that he turned himself, to see from whence it proceeded; that there is an arcanum in this is evident. The arcanum is that before man turns himself to the Lord, and acknowledges him as the God of heaven and earth, he cannot see the Divine truth in the Word. The reason is, that God is one, both in person and in essence, in whom there is the trinity; and that God is the Lord. Therefore, they who acknowledge a trinity of persons, look primarily to the Father, and some to the Holy Spirit, and rarely to the Lord, and if to the Lord, they think of his human as of an ordinary man. When a man does this, he can by no means be enlightened in the Word, for the Lord is the Word, for it is from him and concerning him. Therefore they who do not approach the Lord alone, see him"

This is the arcanum which lies concealed in these words: “That John heard a voice behind him, and that he turned to see the voice, and, being turned, saw seven golden lampstands, and in the midst of them the son of man”; for the voice which he heard came from the son of man, who is the Lord. [2] That the Lord alone is the God of heaven and earth, he now teaches in a manifest voice, for he says: I am the alpha and the omega, the beginning and the end, saith the Lord, who is, and who was, and who is to come (Rev. 1:8); I am the alpha and the omega, the first and the last (Rev. 1:11); I am the first and the last (Rev. 1:17; 2:8). That by a “voice,” when from the Lord is meant the Divine truth, may be seen above (n. 37). And that by “John” are meant those of the church, who are in the good of life (n. 5–6). From these things it may now appear, that by the words “And I turned to see the voice which spake with me” is signified an inversion of the state of those who are in the good of life, as to the perception of truth in the Word, when they turn themselves to the Lord. 43. And having turned, I saw seven golden lampstands signifies the new church, which will be in enlightenment from the Lord out of the Word. That the “seven lampstands” are the seven churches, is said in the last verse of this chapter; and that by the seven churches are meant all who are in the Christian world, and draw near to the church, may be seen above (n. 10); and in particular according to the state of reception of each (n. 41). The reason why the new church is meant by “the seven lampstands” is because in it, and in the midst of it, the Lord is; for it is said, that “in the midst of the seven lampstands he saw one like unto the son of man,” and by “the son of man” is meant the Lord as to the Word. The lampstands were seen to be golden, because gold signifies good, and every church is a church from good which is formed by truths; that “gold” signifies good, will be seen in what follows."

Nothing is said of the lamps of those lampstands; but in what follows it is said that: The holy Jerusalem (that is, the new church), hath no need of the sun, neither of the moon, for its lamp is the lamb, and the nations which are saved shall walk in the light of it (Rev. 21:23–24). They need no lamp, for the Lord God giveth them light (Rev. 22:5); for they who will be of the Lord’s new church, are only lampstands which will give light from the Lord. [3] By the “golden lampstand in the tabernacle,” nothing else was represented than the church as to enlightenment from the Lord, concerning which lampstand see (Exod. 25:31 to the end; 37:17–24; Lev. 24:3, 4; Num. 8:2–4).

This explanation of that chapter was given me by the Lord through heaven. 44. Verse 13. And in the midst of the seven lampstands one like unto the son of man signifies the Lord as to the Word, from whom that church is. It is known from the Word, that the Lord called himself “the son of God,” and also “the son of man”; that by “the son of God” he meant himself as to the Divine human, and by the “son of man,” himself as to the Word, is fully demonstrated in Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Lord (n. 19–28); and as it is there fully confirmed from the Word, it is unnecessary to add any further confirmation here. Now, because the Lord represented himself before John as the Word, therefore as seen by him, he is called “the son of man.” He represented himself as the Word, because the new church is treated of, which is a church from the Word, and according to the understanding of it. That the church is from the Word, and that such as its understanding of the Word is, such is the church, may be seen in Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Sacred Scripture (n. 76–79). As the church is a church from the Lord through the Word, therefore the son of man was seen in the midst of the lampstands; “in the midst” signifies in the inmost, from which the things which are round about, or which are without, derive their essence, here, their light or intelligence. That the inmost is the all in the things which are round about, or without, is shown in many places in Angelic Wisdom concerning Divine Love and Wisdom; it is like light and flame in the midst, from which all the circumferences receive light and heat. [2] “In the midst,” has the same signification in the following passages in the Word: Cry out and shout, O inhabitant of Zion; for great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee (Isa. 12:6)."

They are called “gods” who are in Divine truths from the Lord, and, abstractly, the truths themselves: Behold, I send an angel before thee; beware of his face, for my name is in the midst of him (Exod. 23:20–21). “The name of Jehovah” is all the Divine; “in the midst” is in the inmost, and thence in everything of it. “The midst” also signifies the inmost, and thence the all, in many other passages in the Word, where evils are also treated of, as in Isa. 24:13; Jer. 23:9; Ps. 5:9; Jer. 9:4, 5; Ps. 36:1; 55:4; 62:4. These passages are adduced in order to show, that “in the midst of the lampstands” signifies in the inmost, from which the church and everything of it is derived; for the church and everything of it is from the Lord through the Word. That “lampstands” signify the new church, may be seen above (n. 43). 45. Clothed with a garment down to the foot signifies the proceeding Divine, which is the Divine truth. The reason why “a garment down to the foot” signifies the proceeding Divine, which is the Divine truth, is because garments in the Word signify truths, thence “a garment down to the foot” [talaris], which is an outer garment, when the Lord is treated of signifies the proceeding Divine truth. That garments in the Word signify truths is because in heaven they are clothed according to the truths proceeding from their good, concerning which see in Heaven and Hell, published in London in the year 1758 (n. 177–182). In what follows it will also be seen, that nothing else is meant by garments in the Word in its spiritual sense; therefore that nothing else is meant by the Lord’s garments, when he was transfigured, which appeared white as the light (Matt. 17:1–4; Mark 9:2–8; Luke 9:28–36).

Concerning the signification of garments from the Word, see below (n. 166, 328). 46. And girt about the paps with a golden girdle signifies the proceeding, and, at the same time, the conjoining Divine, which is the Divine good. That “a golden girdle” has this signification is because by “the Lord’s breast,” and especially by “the paps,” his Divine love is signified; thence, by “the golden girdle” which girded them is signified the proceeding and at the same time the conjoining Divine, which is the Divine good of the Divine love: moreover “gold” signifies good; see below (n. 913). “A zone” or “girdle” in the Word also signifies the common bond, whereby all things are held together in order and connection; as in Isaiah: There shall go forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, justice shall be the girdle of his loins, and truth the girdle of his thighs (Isa. 11:1, 5). “The rod going forth out of the stem of Jesse” is the Lord. That the girdle of the ephod and the belt of Aaron’s coat signified conjunction may be seen in Arcana Coelestia, published at London (n. 9837, 9944). Since “a girdle” signifies the bond conjoining the goods and truths of the church, therefore when the church with the sons of Israel was destroyed, Jeremiah the prophet was commanded: To buy himself a girdle, and put it upon his loins, and then to hide it in a hole of a rock near the Euphrates; and at the end of days, when he took it, behold it was rotten, and was profitable for nothing (Jer. 13:1–12). By this was represented that at that time there was no good in the church, and thence that truths were dissipated. The like is signified by “girdle” in Isaiah:"

That by the “paps” or “breasts” the Divine love is signified, is evident from those passages in the Word where they are named, as also from their correspondence with love. 47. Verse 14. And his head, and hairs, were white as wool, like snow signifies the Divine love of the Divine wisdom in firsts and in ultimates. By the head of man is signified the all of his life; and the all of man’s life has relation to love and wisdom, therefore by “the head” is signified wisdom, and also love. But as there is no love without its wisdom, nor wisdom without its love, therefore it is the love of wisdom, which is meant by “the head”; and when the Lord is spoken of, it is the Divine love of the Divine wisdom. But the signification of “the head” will be shown from the Word, below (n. 538, 568). Since, therefore, by “the head” is meant love and at the same time wisdom in their firsts, it follows that by “hair” is meant love and wisdom in their ultimates; and because “hairs” are here spoken of the son of man, who is the Lord as to the Word, by his “hairs” are signified the Divine good which is of love, and the Divine truth which is of wisdom, in the ultimates of the Word; and the ultimates of the Word are what are contained in the sense of its letter. [2] That the Word in this sense is signified by “the hairs of the son of man,” or of the Lord, seems a paradox, but yet it is true; this may appear from the passages in the Word quoted in Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Sacred Scripture (n. 35–49) where it is also shown, that the Nazarites in the Israelitish church represented the Lord as to the Word in ultimates, which is the sense of its letter. For “Nazarite,” in the Hebrew language is hair, or lock of hair; hence Samson, who was a Nazarite from the womb, had power in his hairs. That in like manner the Divine truth is in its power, in the sense of the letter of the Word, may be seen in the above-mentioned Doctrine concerning the Sacred Scripture (n. 37–49). Therefore, also, the high priest and his sons were severely prohibited from shaving the head. For this reason, forty-two boys were torn in pieces by two bears, because they called Elisha “bald.”"

They who separate them, appear also in the spiritual world, at a distance, like bears, whence it is evident why it was so done with the boys. Therefore also to induce baldness was the greatest disgrace, and a mark of extreme mourning. [3] For which reason, when the Israelitish nation had perverted all the sense of the letter of the Word, this lamentation was made over them: Her Nazarites were whiter than snow, bright white above milk; their form was darkened more than blackness, they are not known in the streets (Lam. 4:7–8). Every head was made bald, and every shoulder was plucked of its hair (Ezek. 29:18). Shame shall be upon all faces, and baldness upon all heads (Ezek. 7:18). In like manner, Isa. 15:2; Jer. 48:37; Amos 8:10. Because the sons of Israel dispersed by falsities all the sense of the letter of the Word, therefore the prophet Ezekiel was commanded to represent it by this, that: He should shave the head with a razor, and burn with fire a third part of the hairs, a third part he should smite with a sword, and scatter a third part in the wind, and bind up some in his skirts, and afterwards cast them also into the fire (Ezek. 5:1–4 seq.). [4] Therefore, also, it is said in Micah: Induce baldness and poll thee for sons of thy delights, enlarge thy baldness as the eagle; for they are removed from thee (Micah 1:16).

It is said “as wool,” and “as snow,” because “wool” signifies good in ultimates, and “snow,” truth in ultimates; as also in Isaiah (1:18); for “wool” is from sheep, by which is signified the good of charity, and “snow” is from water, by which are signified the truths of faith. 48.

The natural man, which is also the external man, is purified, when he shuns the evils which the spiritual or internal man sees to be evils and that they ought to be shunned.

[8] The Lord’s Divine natural is also signified by: The brazen serpent, which was set up by the command of Moses in the wilderness; by looking upon which, all who had been bitten by serpents were healed (Num. 21:6, 8–9). This signified the Lord’s Divine natural, and that they are saved who look to it, the Lord himself teaches in John: As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the son of man be lifted up, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life (John 3:14–15). The reason why the serpent was made of brass, is because brass, as also fine brass signifies the natural as to good, see below (n. 775). 50. And his voice as the voice of many waters signifies the Divine truth natural. That a “voice” when from the Lord signifies the Divine truth, may be seen above (n. 37); that “waters” signify truths, and, specifically, natural truths, which are knowledges from the Word, is evident from many passages in the Word; of which only the following are adduced: The earth is full of the knowledge of Jehovah, as the waters cover the sea (Isa. 11:9). Therefore, with joy shall ye draw waters out of the fountains of salvation (Isa. 12:3). He that walketh righteously and speaketh uprightness bread shall be given him, and water shall be sure (Isa. 33:15–16)."

Jesus said, If anyone thirst, let him come unto me, and drink. He that believeth on me, as the Scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow streams of living water (John 7:37–38). I will give unto him that thirsteth of the fountain of the water of life freely (Rev. 21:6). He showed me a river of water of life, going out of the throne of God, and of the lamb (Rev. 22:1).

To be born “of water” signifies to be born by truths; and “of the spirit” signifies by a life according to them.

Around the angels, when they are below the heavens, there appear, as it were, little stars in great abundance; and in like manner, around spirits, who, when they lived in the world, had acquired to themselves knowledges of good and truth, or truths of life and doctrine from the Word. These stars appear fixed with those who are in genuine truths from the Word; but wandering with those who are in falsified truths. Concerning those little stars, as also concerning the stars which appear there in the firmament, I could relate wonderful things, but it does not belong to this work: hence it is evident that by “stars” are signified the knowledges of good and truth from the Word. “The son of man had them in his right hand” signifies that they are from the Lord alone through the Word.

Mention is very often made in the Word of “sword,” “saber,” and “long sword,” and by them nothing else is signified but truth fighting against falsities and destroying them; and also in the opposite sense, the falsity fighting against truths; for by “wars” in the Word, are signified spiritual wars, which are wars of truth against falsity, and of falsity against truth; wherefore, by “the arms of war,” such things are signified as are made use of in spiritual wars. That the dispersion of falsities by the Lord is here meant by sword [romphoea] is evident, because it was seen “to go out of his mouth”; and to go out of the mouth of the Lord, is to go out of the Word, for this the Lord spoke with his mouth; and as the Word is understood by doctrine, thence this is also signified. It is called “a sharp two-edged sword,” because it penetrates the heart and soul.

By “sword” is here also meant the devastation of truth in the church. Jehovah will plead by his sword with all flesh, and the pierced of Jehovah shall be multiplied (Isa. 66:16). They are called “the pierced of Jehovah” here, and in other parts of the Word, who perish by falsities. The wasters are come upon all the hills in the wilderness; the sword of Jehovah is devouring from the end of the earth, even to the end of the earth (Jer. 12:12).

And he said unto them, It is enough (Luke 22:36, 38). All they that take the sword, shall perish with the sword (Matt. 26:51–52). Jesus says concerning the consummation of the age: They shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away captive into all nations, and at length Jerusalem shall be trodden down (Luke 21:24). “The consummation of the age” is the last time of the church; “the sword” is falsity destroying truth; the “nations” are evils; “Jerusalem” which shall be trodden down is the church. [5] Hence, then, it is evident, that by “a sharp sword going out of the mouth of the son of man” is signified the dispersion of falsities by the Lord by means of the Word. The same is signified in the following passages in Revelation: And there was given unto him who sat upon the red horse a great sword (Rev. 6:4).

This is said of the Jewish church, which was “to breathe out its soul,” that is, would perish; “the sun shall set” signifies that there will be no longer any love and charity. [6] It is said in Joshua that: The sun stood still in Gibeon, and the moon in the valley of Ajalon (Josh. 10:12–13). This appears as if it was historical, but it is prophetic, being quoted from the book of Jasher, which was a prophetic book; for it is said: Is not this written in the book of Jasher? (Josh. 13). The same book is also mentioned as prophetic by David (2 Sam. 1:17, 18); something similar is also said in Habakkuk: The mountains were moved, the sun and moon stood in their seat (Hab. 3:10–11).

To adore the sun of the world is also to acknowledge nature as the creator, and one’s own prudence to be effective of all things, which involves the denial of God, and the denial of the Divine providence. 54. Verse 17. And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead signifies that from such presence of the Lord there was a defect or deprivation of his own life. A man’s own life cannot sustain the presence of the Lord, such as the Lord is in himself, yea, such as he is in the inmosts of his Word; for his Divine love is altogether like the sun, which no one can bear as it is in itself, without being consumed. This is what is meant by saying that: No one can see God and live (Exod. 33:29; Judges 13:22). This being the case, therefore the Lord appears to the angels in heaven as a sun, at a distance from them, as the sun of this world is from men; the reason is, because the Lord in himself is in that sun. But yet the Lord so moderates and tempers his Divine that man can sustain his presence. This is effected by veilings. It was so done when he revealed himself to many in the Word. Yea, by veilings he is present with everyone who worships him; as he himself says in John: He that doeth my commandments, with him I will make my abode (John 14:21, 23). That he will be in them, and they in him (John 15:4–5). Hence it is evident why John, when he saw the Lord in such glory, fell at his feet as dead; and also, why the three disciples, when they saw the Lord in glory, were heavy with sleep, and a cloud covered them (Luke 9:32, 34). 55.

The reason is that the life of the mind, and thence of the body, puts itself forth into the arms, and through them into the hands. On this account: The Lord touched with his hands those whom he restored to life and healed (Mark 1:31, 41; 7:32–33; 8:22–26; 10:13, 16; Luke 5:12–13; 7:14; 18:15; 22:51). After his disciples saw Jesus transfigured, and they fell on the face (Matt. 17:6–7). The origin of this is that the presence of the Lord with man is adjunction, and thus conjunction by contiguity; and this is near and fuller in proportion as man loves the Lord, that is, does his commandments. From these few things it may appear that by “laying his right hand on him” is signified inspiring him with his life. 56. Saying unto me, Fear not signifies resuscitation, and then adoration from the deepest humiliation. That it is resuscitation to life, is a consequence of what went before (n. 55); and that it is adoration from the deepest humiliation is evident, for he fell at the Lord’s feet. And as a holy fear seized him, the Lord said, on his being resuscitated, “Fear not.” Holy fear, which sometimes is joined with a sacred tremor of the interiors of the mind, and sometimes with horripilation, supervenes, when life enters from the Lord in place of one’s own life. One’s own life is to look from one’s self to the Lord, but life from the Lord is to look from the Lord to the Lord and yet as if from himself. When man is in this latter life, he sees that he himself is not anything, but the Lord only. Daniel also was in this holy fear, when: He saw the man clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with gold of Uphaz, his body like the beryl, his face like lightning, his eyes like torches of fire, his arms and feet as the splendor of polished brass, upon seeing whom Daniel also became as dead, and a hand touched him, and it was said, Fear not, Daniel (Dan. 10:5–12)."

The Lord also said unto the women who saw him at the sepulcher, Fear not (Matt. 28:10). Likewise the angel, whose face appeared like lightning, and his garment as snow, said unto those women, Fear not ye (Matt. 28:3–5). The angel said to Zechariah also, Fear not (Luke 1:12–13). In like manner the angel said to Mary, Fear not (Luke 1:30). The angels said to the shepherds also, when the glory of the Lord shone round about them, Fear not (Luke 2:9–10). A similar holy fear seized Simon, by reason of the draught of fishes; therefore he said: Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord; but Jesus said unto him, Fear not (Luke 5:8–10; besides other places).

The Lord as to his Divine human also is life, because the Father and he are one; therefore he says: As the Father hath life in himself, so hath he given to the son to have life in himself (John 5:26). Jesus said, I am the resurrection and the life (John 11:25). Jesus said, I am the way, the truth, and the life (John 14:6). In the beginning was the Word, and God was the Word; in him was life; and the Word became flesh (John 1:1–4, 14). Because the Lord is the only life, it follows that from him alone life is derived; therefore he says: Because I live, ye shall live also (John 14:19). 59. And was dead signifies that he was neglected and his Divine human not acknowledged. By “his becoming dead” is not meant that he was crucified, and so died, but that he was neglected in the church, and his Divine human not acknowledged, for so he is dead with men. His Divine from eternity is indeed acknowledged, but this is Jehovah himself; but his human is not acknowledged to be Divine, although the Divine and the human in him are like soul and body, and therefore are not two but one, yea, one person, according to the doctrine received throughout the whole Christian world, which has its name from Athanasius. When, therefore, the Divine in him is separated from the human, by saying that his human is not Divine, but like the human of another man, in this case he is dead with men. But concerning this separation and thus making dead the Lord, more may be seen in Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Lord; and in Angelic Wisdom concerning Divine Providence (n. 262–263)."

Now as, “Who am living” signifies that he alone is life, and from him alone life is (as above, n. 58), it follows that “Behold I am alive for ages of ages” signifies that he alone is life to eternity, and consequently that eternal life is from him alone; for eternal life is in him, and consequently from him. “Ages of ages” signifies eternity. That eternal life is from the Lord alone is plain from the following passages: Jesus said, Whosoever believeth in me shall not perish, but shall have eternal life (John 3:16). Everyone that believeth in the son hath eternal life, but he who believeth not in the son, shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him (John 3:36; 6:40, 47–48). Verily, I say unto you, he that believeth in me hath eternal life (John 6:47). I am the resurrection and the life; he that believeth in me, though he die, shall live; and whosoever believeth in me, shall not die to eternity (John 11:25–26; and in other places). Hence, then, the Lord is called, “he that liveth for ages of ages”; as also in the following passages: Rev. 4:9–10; 5:14; 10:6; Dan. 4:34. 61. Amen signifies the Divine confirmation that it is the truth. That “amen” is the truth, which is the Lord, may be seen above (n. 23). 62. And I have the keys of hell and death signifies that he alone can save. By “keys” is signified the power of opening and shutting; here the power of opening hell, that man may be brought forth, and of shutting, lest, when he is brought forth, he should enter again. For man is born in evils of all kinds, thus in hell, for evils are hell; he is brought out of it by the Lord, to whom belongs the power of opening it. That by “having the keys of hell and death” is not meant the power of casting into hell, but the power of saving, is because it immediately follows after these words: Behold, I am alive for ages of ages;"

The power of the Lord is not only over heaven, but also over hell; for hell is kept in order and connection by oppositions against heaven; for which reason, he who rules the one must necessarily rule the other; otherwise man could not be saved; to be saved is to be brought out of hell. 63. Verse 19. Write the things which thou hath seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter signifies that all the things now revealed are for the use of posterity; as may appear without explanation. 64. Verse 20. The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden lampstands signifies arcana in visions concerning the new heaven and the new church.

That church is the new heaven, concerning which something is said in the preface. The reason why the church in the heavens, or the new heaven, is meant by “the seven stars” is because it is said that “the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches,” and by “angel” is signified a heavenly society. In the spiritual world there appears an expanse full of stars, as in the natural world, and this appearance is from the angelic societies in heaven. Each society there shines like a star before those who are below; hence they there know in what situation the angelic societies are.

And the seven lampstands which thou sawest are the seven churches signifies the new church upon earth, which is the New Jerusalem descending from the Lord out of the new heaven. That “the lampstands” are the church, may be seen above (n. 43); and because “seven” signify all (n. 10), by “the seven lampstands” are not meant seven churches, but the church in the aggregate, which in itself is one, but various according to reception. Those varieties may be compared to the various diadems in the crown of a king; and they may also be compared to the various members and organs in a perfect body, which yet make one. The perfection of every form exists from various things being suitably arranged in their order. Hence it is that the whole new church is described as to its varieties by “the seven churches” in what follows. 67. The faith of the new heaven and the new church, in one universal idea, is this: that the Lord from eternity, who is Jehovah, came into the world that he might subjugate the hells, and glorify his human; and that without this no mortal could be saved; and that they are saved who believe in him. [2] It is said, in a universal idea, because this is the universal of faith, and the universal of faith is what must be in each and every thing of it. It is a universal of faith, that God is one in person and in essence, in whom there is a trinity, and that the Lord is that God. It is a universal of faith, that no mortal could be saved unless the Lord came into the world. It is a universal of faith, that he came into the world that he might remove hell from man; and that he did remove it by combats against it and by victories over it; thus he subjugated it, and reduced it into order, and under obedience to himself. It is also a universal of faith, that he came into the world to glorify the human, which he assumed in the world, that is, might unite it with the Divine from which it was; thus having subjugated hell, he keeps it in order and under obedience to himself to eternity.

This and the following chapter treat of the seven churches, by which are described all those in the Christian church who have any religion, and out of whom the new church, which is the new Jerusalem, can be formed; and this is formed of those who approach the Lord alone, and at the same time perform repentance from evil works. The rest, who do not approach the Lord alone, from the confirmed denial of the divinity of his human, and who do not perform repentance from evil works, are indeed in the church, but have nothing of the church in them. 70. Since the Lord alone is acknowledged as the God of heaven and earth by those who are of his new church in the heavens, and by those who will be of his new church upon earth; therefore, in the first chapter of Revelation the Lord alone is treated of; and in the two following chapters, it is he alone who speaks to the churches, and he alone who will give the happy things of eternal life. That it is he alone who speaks to the churches is evident from these passages: Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write, These things saith he who holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden lampstands (Rev. 2:1). Unto the angel of the church of Smyrna write, These things saith the first and the last (Rev. 2:8).

Unto the church in Pergamos, To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new5 name written, which no man knoweth but he that receiveth it (Rev. 2:17). Unto the church in Thyatira, To him will I give power over the nations, and I will give him the morning star (Rev. 2:26, 28). Unto the church in Philadelphia, Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God; and I will write upon him the name of my God, the name of the new Jerusalem, and my new name (Rev. 3:12). Unto the church in Laodicea, To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne (Rev. 3:21)."

Hence it is that this church is called the lamb’s wife (Rev. 19:7, 9; 21:9–10). 72. That the new church, which is the new Jerusalem, is formed of those who repent of evil works is also manifest from the Lord’s words to the churches: To Ephesus; I know thy works; I have against thee, that thou hast left thy first charity. Repent, and do the former works; or else I will remove thy lampstand out of its place, except thou repent (Rev. 2:2, 4–5). To the church in Pergamos; I know thy works, repent (Rev. 2:13, 16).

They may also be compared with the various diadems in a king’s crown; and hence it is that the whole new church with its varieties is described, in what now follows, by “the seven churches.” That by the church of Ephesus are meant those in the church who primarily regard the truths of doctrine and not the goods of life is clear from the things written to that church, when understood in"

If the mind is charity, the work becomes charity; but if the mind is not charity, the work does not become charity; still, however, they may both appear alike in externals. Works appear to men in external form, but to angels in internal form; and to the Lord their quality is apparent from inmost to outmosts. Works in their external form appear like the outside of fruits, but works in their internal form appear like the inside of fruits, where there are innumerable edible parts, and in the midst seeds, in which there are also things innumerable, which are too minute for the keenest eye to discern,"

And because he is worshiped in the church according to doctrine, by his “name” is meant the all of doctrine, and, in the universal sense, the all of religion. The reason why these things are meant by “the name” of Jehovah is because in heaven no other names are given but what involve the quality of anyone, and the quality of God is all that by which he is worshiped. He who does not know this signification of “name” in the Word, can only understand name; and in this alone there is nothing of worship and religion.

The reason is, that the goods of life open the interiors of the mind, and these being opened, truths appear in their own light, whence they are not only understood, but also loved. It is otherwise when doctrinals are regarded primarily or in the first place. Truths may indeed then be known, but they are not seen interiorly and loved from spiritual affection; but this may be seen illustrated above (n. 17). Every church in its beginning, regards the goods of life in the first place, and the truths of doctrine in the second; but as the church declines, it begins to regard the truths of doctrine in the first place, and the goods of life in the second; and at length in the end it regards faith alone, and then it"

Verse 5. Remember therefore whence thou hast fallen; that this signifies remembrance of their error is plain from what has just been said. 84. And repent, and do the first works signifies that they ought to invert the state of their life. Every man regards the truths of doctrine in the first place, yet so long as he does this, he is like unripe fruit; but he who is regenerated, after he has imbibed truths, regards the goods of life in the first place, and in proportion as he does so, he grows ripe like fruit; and in proportion as he grows ripe, and as far as he grows ripe, so far the seed in him becomes prolific. These two states have been seen by me, among men who had become spirits. In the first state, they appeared turned to the valleys which are above hell; and in the second, to the paradises which are in heaven. This turning of the state of life is what is here meant.

This follows from what was said above (n. 82), namely, that if truths of doctrine are regarded primarily, or in the first place, they may indeed be known, but not seen interiorly, and loved from spiritual affection, therefore they successively perish; for to see truths from their own light is to see them from man’s interior mind, which is called the spiritual mind, and this mind is opened by charity; and when it is opened, light"

Verse 6. But this thou hast, that thou hatest the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate signifies that they know this from their truths, and thence are not willing that works should be meritorious, because this is contrary to the merit and justice of the Lord. That “the works of the Nicolaitans” are meritorious works, it has been given to know from revelation. It is said, that they hate those works, because the church from the truths of its doctrine knows this, and thence does not will it; therefore it is said, “this thou hast.” Yet all those make works meritorious who put the truths of faith in the first place, and the goods of charity in the second; but not those who put the goods of charity in the first place. The reason is, that genuine charity does not wish to merit, for it loves to do good, for it is in it and acts from it; and from good it looks to the Lord; and from truths it knows that all good is from him; it therefore has an aversion to merit. Now because they who regard the truths of faith in the first place, cannot do any other works than such as are meritorious, and yet know, from their truths, that these are to be hated, therefore this follows after it was said, that if they do not hold charity in the first place, they do works which ought to be held in aversion. It is said that it is contrary to the merit and justice of the Lord; for they who place merit in works, ascribe justice to themselves, for they say justice is on their side because they have merited, when yet it is the greatest injustice, because the Lord alone has merit, and alone does good in them. That the Lord alone is justice is taught in Jeremiah: Behold, the days shall come, when I will raise up a just branch unto David, and this is his name which they shall call him, Jehovah our justice (Jer. 23:5–6; 33:15–16)."

By “hearing” is signified both to perceive and to obey; because one attends that he may perceive and obey; that both these are signified by “hearing” is evident from common discourse, in which one speaks of hearing and of hearkening to anyone; the latter signifying to obey, and the former to perceive. That “hearing” has these two significations is from correspondence; for those are in the province of the ears in heaven, who are in perception and at the same time in obedience. As both these things are signified by “hearing” therefore the Lord so often said: He that hath an ear to hear let him hear (Matt. 11:15; 13:43; Mark 4:9, 23; 7:16; Luke 8:8; 14:35).

And affliction and poverty signifies that they are in falsities and thence not in goods. “To know their affliction” signifies to see that they are in falsities, and “to know their poverty” signifies to see that they are not in goods, for in the Word, “affliction” is predicated of falsities (as above, n. 33); and “poverty” of the lack of goods; spiritual poverty is nothing else. “The poor and needy” are often mentioned in the Word, and in the spiritual sense by “poor” is meant one who is not in truths, and by “needy” one who is not in goods. These words are also added, “yet thou art rich” but in a parenthesis, and this because in some codices they are omitted. 96.

By “Jews” are meant they who are in the good of love, because in the Word by “Judah” in the supreme sense is meant the Lord as to the Divine good of Divine love, and by “Israel” the Lord as to the Divine truth of Divine wisdom; hence by “Jews” are signified they who are in the good of love from the Lord, and by “Israel” they who are in Divine truths from the Lord. That these are meant by “Jews” may appear from many passages, which will be adduced below (n. 350); something may also be seen on this subject in Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning Sacred Scripture (n. 51).6 In the abstract sense the goods of love are meant by “Jews” because the spiritual sense is abstracted from persons, as may be seen above (n. 78, 79). He who does not know that by “Jews” in the Word, are meant those who are of the Lord’s celestial church, who are they that are in love to him, may fall into many mistakes when reading the Word in the prophets; but see below (n. 350). 97. But are the synagogue of satan signifies because they are in falsities as to doctrine. It is called “synagogue” because the Jews are mentioned, and as they taught in synagogues, by “synagogue” is signified doctrine; and because by “satan” is meant the hell of those who are in falsities, therefore it is called “the synagogue of satan.” Hell is called “the devil” and “satan” and by the hell which is called “the devil” are meant such there as are in evils, properly who are in the love of self; and by the hell which is called “satan” are meant such there as are in falsities, properly who are in the pride of their own intelligence. The hells are called the “devil” and “satan” because all who are in them are called devils and satans. Hence then it may appear, that by their being “the synagogue of satan” is signified that as to doctrine they are in falsities."

All the good of worship is formed by truths, and all truth is formed from good, therefore good without truth is not good, neither is truth, without good, truth; they appear indeed in external form to be so, but still they are not. The conjunction of good and truth is called the heavenly marriage; from this is the church with man, and it is heaven with him. If therefore there are falsities instead of truths with man, then he does the good of falsity, which is not good, for it is either pharisaical or meritorious, or innate natural good. [3] But examples will illustrate this. He who is in this falsity, that he believes he does good from himself, because he has the faculty of doing good; his good is not good, because he himself is in it, and not the Lord. He who is in this falsity, that he can do good which is in itself good, without a knowledge of what evil is in himself, thus without repentance, although he appears to do good, yet he does not do good, because without repentance he is in evil. He who is in this falsity, that good purifies him from evils, and does not know anything of the evils in which he is, he does no other good than spurious good, which is inwardly contaminated by his evils. He who is in this falsity, that there are many gods, and confirms himself in this, the good which he does is divided good, and divided good is not good. He who is in this falsity, that he believes the Divine in the Lord’s human is not like the soul in the body, cannot do good from him, and good not from the Lord is not good, for it is contrary to these words of the Lord: Except one abide in me and I in him, he cannot bring forth any fruit; for without me ye cannot do anything. Except one abide in me, he is cast forth as a dried branch, and is cast into the fire and burned (John 15:4–6; and in many other passages).

It is believed, that in the good which a man does, there is not anything from truths or falsities, when yet the quality of good is from no other source, for they cohere together like love and wisdom, and also like love and foolishness; it is the love of the wise which does good, but the love of the foolish does what is like good in externals, but totally unlike it in internals; therefore the good of the wise is like pure gold, but the good of the foolish is like gold covering over dung. 98. Verse 10. Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer signifies, despair not when ye are infested by evils and assaulted by falsities, since with those who are in goods as to life, and in falsities as to doctrine, it cannot be otherwise. This is plain from what now follows. 99. Behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison signifies that their good of life will be infested by evils which are from hell. That this is signified by “being cast into custody” or into “prison” by the devil is, because by “the devil” is meant the hell where they are who are in evils, and thus, abstractly, the evil which is there and from thence (n. 97). To be cast “into custody” or “prison” is to be infested, because they who are infested by evils from hell are as if they were bound in prison, for they cannot think anything but evil, when yet they will good; hence there is combat and interior anxiety, from which they cannot be released, being scarcely otherwise than like persons who are in chains; the reason is, that their good is not good so far as it coheres with falsities, and so far as it coheres with falsities evil is in it; therefore this is what is infested.

[3] In the Word, by “the bound” the like is signified as here by those “cast into prison” as in these places: I will give thee for a covenant of the people, to bring out the bound from the prison, and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house (Isa. 42:6–7; 49:8–9). Jehovah hath sent me to preach liberty to the captives, and to the bound (Isa. 61:1). By the blood of thy covenant I will send forth the bound out of the pit (Zech. 9:11). God bringeth out those which are bound with fetters (Ps. 68:6). Let the groaning of the bound come before thee (Ps. 79:11). To hear the groaning of the bound, to open to the sons of death (Ps. 102:20). Jehovah who looseth the bound (Ps. 146:7). It is plain that by “the bound” in these places are not meant those who are bound in the world, but those who are bound by hell, thus by evils and falsities. Similar is the signification of these words of the Lord: I was in prison, and ye came not unto me (Matt. 25:43). As the Lord “brings out of prison” or delivers from infestation, those who have been in good as to life, though in falsities as to doctrine, he says: “Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer”; also, “Be thou faithful, and I will give thee a crown of life.”"

The reason why this is signified is, because all spiritual temptation is a combat of the devil and the Lord, which shall have possession of man. The devil or hell brings out his falsities, and reproaches and condemns him; but the Lord brings out his truths, and withdraws him from falsities, and delivers him. It is this combat which appears to man as in himself, because it is from evil spirits who are with him, and is called temptation. That spiritual temptation is nothing else, I know from experience, because in my temptations I have seen the infernals who induced them, and have perceived the influx from the Lord, who liberated. 101. And ye shall have affliction ten days signifies that this will endure its full time, that is, as long as they are willing to remain in falsities. “Affliction” here signifies infestation (of which above, n. 33, 95), thus temptation; and “ten days” signify the duration of that state to the full; therefore it follows, “Be thou faithful unto death” by which is signified the reception and acknowledgment of truths, until by their means falsities are removed, and as it were abolished. That “ten days” signify duration of state even to the full is, because “days” signify states, and “ten” what is full: for times in the Word signify states (n. 947), and numbers describe their quality (n. 9). [2] As “ten” signify what is full, they also signify much and many, also each and all, as may appear from these passages which follow: The men who have seen my glory, have tempted me ten times (Num. 14:22). These ten times have ye treated me with ignominy (Job 19:3). Daniel was found ten times wiser than the astrologers (Dan. 1:20). Ten women shall bake bread in one oven (Lev. 26:26).

And because “ten” signifies all and all things, therefore the Lord compared the kingdom of the heavens to “ten virgins” (Matt. 25:1). Likewise in the parable he said of the nobleman, that he gave his servants “ten pounds” to trade with (Luke 19:12–27). Many are also signified by: The ten horns of the beast which came up out of the sea (Dan. 7:7); And by the ten horns and the ten diadems upon the horns of the beast coming up out of the sea (Rev. 13:1); Also by the ten horns of the dragon (Rev. 12:3); And by the ten horns of the scarlet-colored beast, upon which the woman sat (Rev. 17:3, 7, 12). [3] By “ten horns” is signified much power. From the signification of the number “ten” as being what is full, much, and all, it may be seen why it was ordained, that: A tenth part of all the produce of the earth was given to Jehovah, and by Jehovah to Aaron and the Levites (Num. 18:24, 28; Deut. 14:22); also, why Abram gave Melchizedek tithes of all (Gen. 14:18, 20); for by this was signified that thus all they had was from Jehovah, and was sanctified (see Mal. 3:10). From these things, it may now appear, that by having “affliction ten days” is signified that temptation will last its full time, that is, so long as they are willing to remain in falsities; for falsities are never taken away from a man against his will, but with it. 102. Be thou faithful unto death signifies reception and acknowledgment of truths, until falsities are removed, and as it were abolished.

It is said, until they are, as it were, abolished, because falsities and evils with man are not abolished, but removed, and when they are removed they appear as if they were abolished, because when evils and falsities are removed, man is kept in goods and truths by the Lord. 103. And I will give thee a crown of life signifies that they will then have eternal life, the reward of victory. Because temptations even unto death are here treated of, it is said that a crown of life will be given them, such as the martyrs had, who were faithful even unto death; and because the martyrs wished for it, therefore after death crowns were given them, by which was signified the reward of victory; they still appear in their crowns in heaven, which it has been granted me to see. 104.

Exactly similar to these are they in the Christian world, who are in works alone and in no truths of doctrine, therefore they cannot be called anything else than gentiles; they know the Lord indeed, but yet do not approach him, and they have the Word, but yet do not search for the truths therein.

This also is signified by “thou dwellest where satan’s throne is.” 111.

That by the “name” of Jehovah, or of the Lord is meant all by which he is worshiped, thus the all of religion, may be seen above (n. 81); here therefore it signifies that they have religion, and, according to religion, worship. By “faith” here is not meant that which exists in the church at this day, but the Divine truth, because faith is of truth and truth is of faith; nothing else is meant by “faith” in heaven, nor by the “faith of God” in the Word; hence it is that faith and truth are expressed in the Hebrew language by one and the same word, and are called amuna .

That by these things are meant they who do works by which worship is defiled and adulterated is evident from the historical parts of the Word concerning Balaam and Balak king of Moab. For Balaam was a hypocrite, and a diviner; for he spoke well of the sons of Israel from Jehovah, when yet he cherished in his heart a desire to destroy them, and also he did destroy them by the counsel he gave Balak; from which it was evident that his works were hypocritical. That he was a diviner we read in Num. 22:7; 24:1; Josh. 13:22. That he spoke in favor of the children of Israel by blessing them (see Num. 23:7–15, 18–24; 24:5–9, 16–19). But that he spoke these things from Jehovah (see Num. 23:5, 12, 16; 24:13). That he cherished in his heart a desire to destroy them, and also did destroy them by the counsel given to Balak (see Num. 31:16). The counsel which he gave is in Num. 25:1, 9, 18. This was the stumbling block which he cast before the sons of Israel, concerning which it is thus written: In Shittim the people began to commit whoredom with the daughters of Moab, and they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods; the people did eat and bowed themselves down to their gods, especially they adjoined themselves unto Baalpeor: therefore there were slain of Israel twenty-four thousand (Num. 25:1–3, 9, 18).

Among those who place the all of the church and of salvation in good works, and not anything in truths of doctrine, who are those who are meant by “the church in Pergamos,” there are some who do hypocritical works and also meritorious works, but still not all; therefore it is said, “Thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam”; as also, “So thou hast, even thou, them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans”; and all works of worship are either good, or meritorious, or hypocritical, therefore the two latter are here spoken of, and good works afterwards in what follows. 116.

For these, because they were in good works, and at the same time in truths of doctrine in the world, are in wisdom above other angels, but in hidden wisdom, for it is written in their life and not so much on their memory; therefore they are of such a nature that they do not talk of the truths of doctrine, but do them, and they do them because they know them, and also see them when others speak them. That the good of love is appropriated to them, and the Lord conjoins himself with those who adjoin truths of doctrine to good works, and thus gives them wisdom in their good, and that this is “giving to eat of the hidden manna” may appear from these words of the Lord: The bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world.

And I will give him a white stone signifies truths favoring and united to good. “A white stone” signifies this because in judgments votes were collected by stones, and by white stones those which were affirmative; that it is affirmative truths which are signified is, because “white” is predicated of truths (n. 167, 379); hence it is, that by a “white stone” are signified truths favoring good; the reason why they are also united to good is, because good invites and unites them to itself; for all good loves truth and conjoins to itself such as agrees with itself, especially the good of celestial love; this so unites truths to itself, that they altogether make a one. Hence it is, that they see truths from good alone. These are meant by “those who have the law written in their hearts” of whom it is said in Jeremiah: I will put my law in the midst of them, and I will write it on their heart; neither shall they teach any longer everyone his neighbor, and everyone his brother, saying, Know ye Jehovah, for all shall know me (Jer. 31:33–34). Such are all who are in the third heaven. They do not speak of truths from any memory, but clearly see them when they hear others speaking of them, especially when they are reading the Word; the reason is, because they are in the very marriage of good and truth. Such do they become in the world, who have approached the Lord alone, and have done good works, because they are according to the truths of the Word; concerning whom something may be seen in Heaven and Hell (n. 25–26, 270–271). 122. And in the stone a new name written signifies that thus they will have good of a quality such as they had not before. That “name” signifies the quality of a thing, may be seen above (n. 81), therefore here the quality of good.

Salt is good, but if the salt has lost its saltiness, wherewith will ye season it? Have salt in yourselves (Mark 9:49–50). Salt here is the desire of truth. 123. Which no one knoweth but he that receiveth it signifies that it does not appear to anyone, because it is inscribed on their life. That truths united to good are not inscribed on their memories, but on their lives, may be seen above (n. 121, 122), and what is inscribed on the life alone, and not on the memory, does not appear to anyone, not even to themselves, except from this, that they perceive whether it is true, and what is true, when they hear and read; for the interiors of their mind are open even unto the Lord; and because the Lord is in them, and he sees all things, therefore he causes them to see as from themselves; but yet from their wisdom they know that they do not see truths from themselves, but from the Lord. Hence, it may appear what is meant by all this, “I will give him to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no one knoweth but he that receiveth it”; the sum of its signification is that they will be angels of the third heaven, if they read the Word, draw therefrom truths of doctrine, and approach the Lord. 124.

The man who is a worshiper of God is sometimes called “a servant” and sometimes a “minister” and he is called “a servant of God” who is in truths, and “a minister of God” who is in goods; the reason is, because truth serves good, and good ministers to truth.

Jesus said: Whosoever will be great, let him be your minister; and whosoever will be first, let him be your servant (Matt. 20:26–27; 23:11–12). “Minister” is here predicated of good, and “servant” of truth. The same is signified by “ministering” and “ministry” in Isaiah 61:6; John 12:26; Luke 12:37; and in other places. Hence it is evident, that by “charity” and “ministry” is signified spiritual affection and its operation; for good is of charity, and truth is of faith. 129. And thy faith and endurance signifies truth, and the study to procure and teach it. That “faith” signifies truth, may be seen above (n. 111); and that in such case endurance signifies study and labor of procuring and teaching it, follows as a consequence.8 130. And the last to be more than the first signifies the increase thereof from the spiritual affection of truth, which is charity. By “the last works more than the first” are meant all things of their charity and faith, for these are the interior things from which are works (n. 73, 76, 94). These things increase when charity is in the first place and faith in the second; for charity is the spiritual affection of doing good, and from it comes the spiritual affection of knowing truth, for good loves truth as food does drink, for it desires to be nourished, and is nourished, by truths; hence it is, that they who are in genuine charity have a continual increase of truth. This then is what is signified by “I know thy works the last more than the first.” 131. Verse 20. But I have a few things against thee signifies that the following things may possibly be a stumblingblock to them. For what now follows relates to faith separated from charity, which may be a stumblingblock to those who are in faith from charity. 132.

That faith separated from charity is meant by “the woman Jezebel” is evident from the things which now follow, when they are unfolded in series by means of the spiritual sense and when they are compared with that faith; for these were the evil deeds of Jezebel the wife of Ahab: That she went and served Baal, and built him an altar in Samaria, and made a grove (1 Kings 16:31–33). That she slew the prophets of Jehovah (1 Kings 18:4, 13). That she wished to kill Elijah (1 Kings 19:1–2). That through deceit by substituting false witnesses, she took away the vineyard from Naboth, and killed him (1 Kings 21:6–7 seq.).

By “slaying the prophets” is signified to destroy the truths of doctrine from the Word. By “wishing to kill Elijah” is signified to wish to do the same to the Word itself. By “taking away the vineyard from Naboth and killing him” is signified the church, for “the vineyard” is the church: by “the dogs” which ate her, are signified lusts. By “casting from the window, sprinkling the blood on the wall, and being trampled by the horses” is signified their destruction, for the particulars signify that also; “window” signifies truth in the light; “blood” falsity; “wall” truth in ultimates, “horse” the understanding"

That by “prophet” in the Word is signified the doctrine of the church, may be seen above (n. 8); therefore the like is signified by “prophetess.” It is known that in the Reformed Christian church faith alone has been accepted as the only means of salvation, and that thence the works of charity have been separated from faith, as not saving; hence it is that the entire doctrine of the salvation of man, which is called theology, at this day is that faith, consequently “the woman Jezebel.” 134. To teach and to seduce my servants to commit whoredom signifies from which it comes to pass that the truths of the Word are falsified. By “to teach and to seduce the servants of the Lord” is meant those who are able and willing to be instructed in truths from the Word; that they are called “servants of the Lord” who are in truths, may be seen above (n. 3, 128); and by “committing whoredom” is signified to adulterate and falsify the Word: that this is signified by “committing whoredom” is, because in every particular of the Word there is the marriage of good and truth, and this marriage is broken when good is separated and taken away from truth. That in every particular of the Word there is the marriage of the Lord and the church, and thence the marriage of good and truth, may be seen in Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning Sacred Scripture (n. 80–90). From this it is, that “to commit whoredom” signifies to adulterate the goods and falsify the truths of the Word; and because this is spiritual whoredom, therefore also they who from their own reason have falsified the Word, after death, when they come into the spiritual world, become whoremongers: and, what has hitherto been concealed from the world, they who have confirmed themselves in faith alone to the exclusion of works of charity, are in"

That they are in the lust of committing so abominable a kind of adultery, has often been perceived in the spiritual world. Remember this, and inquire after death, and you will be confirmed. I have not ventured to reveal this before, because it offends the ears. [2] This adultery is signified by the adultery of Reuben with Bilhah his father’s concubine (Gen. 35:22); for by “Reuben” that faith is signified, for which cause he was cursed by his father Israel, and afterwards his birthright was taken away from him; for his father Israel, prophesying concerning his sons, said of Reuben: Reuben my firstborn, thou art my strength, and the beginning of my power, light as water, thou shalt not excel, because thou wentest up to thy father’s bed; then thou didst profane it: he went up to my couch (Gen. 49:3–4). Therefore his birthright was taken from him. Reuben was the firstborn of Israel; but because he polluted his father’s couch, his birthright was given unto the sons of Joseph (1 Chron. 5:1). That by “Reuben” was represented truth from good, or faith from charity, and afterwards truth separated from good, or faith separated from charity, will be seen in the explanation of chapter 7:5. [3] That by “whoredoms” are signified adulterations of good and falsifications of truth in the Word, may appear from the following passages: When Joram saw Jehu, he said is it peace, Jehu? who said, What peace, so long as the whoredoms of thy mother Jezebel and her incantations are so many? (2 Kings 9:22). By “the whoredoms of Jezebel” are not meant any whoredoms, but her deeds, of which above (n. 132)."

Thus she gave her whoredoms with them; yet she did not abandon her whoredoms in Egypt. The other corrupted her love more than she, and her whoredoms more than the whoredoms of her sister. She added to her whoredoms, she loved the Chaldeans. The sons of Babel came to her to the bed of loves, and they polluted her by their whoredoms (Ezek. 23:2–3, 5, 7–8, 11, 14, 16–17 seq.).

Love a woman beloved of her companion, and an adulteress (Hos. 3:1). As the Jewish church was such, therefore the Jewish nation was called by the Lord “an adulterous generation” (Matt. 12:39; 16:4; Mark 8:38); and in Isaiah, “a seed of adulterers” (57:3); and in Nahum: Woe to the city of bloods, wholly in a lie, a multitude of those pierced, above the multitude of the whoredoms of the harlot, that selleth nations by her whoredoms (Nahum 3:1, 3–4).

And who have not known the depths of satan, as they speak signifies they who do not understand their interiors, which are mere falsities. That by “satan” is meant the hell of those who are in falsities, and abstractly, falsities, may be seen above (n. 97); therefore by its “depths” are signified the interiors of the doctrine separated from charity, which are mere falsities. The depths and interiors of that doctrine are what are delivered in their books and lectures in the universities, and thence in their preachings, the nature of which is pointed out in what is prefixed to the first chapter, where their doctrines are quoted; and particularly in what is there adduced concerning justification by faith and concerning good works; where it may be seen stated that the clergy alone know the arcana of that doctrine, but not the laity, therefore the latter principally are meant by those “who have not known the depths of satan.” 144. I will put upon you none other burden signifies, only that they should beware of them. The reason is, because they confirm their falsities by reasonings from the natural man, and by some things from the Word which they falsify, for by these they can seduce. They are like serpents in the grass which bite those that pass by; or like concealed poisons which kill the unwary."

Nevertheless, that which ye have, hold fast till I come signifies that they should retain the few things which they know from charity and faith, thence from the Word, and live according to them, until the new heaven and the new church are formed, which are the Lord’s coming. For these and no others receive the things which the doctrine of the new Jerusalem teaches concerning the Lord and charity. 146. Verse 26. And he that overcometh and keepeth my works unto the end signifies those who fight against evils and falsities and are reformed, and are actually in charity, and thence faith, and remain in them to the end of life. That “to overcome” is to fight against evils and falsities, may be seen above (n. 88); and that “works” are charity and thence faith in act (n. 76, 141); that “to keep them unto the end” is to be in them, and remain in them to the end of life is evident. 147. To him will I give power over the nations signifies that they shall overcome evils in themselves which are from hell. That by “nations” in the Word are meant those who are in good, and in the opposite sense, those who are in evil, thus, abstractly, goods and evils, may be seen below (n. 483); therefore here by “giving power over the nations” is signified to give them to overcome the evils from hell in themselves. 148. Verse 27. And he shall rule them with a rod of iron signifies by truths from the literal sense of the Word, and at the same time by rational things from natural light. These things are signified by “a rod or staff of iron” because “a rod or staff” in the Word signifies power, and “iron” signifies natural truth, consequently the natural sense of the Word, and at the same time the natural light of man; in these two consists the power of truth. That Divine truth in the natural sense of the Word, which is the sense of its letter is in its power, may be seen in Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Sacred Scripture (n. 37–49); from this cause the literal sense is the basis, container, and support of its spiritual sense (n. 27–36). And that all power is in the ultimates which are called things natural, may be seen in Angelic Wisdom concerning Divine Love and Wisdom"

These, therefore, are “the rod of iron” by which he shall “rule the nations” that is, overcome the evils which are from hell. The like is signified by a “rod of iron” in these passages: Thou shalt break the nations in pieces with a rod of iron, thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel (Ps. 2:9). The woman brought forth a male who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron (Rev. 12:5). Out of the mouth of him that sat upon the white horse went a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations; but he shall rule them with a rod of iron (Rev. 19:15). Jehovah shall smite the wicked with the rod of his mouth (Isa. 11:4). 149. As the vessels of a potter shall they be broken in pieces signifies, as of little or no account. It is said “the vessels of a potter” because by them are signified the things which are of one’s own intelligence, which are all falsities, and in themselves of no account; so in David: Thou shall break the nations in pieces with a rod of iron, thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel (Ps. 2:9). 150. Even as I have received from my Father signifies that they have this from the Lord, who, when he was in the world procured to himself all power over the hells, from his Divine which was in himself. That the Lord, when he was in the world, by admitting temptations into himself, and finally by the last of them, which was the passion of the cross, subjugated the hells and glorified his human, may be seen in Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Lord (n. 29–36); as also above (n. 67); from which it may appear, that “to receive from his Father” is to receive from the Divine which was in him, for he said that “the Father is in him and he in the Father”; that “the Father and he are one”; as also “the Father who is in me”; and more."

That by “stars” are signified the knowledges of good and truth, may be seen above (n. 51); and because by them is intelligence and wisdom, therefore these are signified by “the morning star.” It is called “the morning star” because intelligence and wisdom will be given them by the Lord, when he shall come to establish the new church, which is the new Jerusalem; for he says: That which ye have, hold fast till I come (Rev. 2:25). By which is signified, that they must retain the few truths which they know concerning charity and its faith from the Word, and live according to them, even until the new heaven and the new church are formed, which is the coming of the Lord (n. 145). [2] It is called “the morning star” because by “morning” is signified the coming of the Lord, when there is a new church. That this is meant by “morning” in the Word, appears from the following passages: Until the evening and morning two thousand three hundred; then shall the sanctuary be justified; the vision of the evening and morning is truth (Dan. 8:14, 26). He calleth to me out of Seir, Watchman , watchman, what of the night? The watchman said, The morning cometh, and also the night (Isa. 21:11–12). By “the evening” and “the night” is signified the last time of the old church, and by “the morning” the first time of the new church. The end is come, the morning is come upon thee, O thou inhabitant of the earth; behold the day it is come, the morning hath gone forth (Ezek. 7:6–7, 10). Jehovah in the morning, in the morning he will give his judgment in light, he faileth not (Zeph. 3:5)."

[3] By “morning” in these passages is meant the Lord’s coming, when he came into the world and established a new church; in like manner now. And because the Lord alone gives those who will be of his new church intelligence and wisdom; and all things which the Lord gives are himself because they are of himself, therefore the Lord says that he himself is “the morning star”: I am the root and offspring of David, the bright and morning star (Rev. 22:16).

To the above I will add something memorable, concerning the lot of those after death, who have confirmed themselves in faith alone even to justification, both in doctrine and life. [1] 1. When they are dead and revive as to the spirit, which generally takes place on the third day after the heart has ceased to beat, they appear to themselves in a body like that which they had before in the world, even so that they know no otherwise than that they are living in the former world; yet they are not in a material"

All the societies there, which are innumerable, are wonderfully arranged according to natural affections, good and evil. The societies arranged according to good natural affections communicate with heaven, and the societies arranged according to evil affections communicate with hell. [3] 3. The novitiate spirit, or the spiritual man, is conducted and introduced to various societies, both good and evil, and is explored whether he is affected by truths, and how; and whether he is affected by falsities, and how.

But this takes place with those who in the world have lived a life of charity, and thus also a life of faith, which consists in believing in the Lord, and shunning evils as sins. [5] 5. But they who have confirmed themselves in doctrine and life even to justification by faith alone, by reason of their not being affected by truths, but by falsities, and because they have rejected the goods of charity, which are good works, from the means of salvation, are withdrawn from good societies, and introduced into evil societies, and also into various ones, until they come into the society corresponding to the concupiscences of their love; for he who loves falsities cannot but love evils.

I have seen such transferred from one society to another, and some administration given them in each, but after a short time as often are dismissed. [7] 7. After frequent dismissals, some out of weariness will not, and others from the fear of losing reputation dare not, seek for offices anymore, therefore they withdraw, and sit sad, and then they are led away into a desert, where there are cottages, into which they enter, and work of some kind is given them to do, and as they do it, they receive food, and if they do not do it, they are hungry and receive none, wherefore necessity compels. Food there is similar to the food in our world, but it is from a spiritual origin, and is given from heaven by the Lord to all according to the uses they perform; to the idle, nothing is given, because they are useless. [8] 8. After some time they loathe work, and then they go out of the cottages; and if they have been priests, they desire to build; and there appear then immediately heaps of hewn stones, bricks, rafters, and boards, also heaps of reeds and bulrushes, clay, lime, and bitumen, which when they see, the lust of building is kindled, and they begin to construct a house, taking now a stone, and then wood, now a reed, and then clay, and placing them one upon another without order; but in their own sight in order. But what they build by day falls down by night; and the next day they collect from the rubbish, and build again, and this they continue to do, until they are tired of building. This is done, because they have collected together falsities to confirm salvation by faith alone, and such falsities do not build up the church in any other manner. [9] 9.

And then they rise up gladly, and go with them to their houses, and there each has his work given him, and food for his work. But because all who have confirmed themselves in falsities of faith are unable to do works of good use, but only works of evil use, neither do they do these faithfully, but only so as to appear for the sake of honor or gain; therefore they leave their works, and only love to converse, talk, walk about, and sleep. And then, because they cannot any longer be induced by their masters to work, they are cast out as useless. [10] 10. When they are cast out, their eyes are opened, and they see a way leading to a certain cavern. When they are come thither, the door is opened, and they enter, and inquire whether there is any food there; and when they receive for answer that there is, they ask leave to remain, and are told that they may, and are introduced and the door shut after them. And then the overseer of that cavern comes and says to them, Ye cannot go out hence any more; behold your companions, they all labor, and as they labor food is given them from heaven. I tell you this that ye may know.

He is told also, that everyone after his task is done is permitted to walk about, to converse, and afterwards to sleep. And he is led into an interior part of the cavern, where there are harlots, from among whom each is permitted to take one for his woman, and promiscuous whoredom is forbidden under punishment.

Verse 22. “He that hath an ear, let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches” signifies here, as before (n. 223). THE EXPLANATION 154. Verse 1. And unto the angel of the church in Sardis write signifies to those and concerning those, who are in dead worship, or in worship which is without the goods of charity and without the truths of faith. That they who are in such worship are meant by “the church in Sardis,” is evident from what is written to it when understood in the spiritual sense. By dead worship is meant worship alone, which is to frequent temples, to hear preachings, to go to the holy supper, to read the Word and books of piety, to talk about God, of heaven and hell, of the life after death, especially of piety, to pray morning and evening, and yet they do not desire to know the truths of faith, nor do they will to do the goods of charity, believing that they have salvation by means of worship alone; when yet worship without truths, and without a life according to them, is only the external sign of charity and faith, within which there may lie concealed all kinds of evils and falsities, if charity and faith are not in them; for of these genuine worship consists; or else the worship is like the skin or surface of any kind of fruit, in which there lies concealed putrid and worm-eaten pulp, which fruit is dead. That such worship reigns in the church at this day is known. 155. These things saith he that hath the seven spirits of God, and the seven stars signifies the Lord, from whom are all truths, and all the knowledges of good and truth. That by “the seven spirits of God” is meant the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord, or the Divine verity, may be seen above (n. 14); and that by “the seven stars” are meant all the knowledges of good and truth from the Word (n."

These things are now said by the Lord, because the subject treated of is concerning dead worship and concerning living worship, and worship lives from truths, and from a life according to them. 156. I know thy works signifies that the Lord sees all their interiors and exteriors at once, as above (n. 76). 157. That thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead signifies that it may be seen and believed by themselves and by others, that they are spiritually alive, when yet they are spiritually dead. By “having a name,” is signified to seem and to be believed to be such; here that they are alive, when yet they are dead; for spiritual life, which is properly life, does not consist in worship alone, but is inwardly in worship, and inwardly there ought to be Divine truths from the Word, and when man lives according to them, there is life in the worship; the reason is because the external derives its quality from internals, and the internals of worship are truths of life. These are they who are meant by these words of the Lord: Then shall ye begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, open unto us; but he shall answer and say, I know you not whence you are. And ye shall begin to say, We have eaten before thee and drunk before thee and thou hast taught in our streets; but I will say to you, I know you not whence ye are; depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity (Luke 13:25–27). [2] I have also been permitted to hear many in the spiritual world say, that they have often gone to the holy communion, and thus have eaten and drunk what is holy, and have as often been absolved from their sins; that every Sabbath day they have hearkened to their teachers; and have devoutly prayed at home morning and evening, besides other things. But when the interiors of their worship were laid open, they appeared full of iniquities and infernal things, therefore they were rejected. And when they asked the reason of it, they had for answer, that they were not at all solicitous about Divine truths. And yet a life not according to Divine truths is not life such as they have who are in heaven; and they who are not in the life of heaven, cannot bear the light of heaven, which is the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord as the sun there; still less"

But although they heard and also understood these things, yet when they were let into themselves and their own worship, they said, “What need is there of truths, and what are truths?” But as they were no longer able to receive truths, they were left to their concupiscences, which were within their worship, and these at length rejected from them all their worship of God. For the interiors accommodate the exteriors to themselves, and reject the things which do not agree with themselves; for with all after death the exteriors are rendered analogous to the interiors. 158. Verse 2. Be watchful signifies that they should be in truths and in a life according to them. By “watching,” in the Word, nothing else is signified; for he who learns truths and lives according to them is like one who is awakened out of sleep and becomes watchful. But he who is not in truths, but only in worship, is like one who sleeps and dreams. Natural life, considered in itself, or without spiritual life, is nothing else but sleep; but natural life, in which there is spiritual life, is watchfulness; and this cannot be acquired otherwise than by truths, which are in their own light and in their own day, when man is in the life according to them. Such is signified by “watching” in the following passages: Watch, for ye know not in what hour the Lord will come (Matt. 24:42). Happy are those servants whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching: Be ye therefore ready, for the Son of man will come at an hour when ye think not (Luke 12:37, 40). Watch ye, for ye know not when the lord of the house shall come; lest coming suddenly, he find you sleeping; what I say unto you, I say unto all, Watch (Mark 13:35–37). While the bridegroom tarried, the virgins slumbered and slept, and the five foolish came and said, Lord, open to us; but the lord shall answer, I know you not; watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man will come (Matt. 25:1–13).

But that the state of a man who is not in truths is called “slumbering” and “sleeping,” may be seen (Jeremiah 51:39, 57; Psalm 13:3; Psalm 76:6; Luke 8:23; and in other places). 159. And strengthen the remaining things which are about to die signifies that the things which pertain to their worship may receive life, and not be extinguished. How these things are to be understood shall be stated. Dead worship is altogether similar to living worship in its external form, because they who are in truths do the same things, for they hear preachings, go to the holy supper, pray on their knees morning and evening, besides other things which are common and customary in worship; therefore they who are in dead worship, have need of nothing more than to learn truths and live according to them; so that “the remaining things which are ready to die” may be confirmed. 160. For I have not found thy works full before God signifies that the interiors of their worship are not conjoined with the Lord. That by “works” are meant the interiors and exteriors, and that by “I know thy works,” is signified that the Lord sees all the interiors and exteriors of man at once, may be seen above (n. 76); which are called “full before God,” when they are conjoined with the Lord. It must be known, that dead worship or worship which is only external, causes the Lord’s presence, but not conjunction; but external worship, in which the interiors live, causes both presence and conjunction. For the conjunction of the Lord is with the things with man which are from the Lord, which are truths from good, and unless these are in worship, the works are not full before God, but are empty. A man is said to be “empty” in the Word, in whom there are nothing but falsities and evils (as in Matthew 12:44, and in other places). Hence a man is said to be “full,” in whom there are truths and goods."

These are the things that are to be understood by these words; as also, that everyone may know from the Word, from the doctrines of the church from the Word, and from preachings, that truths ought to be learned, and that by truths man has faith, charity, and all things of the church. [2] That this is the case is abundantly shown in Arcana Coelestia; published at London; that by truths comes faith (n. 4353, 4977, 7178, 10,367).

That by truths there is purification from evils and falsities (n. 2799, 5954, 7044, 7918, 10,229, 10,237). That by truths the church exists (n. 1798, 1799, 3963, 4468, 4672). That by truths heaven exists (n. 6690, 9832, 9931, 10,303). That by truths comes the innocence of wisdom (n. 3183, 3494, 6013). That by truths there is conscience (n. 1077, 2053, 9113).

[3] But who thinks this? Is it not at this day a matter of indifference what truths a man knows, provided he is in worship?

Otherwise of what use would the Word be, and doctrine thence, or what would be the use of sabbaths and preachings, as well as of books of instruction, yea to what purpose would the church and religion be? That all worship in its beginning is natural, and afterwards by truths from the Word, and a life according to them, becomes spiritual, is known; for man is born natural, but is educated in order that he may become civil and moral, and afterwards spiritual, for thus he is born again. These things therefore are signified by “Remember how thou hast received and heard.” 162. And observe and repent signifies that they should attend to these things and vivify their dead worship. That “to observe” is to attend to those things which are meant by “Remember how thou hast received and heard,” is evident; and that “to repent” is to vivify dead worship, by truths from the Word, and by a life according to them, follows therefrom. 163.

For there is something of good in dead worship, because they think of God and of eternal life; but still good without its truths is not good, but meritorious or hypocritical, and evils and falsities take it away like a thief. This is done successively in the world, and after death fully, and also the man not knowing when and how. It is attributed to the Lord that “he will come like a thief,” but, in the spiritual sense, it is meant that hell will take away and steal it.

That the talent and pound to trade with is taken away from the man if nothing is gained by it, may be seen in Matt. 25:26–30; Luke 19:24–26. “To trade” and “to gain” signifies to acquire to one’s self truths and goods. [2] Since good and truth are taken away from those who are in dead worship, as if it were done by a thief in the dark, therefore in the Word the same is sometimes likened to a thief, as in the following passages: Behold, I come as a thief. Happy is he that watcheth and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked (Rev. 16:15). Watch therefore, for ye know not what hour your Lord will come. But know this, that if the householder had known in what hour the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken through (Matt. 24:42–43). If thieves came to thee, if destroyers by night, how wilt thou be cut off, would they not have stolen till they had enough? (Obad. 5). They shall run to and fro in the city, they shall run upon the wall, they shall go up upon the houses, they shall enter in through the windows like a thief (Joel 2:9). They have done a lie, and the thief cometh in, and the troop spreadeth itself without (Hos. 7:1). Lay not up treasures upon earth, but in heaven, where thieves do not come nor steal (Matt. 6:19–20). The reason why man must watch, and not know the hour in which the Lord cometh, is that man may think and act as from himself, thus in freedom according to his reason, and lest any fear intrude; for everyone, if he knew, would be in fear; and what man does from himself in freedom remains to eternity; but what he does from fear, does not remain."

The quality of those who are now treated of is that they have life in their worship. 166. Who have not defiled their garments signifies who are in truths, and have not defiled worship by evils of life, and falsities thence derived. By “garments” in the Word are signified truths which clothe good, and in the opposite sense, falsities which clothe evil; for man is either his own good or his own evil, the truths or falsities thence proceeding are his “garments.” All angels and spirits appear clothed according to the truths of their good, or according to the falsities of their evil; on which subject see the work Heaven and Hell, published at London (n. 177–182); from which it is evident, that by “not defiling their garments,” is signified to be in truths, and not to defile worship by evils of life and falsities thence derived. [2] That in the Word “garments” signify truths, and in the opposite sense falsities, appears from the following passages: Awake, awake, put on thy strength, O Zion; put on the garments of thy comeliness, O Jerusalem (Isa. 52:1). O Jerusalem, I have clothed thee with needlework, I have shod thee with badger’s skin, I have girded thee with fine linen, and adorned thee with ornaments; thou art arrayed in gold and silver, and thy garments are fine linen, silk, and needlework, whence thou hast become exceedingly beautiful. But thou hast taken off thy garments, and hast made for thyself high places with divers colors, that thou mightest commit whoredom upon them; thou hast also taken thy garments of needlework, and hast made images of a male, with which thou committedst whoredom (Ezek. 16:10–18). The Jewish church is here described, that to it were given truths, because it had the Word; but that they falsified them; “to commit whoredom” is to falsify (n. 134)."

No one putteth a piece of a new garment on an old garment; otherwise the new rendeth the old, and the piece from the new agreeth not with the old (Luke 5:36). Because “a garment” signifies truth, the Lord therefore compares the truths of the former church, which were external and representative of spiritual things, to “a piece of an old garment”; and the truths of the new church, which were internal and spiritual, to “a piece of a new garment.”"

That this is the meaning of these words is because “to walk,” in the Word signifies to live, and “to walk with God” signifies to live from him; and because “in white” signifies in truths; for in the Word, “white” is predicated of truths, because it draws its origin from the light of the sun; and “red” is predicated of goods, because it draws its origin from the fire of the sun; and “black” is predicated of falsities, because it draws its origin from the darkness of hell. They who are in truths from the Lord, because they are conjoined with him are called “worthy,” for all worth in the spiritual world is from conjunction with the Lord.

That “he that overcometh” signifies he who is reformed, may be seen above (n. 88); and that “to be clothed in white garments” signifies to become spiritual by means of truth (n. 166–167). All those become spiritual who are in truths, and in a life according to them. 169. And I will not blot out his name out of the book of life signifies that he shall be saved.

And I will confess his name before the Father, and before his angels signifies that they will be received who are in Divine good and in Divine truths from the Lord, thus who have the life of heaven in themselves. That “to confess the name” is to acknowledge the quality of anyone, or that he is such, is evident from the signification of “name,” as given above (n. 81, 122). By “Father,” is meant Divine good, and by “angels” are meant Divine truths, both from the Lord. In the word of the evangelists “the Father” is often mentioned by the Lord, by whom is everywhere meant Jehovah, from whom and in whom he was, and who was in him, and never any Divine separate from him: this is abundantly proved indeed in the Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Lord; and also in Angelic Wisdom concerning Divine Providence (n. 262–263); that the Lord himself is the Father, may be seen (n. 21, 960). The Lord made mention of the Father, because by “Father” in the spiritual sense is signified good, and by “God the Father” the Divine good of Divine love; the angels never understand anything else by “Father” when it is read in the Word, nor can they understand anything else, because no one in the heavens knows any Father, of whom they are said to be born, and whose sons and heirs they are called, except the Lord; this is meant by the Lord’s words (Matt. 23:9). Hence it is evident that by “confessing his name before the Father,” is signified that they will be received among those who are in Divine good from him. The reason why by “angels” are meant those who are in Divine truths from the Lord, and, abstractly, Divine truths, is because angels are the recipients of Divine good in the Divine truths which are with them from the Lord. 171. Verse 6. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches signifies that he who understands these things, should obey what the Divine truth of the Word teaches those who will be of the new church, which is the new Jerusalem, as above (n. 87)."

That these are meant by “the church in Philadelphia” is clear from what is written to it, when understood in the spiritual sense. 173. These things saith he that is holy, he that is true signifies the Lord as to the Divine truth. That it is the Lord is evident; the reason why “he that is holy, he that is true,” is the Lord as to the Divine truth is because the Lord is called “holy” from his Divine truth, and “just” from his Divine good; hence it is that his Divine proceeding, which is the Divine truth, is called “the Holy Spirit,” and the Holy Spirit here is “he that is holy, he that is true.” [2] “Holy” often occurs in the Word, and everywhere relates to truth, and as all truth, which in itself is truth, is from good, and is from the Lord, it is that truth which is called holy; but good from which the truth is is called just. Hence it is that the angels who are in the truths of wisdom, and are called spiritual, are said to be “holy,” and the angels who are in the good of love, and are called celestial, are said to be “just”; in like manner men in the church. It is also from this, that the prophets and apostles are called “holy,” for by “the prophets” and “apostles” are signified the truths of doctrine of the church. For the same reason also the Word is called holy, for the Word is the Divine truth; the law in the ark in the tabernacle was also called the holy of holies, and also “the sanctuary.” In like manner Jerusalem is called holy, for by “Jerusalem” is signified the church, which is in Divine truths. So likewise the altar, the tabernacle, and the garments of Aaron and his sons were called holy after they were anointed with oil, for oil signifies the good of love, and this sanctifies, and everything sanctified has relation to truth. [3] That the Lord alone is holy, because he is the Divine truth itself, is evident from the following passages: Who shall not glorify thy name, O Lord, for thou only art holy (Rev. 15:4)."

That “holy” is said of truth, and “just” of good, is evident from those passages in the Word where both expressions occur; as from the following: He that is just let him be justified still, and he that is holy let him be sanctified still (Rev. 22:11). Just and true are thy ways, thou king of saints (Rev. 15:3). To serve him in holiness and justice (Luke 1:75). Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just man and holy (Mark 6:20). Fine linen is the justice of the saints (Rev. 19:8). 174. He that hath the key of David, and that openeth and no one shutteth, and shutteth and no one openeth signifies who alone is omnipotent to save. By “David” is meant the Lord as to the Divine truth; by “key” is signified the Lord’s omnipotence over heaven and hell; and by “opening that no one can shut,” and by “shutting that no one can open,” is signified to lead forth out of hell and introduce into heaven, thus to save, in like manner as above (n. 62), where it is explained. That by “David” is meant the Lord as to the Divine truth, may be seen in the Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Lord (n. 43, 44). The same, which is here signified by “the key of David,” is also signified by “the keys of Peter” (Matt. 16:15–19); which may be seen explained below (n. 798), as also by these words to all the disciples: Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven (Matt. 18:18). For the twelve disciples represented all things of the church as to its goods and truths, and Peter represented it as to truth, and truths and goods save man, consequently the Lord alone from whom they are.

He was over the king’s house, and by “the king’s house” is signified the church as to the Divine truth. 175. Verse 8.

Behold, I have set before thee an open door signifies that heaven is open to those who are in truths from good from the Lord. That by “an open door” is signified admission is evident. The door is said to be open to those who are of the church in Philadelphia, because by that church are meant those who are in truths from good from the Lord, and to them the Lord opens heaven. But on this subject something not before known shall be declared. The Lord alone is the God of heaven and earth (Matt. 28:18); they therefore who do not directly approach him, cannot see the way to heaven, nor can they find the door, and if haply they are permitted to approach it, it is shut, and if they knock it is not opened. In the spiritual world there are actually ways which lead to heaven, and there are here and there gates, and they who are led to heaven by the Lord, take the ways which lead thither, and enter through the gates. That there are ways there, may be seen in the work Heaven and Hell (n. 479, 534, 590); and also gates (n. 429–430, 583–584). For all things which are seen in the heavens are correspondences, thus also, ways and gates; for ways correspond to truths, and thence signify them, and gates correspond to admission, and thence signify it. [2] Since the Lord alone leads man to heaven, and opens the door, therefore he calls himself “the way” and also “the door”: “the way” in John: I am the way, the truth, and the life (John 14:6). “The door” in the same evangelist:"

Since there are both ways and doors in the spiritual world, and angelic spirits actually go in those ways, and enter into heaven by doors, therefore “doors,” “gates,” and “portals” are frequently mentioned in the Word, by which is signified entrance; as in these places: Lift up your heads, O ye gates, lift them up, ye doors of the world, and the king of glory shall come in (Ps. 24:7, 9). Open ye the gates, that the just nation, which doeth fidelity, may enter in (Isa. 26:2). The five prudent virgins went in to the wedding, and the door was shut; and the five foolish virgins came and knocked, but it was not opened (Matt. 25:10–12). Jesus said, Strive to enter in at the straight gate, for many will seek to enter in, and shall not be able (Luke 13:24; besides others). Since “a door” signifies entrance, and “the new Jerusalem” signifies the church consisting of those who are in truths from good from the Lord, therefore the new Jerusalem is described also as to “its gates, upon which there were angels,” and it is said, They should not be shut (Rev. 21:12–13, 25). 177. And no one is able to shut it signifies that hell cannot prevail against it. For the Lord alone opens and shuts the doors to heaven, and the door which he opens is perpetually open to those who are in truths from good from the Lord, and perpetually shut to those who are in falsities from evil; and since the Lord alone opens and shuts, it follows that hell cannot prevail against them: more may be seen on this subject above (n. 174). 178.

To receive and acknowledge truths is signified by “coming and adoring at thy feet”; not at their feet, but at the feet of the Lord, from whom they have the truths from good; therefore the following passage in David has a like signification: Adore Jehovah our Lord, adore at his footstool (Ps. 99:5). 184.

(Matt. 24:3). “The consummation of the age” is the last time of the church, when the last judgment is at hand. The reason why by these words, “Behold, I come quickly,” the new church is also meant is because after the last judgment, the church is established by the Lord; that church now is the new Jerusalem, into which those will enter who are in truths from good from the Lord, to whom this is addressed. 188. Hold fast that thou hast signifies that in the meantime they should remain in their truths and in their good, as is manifest without explanation. 189. That no one take thy crown signifies lest wisdom should perish, from which comes eternal happiness. Wisdom in man is from no other source than good by truths from the Lord. The reason why man has wisdom through these is because the Lord conjoins himself to man, and man to himself by them, and the Lord is wisdom itself; therefore wisdom perishes with man when he ceases to do truths, that is, to live according to them, for then he ceases to love wisdom, and thus the Lord. By wisdom is meant wisdom in things spiritual, from which, as from a fountain, is derived wisdom in other things, which is called intelligence, and by intelligence, science, which exists from the affection of knowing truths. “A crown” signifies wisdom, because wisdom holds the supreme place with man, and thus crowns him. Nor does “a king’s crown” signify anything else, for “king,” in the spiritual sense, is the Divine truth (n. 20), and from the Divine truth is all wisdom."

The lion has come up from the thicket, to reduce the land to a waste; thy cities shall be destroyed; I saw Carmel a wilderness, and her cities desolate: the land shall mourn; the whole city shall flee, being deserted (Jer. 4:7, 26–29). “The land” here is the church, and “the city” is its doctrine. Thus is described the devastation of the church by the falsities of doctrine. The waster shall come upon every city, and no city shall escape, and the valley shall perish, and the plain be destroyed (Jer. 48:8). In like manner: Behold, I have made thee a fortified city against the whole land (Jer. 1:18). This was said to the prophet, because by “a prophet” the doctrine of the church is signified (n. 8). In that day it shall be sung in the land of Judah, We have a strong city; salvation will he put for walls, and bulwarks (Isa. 26:1). The great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell (Rev. 16:19). The prophet saw upon a high mountain the structure of a city to the south, and an angel measured the wall, the gates, the chambers, the porch of the gate; and the name of the city was Jehovah there (Ezek. 40:1 seq.).

In these places by cities, in the spiritual sense, are meant doctrines; as also in Isa. 6:11; 14:12, 17, 21; 19:18, 19; 25:1–3; 33:8, 9; 54:3; 64:10; Jer. 7:17, 34; 13:18, 19; 32:42, 44; 33:4; Zeph. 3:6; Ps. 48:2; 55:9; 107:4, 7; Matt. 5:14, 15, and elsewhere. [3] From the signification of “city” it may appear what is meant by cities in this parable of the Lord: A nobleman going away to receive for himself a kingdom, gave his servants pounds to trade with: when he returned, he called the servants: the first approached saying thy pound hath gained ten pounds; to whom he said, Good servant, thou shalt have authority over ten cities; and the second came saying thy pound hath gained five pounds; to whom he said, Be thou over five cities (Luke 19:12–19). By “cities” here, also, doctrinals or truths of doctrine are signified, and by “being over them” is meant to be intelligent and wise, thus to give “authority over them” is to give intelligence and wisdom; “ten” signifies much, and “five” something; that by “trading” and “gaining” is meant to acquire intelligence by the exercise of one’s faculties is evident. [4] That “the holy city Jerusalem” signifies the doctrine of the new church is plainly manifest from the description of it (Rev. 21); for it is described as to its dimensions, also as to the gates, and as to the wall, and its foundations, which, when Jerusalem signifies the church, cannot signify any other than things belonging to its doctrines. The church is a church from no other source. Since by “the city of Jerusalem” is meant the church as to doctrine, therefore it is called “the city of truth” (Zech. 8:3–4), and in many places “the holy city,” and this because holy is predicated of truths from the Lord (n. 173)."

That in the new church the Lord alone is worshiped is evident from chap. 21:9, 10, where that church is called the “lamb’s wife.” That there are new things in that church, appears from chap. 21:5, where it is said, “Behold, I make all things new.” Such therefore is the signification of “my new name,” which was to be written upon them. 197.

These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness signifies the Lord as to the Word, which is the Divine truth from him. That “amen” is Divine confirmation from the truth itself, which is the Lord, thus from the Lord, may be seen above (n. 23); and that “a faithful and true witness,” when spoken of the Lord, is the Divine truth which is from him in the Word (n. 6, 16). Whether you say that the Lord testifies of himself, or that the Word testifies of him, it is the same, because “the Son of man,” who here speaks to the churches, is the Lord as to the Word (n. 44). These things are premised to this church, because those in the church are here treated of who both believe from themselves and from the Word; and they who believe from the Word, believe from the Lord. 200. The beginning of the work of God signifies the Word. That the Word is “the beginning of the work of God,” is not yet known in the church, because they have not understood these words in John: In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and God was the Word. All things were made by him, and without him was not anything made that was made. In him was life, and the life was the light of men. He was in the world, and the world was made by him, but the world knew him not. And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only-begotten of the Father (John 1:1–14). He who understands these words in their interior sense, and at the same time compares them with what is written in Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning Sacred Scripture, as also with some things in Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Lord, may see that the Divine truth itself in the Word which was formerly in this world (as mentioned in n. 11), which likewise is in the Word which is at this day, is meant by “the Word which was in the beginning with God, and which was God”; but not the Word regarded as to the words and letters of the languages in which it is written, but regarded in its essence and life, which from the inmost"

All thought, speech, and writing, derives its essence and life from him who thinks, speaks, and writes; the man with his quality is therein; but the Lord alone is in the Word. No one however feels and perceives the Divine life in the Word but he who is in the spiritual affection of truth when he reads it, for he is in conjunction with the Lord through the Word. There is something intimately affecting the heart and spirit, which flows with light into the understanding and bears witness. [2] What is said in John has a similar signification to that of these words in the first chapter of Genesis: In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth, and the spirit of God moved itself upon the face of the waters; and God said, Let there be light, and there was light (Gen. 1:1–3). “The spirit of God” is the Divine truth, and also the Light; the Divine truth is the Word, therefore when the Lord calls himself the Word, he also calls himself “the Light” (John 1:4, 8–9). Similar things are also meant by this passage in David: By the Word of Jehovah were the heavens made, and all the host of them by the Spirit of his mouth (Ps. 33:6). In short, without the Divine truth of the Word, which in its essence is the Divine good of the Lord’s Divine love, and the Divine truth of his Divine wisdom, man cannot have life.

And what is wonderful, the Word is so written that it communicates with the entire heaven, and in particular with every society there, which it has been given me to know by living experience, of which elsewhere. That the Word in its essence is such is moreover evident from these words of the Lord: The words that I speak to you, they are spirit, and they are life (John 6:63). 201. Verse 15.

At one time to deny the holiness of the Word, and at another time to acknowledge it, is “to be neither cold nor hot,” for they are against the Word and also for the Word. They are also such concerning God, at one time they deny, and at another time acknowledge him; in like manner as to all things of the church; for which reason they are sometimes with those who are in hell, and at other times with those who are in heaven. They fly as it were between both, up and down, and wherever they fly, thither they turn the face. They become such who have confirmed with themselves the belief in the existence of God, of heaven and hell, and of life eternal, and afterwards recede from it. When the first confirmation returns, they acknowledge, but when it does not return, they deny. They recede because they afterwards think only of themselves and the world, continually aspiring to preeminence, and thereby they immerse themselves in their proprium; thus hell swallows them up."

I would thou wert cold or hot signifies that it is better for them either from the heart to deny the holy things of the Word and of the church, or from the heart to acknowledge them. The reason will be explained in the next article. 204. Verse 16. Therefore because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will vomit thee out of my mouth signifies profanation and consequent separation from the Lord. “To vomit out of my mouth” signifies to be separated from the Lord, and to be so separated from the Lord is to be neither in heaven nor in hell, but in a place apart, deprived of human life, where there are mere fantasies. The reason is because they have mixed truths with falsities, and goods with evils, thus holy things with profane, even so that they cannot be separated. And since man cannot then be prepared, either to be in heaven or in hell, the whole of his rational life is destroyed, and the ultimates of life alone remain, which, when separated from the interiors of life, are mere fantasies. Concerning their state and lot more may be seen in Angelic Wisdom concerning Divine Providence (n. 226–228, 231), which will suffice to give a knowledge of them. It is said of them that “they are vomited out,” because the world of spirits, which is in the midst between heaven and hell, and into which every man first comes after death, and is there prepared, corresponds to the stomach, in which all the things put in are prepared either to become blood and flesh, or to become excrement and urine, the latter having a correspondence with hell, but the former with heaven. But the things that are vomited out of the stomach are those that have not been separated, but remain commixed. By reason of this correspondence, the expression “to vomit” and “vomit” are used in the following passages: Drink and be drunken, and let thy foreskin be uncovered; and the cup of Jehovah shall go around unto thee, and the shameful vomiting shall be upon the glory (Hab. 2:15–16). Make Moab drunken, that he may clap the hands in his vomit (Jer. 48:26). All tables are full of the vomit of emptying; what one shall he teach knowledge? (Isa. 28:8–9)."

Because thou sayest, I am rich and increased in goods signifies that they think they possess in all abundance the knowledges of truth and good which are of the church and heaven. “To be rich and increased in goods,” here signifies nothing else than to know and understand fully such things as are of the church and heaven which are called spiritual and theological, because these are here treated of; spiritual riches and abundance are nothing else. They who believe from themselves, and not from the Lord through the Word, also believe that they know and understand all things. The reason is that their spiritual mind is shut, and their natural mind alone open; and this mind, without spiritual light, sees no otherwise. That by “riches” and “wealth” in the Word are signified spiritual riches and wealth, which are the knowledges of truth and good, is manifest from the following passages: In thy wisdom and in thy understanding thou hast gotten thee wealth, gold and silver in thy treasures; by the multiplication of thy wisdom thou hast multiplied thy wealth (Ezek. 28:4–5). This is spoken of Tyre, by which is signified the church as to the knowledges of truth and good. In like manner: The daughter of Tyre shall bring thee a gift; O daughter of the king, the rich peoples shall entreat thy faces (Ps. 45:12). Jehovah will impoverish Tyre; he will shake off her wealth into the sea (Zech. 9:4). O Tyre, they shall plunder thy wealth (Ezek. 26:12). Assyria said, By the strength of my hand I have done it, and by my wisdom, because I am intelligent; whence I will plunder the treasures of the peoples, my hand shall find the wealth of the peoples (Isa. 10:13–14). By Assyria the rational is signified; here that it perverts the goods and truths of the church, which here are the “treasures and wealth of the peoples,” which he will plunder."

Thus they are like those that build a house, and presently pull it down; or that clothe themselves in becoming garments, and presently tear them off. Their houses are therefore rubbish, and their garments rags. Such are all things which they think concerning the church and heaven, but they do not know this.

By “nakedness” is also signified innocence, and likewise ignorance of good and truth; innocence in the passage: They were both naked, the man and his wife, and had no cause for shame (Gen. 2:25). Ignorance of good and truth by these: This is the fast which I choose; to break bread to the hungry; and when thou seest the naked, to cover him (Isa. 58:6–7). Let him give his bread to the hungry, and cover the naked with a garment (Ezek. 18:7). I hungered, and ye gave me to eat; I was naked, and ye clothed me (Matt. 25:35–36). 214. And anoint thine eyes with eye salve, that thou mayest see signifies that their understanding may be healed, lest the genuine truths of wisdom should be profaned and falsified. That by “the eyes” is signified the understanding, and by “eyesight” intelligence and wisdom may be seen (n. 48). And since by “eye salve” a medicine for the same is signified, it follows that by “anoint thine eyes with eye salve” is signified to heal the understanding, that it may see truths and be wise; for unless this is the case, the genuine truths of the Word are profaned and adulterated. 215. Verse 19. As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten signifies that those of them who do so are loved by the Lord, and that then they cannot but be admitted to temptations that they may fight against themselves. That this is the sense of these words is evident, for it is said, “As many as I love,” by whom are meant they who “buy of the Lord gold purified in the fire,” and who “anoint their eyes with eye-salve that they may see.” It is said, “I rebuke and chasten” them, by which is meant temptation as to falsities and as to evils; by “rebuking” temptation as to falsities, and by “chastening” temptation as to evils.

Temptations are spiritual combats against the falsities and evils in one’s self, thus against one’s self. What temptations are, whence they proceed, and what good they produce, see New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine, published at London in the year 1758 (n. 187–201). 216. Be zealous, therefore, and repent signifies that this should be done from the affection of truth, and aversion from what is false. It is here said, “Be zealous,” because it was said above (verse 15), “I would thou wert either cold or hot,” here hot, for “zeal” is spiritual heat, and spiritual heat is the affection of love, here the affection of the love of truth, and he who acts from the affection of the love of truth acts also from aversion to what is false; therefore this is signified by “repent.” “Zeal” in the Word, when it treats of the Lord signifies love, and wrath; love in John 2:17; Psalm 69:9; Isaiah 37:32; 63:15; Ezekiel 39:25; Zechariah 1:14; 8:2. Wrath in Deuteronomy 32:16, 21; Psalm 79:5–6; Ezekiel 8:3, 5; 16:42; 23:25; Zephaniah 1:18; 3:8. But “zeal” in the Lord is not wrath, it only appears so in externals, interiorly it is love. It appears so in externals, because the Lord seems to be angry when he rebukes man, especially when man’s own evil punishes him. It is so permitted from love, that his evil may be removed; just like a parent, who, if he loves his children, suffers them to be chastised for the sake of removing their evils. Hence it is evident why Jehovah calls himself “zealous” (Deuteronomy 4:24; 5:9, 10; 6:14–15). 217. Verse 20. Behold, I stand at the door, and knock signifies that the Lord is present to everyone in the Word, and is there pressing to be received, and teaches how. Something similar to this is said by the Lord in Luke: Be ye like unto men that wait for their lord, when he will return from the wedding; that when he cometh and knocketh, they may open unto him immediately (Luke 12:36)."

If anyone hear my voice, and open the door signifies he who believes in the Word and lives according to it. “To hear his voice,” is to believe in the Word, for the Divine truth of the Word is “the voice of Jehovah” (n. 37, 50); and “to open the door” is to live according to it, because the door is not opened, and the Lord received, by merely hearing the voice, but by living according to it, for the Lord says: He that hath my commandments, and doeth them, I will manifest myself to him, and I will come unto him and make an abode with him (John 14:21–24). That man ought to open the door as from himself, by shunning evils as sins and doing goods is shown in the Doctrine of Life for the New Jerusalem; and that this is the case is also evident from the Lord’s words here, “If anyone open”; as also from his words in Luke 12:36. 219. I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me signifies that the Lord joins himself with them and them with himself. “To come in and sup with him” signifies to join himself to him, and, since there must be a reciprocal that there may be conjunction, it is also said, “and he with me.” That to be conjoined is signified by “coming in and supping,” appears from the holy supper instituted by the Lord, by means of which the Lord’s presence is effected with those who hear his voice, that is, who believe in the Word, but there is conjunction with those who live according to the Word; to live according to the Word is to do the work of repentance, and to believe in the Lord. “To sup,” and “the Lord’s supper,” are mentioned because supper takes place in the evening, and by “the evening” is signified the last time of the church; therefore when the Lord departed out of the world, the last time of the church being then arrived, he supped with his disciples, and instituted the sacrament of the supper. That “evening” signifies the last time of the old church and “morning” the first of the new church may be seen above (n. 151)."

This is evident from what has been said above. 221. Will I give to sit with me in my throne signifies that they will have conjunction with the Lord in heaven. That “the Lord’s throne” is heaven, may be seen above (n. 14), therefore “to sit with the Lord in his throne” signifies conjunction with him in heaven. 222. As I overcame, and sit with the Father in his throne signifies as he and the Father are one, and are heaven. That the Father and the Lord are one is fully shown in Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Lord, and elsewhere. That heaven is not heaven from anything proper to the angels, but from the Divine of the Lord, which is in the angels and with them; therefore by these words, “as I sit with the Father in his throne,” is signified as he and the Father are one, and are heaven; “throne” is heaven (n. 14, 221). “As I also overcame” signifies that by temptations admitted into his human, and by the last of them, which was the passion of the cross, as also by the fulfilling of all things of the Word, he overcame the hells and glorified his human, that is, he united it to his Divine which was in him from conception, and is called Jehovah the Father, on which subject see the above-mentioned Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Lord (n. 8–11, 12–14, 29–36), and also above (n. 67). [2] The reason why the Lord says, “To him that overcometh will I give to sit with me in my throne, as I overcame and sit with the Father in his throne,” is because the union of the Lord with the Father, that is, with his Divine within himself, took place, to the end that it might be possible for man to be conjoined to the Divine which is called the Father in the Lord; because it is impossible for man to be conjoined with the Divine of the Father immediately, but mediately through his Divine human, which is the Divine natural; therefore the Lord says: No one hath seen God at any time; the only-begotten son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he hath manifested him (John 1:18)."

Man, indeed, feels it as his own, but still it is not his, for it is not united to him, but adjoined; not so the Divine of the Father, this is not adjoined but united to the Lord’s human, as the soul to its body. He who understands these things may understand the following words of the Lord: He that abideth in me and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit, for without me ye can do nothing (John 15:5). In that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you (John 14:20).

To this I will add this relation. I saw an assembly of spirits, all upon their knees, praying to God to send angels to them, that they might converse with them face to face, and open to them the thoughts of their hearts. And when they arose, there appeared three angels in fine linen, standing before them, and they said, “The Lord Jesus Christ has heard your prayers, and has therefore sent us to you; open unto us the thoughts of your hearts.” [2] And they answered, “We have been told by our priests, that in matters of a theological nature the understanding avails nothing, but only faith, and that in such things intellectual faith is of no service to anyone, because it is derived from man. We are Englishmen, and have heard many things from our sacred ministry,"

This is not human; even magpies and ravens can learn to speak without understanding. We can affirm to you, that every man whose soul desires it is capable of seeing the truths of the Word in the light; there does not exist an animal that does not know the food proper to its life when it sees it, and man is a rational and spiritual animal, who sees the food of his life, not that of his body, but of his soul, which is the truth of faith, provided indeed he hungers after it, and seeks it from the Lord; whatsoever is not received also in the understanding is not fixed in the memory in reality, but only verbally; therefore, when we have looked down out of heaven into the world, we have not seen anything, but have only heard sounds, that are for the most part dissonant.

We have seen many such fall into pits, out of which they have never risen again. Examples must serve for illustration: are you not able to understand what charity is and what faith is; that charity consists in doing well by your neighbor, and that faith consists in thinking well of God and of the essentials of the church, and therefore that he who does well and thinks well, that is, who lives well and believes well, is saved?” They replied, that they understood these things. [6] The angels said further, “Do you not understand, that repentance from sins is to be performed, in order that man may be saved, and that, unless a man actually repents, he abides in the sins into which he was born, and that the work of repentance consists in not willing evils because they are against God, and in examining himself once or twice a year, in seeing his evils, in confessing them before the Lord, imploring assistance, desisting from them, and leading a new life, and as far as he does this, and believes in the Lord, so far his sins are remitted?” Then some of the company replied, “This we understand, and thence also what remission of sins is.” [7] And then they solicited the angels to give them further information, and especially concerning God, the immortality of the soul, regeneration and baptism. To this the angels replied, “We will not say anything but what you can understand, otherwise our discourse will fall like rain upon sand, and upon seeds therein, which although watered from heaven, still wither and perish.” Concerning God they said, “All who come into heaven have their place allotted them there, and thence eternal joy, according to their idea of God, because this idea reigns universally in every particular of worship.

The idea of God in heaven is the idea of the Lord. He is the God of heaven and earth, as he himself taught. Let your idea of God be like unto ours, and we shall be consociated together.” On saying these words, their faces became resplendent. [8] Concerning the immortality of the soul, they said, “Man lives to eternity, because he can be conjoined with God by love and faith, this indeed is possible with everyone. That this possibility constitutes the immortality of the soul you may understand, if you think of it a little more deeply.” [9] Concerning regeneration, “Who does not see that everyone is at liberty to think of God, or not to think of him, provided he be instructed that there is a God; so that everyone has liberty in spiritual things, equally as in things civil and moral; the Lord gives this liberty to all continually; for which reason he becomes guilty, if he does not think of God. Man is man from this ability; but a beast is a beast from not having this ability; therefore man can reform and regenerate himself as from himself, provided he acknowledges in heart that it is from the Lord. Everyone who does the work of repentance and believes in the Lord is reformed and regenerated. Man must do both as from himself, but this ‘as from himself’ is from the Lord. It is true that man cannot contribute anything thereto, no not in the least, nevertheless you were not created statues, but you were created men, that you might do that from the Lord as from yourselves. This is the only reciprocal of love and faith, that it is altogether the Lord’s will that it should be done by man unto him. In a word, do it from yourselves, and believe that you do it from the Lord, thus do it as from yourselves.” [10] But then the Englishmen inquired whether to act as from oneself is a faculty implanted in man from creation. The angel answered, “It is not implanted, because to act from himself is the Lord’s alone, but it is communicated continually, that is, adjoined continually, and then so far as man does good and believes what is"

But everyone incurs guilt who believes that he acts from himself, whether it be good, or whether it be evil; but he does not incur guilt, who believes that he acts as from himself.” [11] Concerning baptism, they said that it is spiritual washing, which is reformation and regeneration; and that an infant is reformed and regenerated, when, on becoming an adult, he does the things which his sponsors promised for him, which are two, repentance and faith in God; for they promise first that he shall renounce the devil and all his works; and second, that he shall believe in God. All infants in heaven are initiated into these two, but to them the devil is hell, and God is the Lord. Moreover baptism is a sign before the angels that a man is of the church. [12] On hearing these things, some of the assembly said, “This we understand.” But a voice was heard from one side, exclaiming, “We do not understand”; and another voice, “We will not understand”; and inquiry was made from whence these voices proceeded, and it was found that they came from those who had confirmed themselves in falsities of faith, and who wished to be believed as oracles, and thus to be adored. The angels said, “Be not surprised: there are very many such at this day; they appear to us from heaven like graven images, made with such art as to be able to move the lips, and utter sounds like organs, but without knowing whether the breath, by means of which they utter these sounds, comes from hell or from heaven, because they do not know whether a thing be false or true.

The bread and wine do not produce this effect, for there is nothing holy in them, but material bread and heavenly bread correspond mutually to each other, and so do material wine and heavenly wine; and heavenly bread is the holy of love, and heavenly wine is the holy of faith, both from the Lord, and both the Lord. Thence there is a conjunction of the Lord with man, and of man with the Lord, not with the bread and wine, but with the love and faith of the man who had done the work of repentance; and conjunction with the Lord is also introduction into heaven.” And after the angels had taught them something concerning correspondence and its effect, some of the company said, “Now for the first time we understand.” And when they said, “We understand,” behold a flame with light descending from heaven, consociated them with the angels, and they loved one another."

That “a voice,” when heard from heaven, is the inflowing Divine truth may be seen above (n. 37, 50), thus Divine influx; and that by “a voice as of a trumpet” is signified manifest perception, may also be seen above (n. 37); and by “Come up hither” is signified elevation of the mind; for in the spiritual world, the higher anyone ascends, so much the more does he come into purer light, by which the understanding is by degrees opened, that is, the mind is elevated. Therefore it also follows, that he was then in the spirit, by which is meant that he was let into a spiritual state, in which the things which are in the heavens manifestly appear. The voice was heard “as of a trumpet,” because it treats of the arrangement of the heavens for the last judgment; and voices as of a trumpet are heard in heaven when convocations and arrangements are made."

That “a throne” signifies heaven may be seen (n. 14); that a throne also signifies judgment, is evident from the following passages: When the son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory (Matt. 25:31 seq.).

I saw when the Ancient of Days did sit; his throne was as a flame of fire; a thousand and thousands ministered unto him, and a myriad of myriads stood before him, the judgment was set and the books were opened (Dan. 7:9–10). Jerusalem is built; thither the tribes go up; and there are set thrones for judgment (Ps. 122:3–5). I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them (Rev. 20:4). “The throne” built by Solomon, mentioned (1 Kings 10:18–20) signifies both kingdom and judgment; since kings, when they executed judgment, sat upon thrones. It is said that “the throne” signifies judgment in a representative form, because the things which John saw were visions which represented. They were seen as he has described; but they were forms representative of future things, as may be evident from what follows; as that there were seen animals, a dragon, beasts, a temple, a tabernacle, the ark, and many other things. Similar were the things which were seen by the prophets, spoken of above (n. 36). 230. And one sitting on the throne signifies the Lord, as appears manifestly from what follows, and from passages in the Word where it is said that the Lord will execute judgment (as in Matt. 25:32, 33; and following verses; John 5:22, 27; and elsewhere). 231. Verse 3. And he that sat was in appearance like a jasper and sardius stone signifies the appearance of the Lord’s Divine wisdom and Divine love in ultimates. “A stone,” in the Word signifies truth in ultimates, and “a precious stone,” truth transparent from good (n. 915). There are two colors fundamental of the rest in the spiritual world, the color white and the color red, the color white derives its origin from the light of the sun in heaven, thus from spiritual light, which is shining white; and the color red derives its origin from the fire of the sun there, thus from celestial light, which is flaming.

This is the reason why precious stones, in the Word signify such things as are of the truth of wisdom, or of the good of love, and that “the jasper,” because it is shining white signifies the things which are of the truth of wisdom; and “the sardius,” because it is red, the things which are of the good of love. These stones signify the appearance of the Divine wisdom and the Divine love in ultimates, because all precious stones in heaven derive their origin from the ultimates of the Word, and their transparency from the spiritual sense of the ultimates. That this is the case, may be seen in Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning Sacred Scripture (n. 44–45). The ultimates of the Word are the truths and goods of the sense of the letter. That this is the origin of precious stones in heaven can scarcely be believed by anyone in our world, because he does not know that all the things which exist in the spiritual world are correspondences, and that from thence all the things which exist in the natural world derive their spiritual origin. That this is the origin of precious stones in heaven has been granted me to know from speech with angels, and also to see it with my eyes, but the formation of them is from the Lord alone. But black colors, which are also two in number, derive their origin from hell; one in opposition to white, this blackness being with those who have falsified the truths of the Word; the other in opposition to red, this blackness being with those who have adulterated the goods of the Word; the latter blackness is diabolical, but the former satanic. The signification of “the jasper” and “the sardius” may be seen in the explanation of chap. 21:11, 18–20. 232. And there was a rainbow round about the throne in appearance like an emerald signifies the appearance of the same also round about the Lord. In the spiritual world there appear rainbows of many kinds, they appear of various colors as upon the earth, and they appear of one color; here of one color, because it is said “like unto an emerald.” This appearance was round about the Lord,"

He who does not know the spiritual sense of the Word, and at the same time the genuine truths of the church, may believe, that when the last judgment shall come, the Lord will sit upon a throne, and that there will be other judges also upon thrones around him. But he who knows the spiritual sense of the Word, and at the same time the genuine truths of the church, knows that the Lord will not then sit upon a throne, and that neither will there be other judges about him; and further, that neither will the Lord judge anyone to hell, but that the Word will judge everyone, the Lord moderating that all things may be done according to justice. The Lord says, indeed: The Father judgeth no one, but hath committed all judgment to the son, and hath given him authority to execute judgment, because he is the son of man (John 5:22, 27). But in another place he says: I came not to judge the world, but to save the world; the Word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day (John 12:47–48). These two passages agree, when it is known that “the son of man” is the Lord as to the Word (see above, n. 44). [2] Therefore the Word will judge, the Lord moderating. That by the twelve tribes of Israel and their elders are signified all who are of the Lord’s church in the heavens and on earth, and, abstractly, all the truths and goods therein, may be seen (n. 251, 349, 369, 808);"

Who cannot understand, that the apostles and elders will not judge; and that they cannot? From these considerations it may appear why “thrones” and “elders” are mentioned when the judgment is treated of; as also in Isaiah: Jehovah will enter into judgment with the elders of his people (Isa. 3:14). In David: Jerusalem is builded, whither the tribes go up; and there are set thrones for judgment (Ps. 122:3, 5).

These were seen to proceed “from the throne,” because they proceed from the son of man, or from the Lord as to the Word, and from the Lord through the Word come all enlightenment, perception, and instruction. “Lightnings, thunders, and voices,” have a similar signification in other parts of the Word, as in these passages: Thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people: the skies gave forth a voice; the voice of thunder went into the world; the lightnings enlightened the world (Ps. 77:15, 17–18).

I heard a voice out of heaven as a voice of great thunder (Rev. 14:2). When the angel cast the censer unto the earth, there were thunders, voices, and lightnings (Rev. 8:5).

Neither is it anything extraordinary that the Word is described by animals, since the Lord himself in many parts of the Word is called “a lion,” and often “Lamb,” and they who are in charity from the Lord are called “sheep”; and the understanding also of the Word, in what follows, is called “a horse.” That the Word is signified by these “animals” or “cherubim” is evident from this, that they were seen “in the midst of the throne and round about the throne,” and in the midst of the throne was the Lord, and, as the Lord is the Word, they could not be seen anywhere else.

To prevent this, the literal sense guards, and it guards with those who are in falsities from religion, but yet do not confirm them, for from these the Word suffers no violence.

This guard is signified by “the cherubim,” which after the expulsion of Adam and his wife from the garden of Eden, were placed at its entrance; concerning which we read: When Jehovah God had driven out the man, he made to dwell from the east to the garden of Eden cherubim, and a flame of a sword, which turned every way, to guard the way of the tree of life (Gen. 3:23–24). By “cherubim” is signified a guard; by “the way of the tree of life” is signified admission to the Lord, which is given to men through the Word; by “a flame of a sword which turned every way” is signified the Divine truth in ultimates, which is as the Word in the sense of the letter, that allows of being turned this way and that.

In like manner: The remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of the people, as a lion among the beasts of the forests, as a young lion among the flocks of sheep (Micah 5:7–8; besides many other places; as Isa. 11:6; 21:6–9; 35:9; Jer. 2:15; 4:7; 5:6; 12:8; 50:17; 51:38; Ezek. 19:3, 5–6; Hos. 13:7–8; Joel 1:6–7; Nahum 2:12; Ps. 17:12; 22:13; 57:4; 58:6; 91:13; 104:21–22; Deut. 33:20). 242. And the second animal like a calf signifies the Divine truth of the Word as to affection. By the beasts of the earth are signified the various natural affections, for such indeed they are; and by “a calf” is signified the affection of knowing; in the spiritual world this affection is represented by a calf, therefore it is also signified by “a calf” in the Word, as in Hosea: We will render unto Jehovah the calves of our lips (Hos. 14:2). “Calves of the lips” are confessions from the affection of truth. In Malachi: But unto you that fear my name, shall the sun of justice arise, and healing in his wings, that ye may grow up as fatted calves (Mal. 4:2)."

In David: The voice of Jehovah maketh the cedars of Lebanon to skip like a calf (Ps. 29:6). By “the cedars of Lebanon” are signified the knowledges of truth; hence it is said that “the voice of Jehovah maketh them to skip like a calf.” “The voice of Jehovah” is the Divine truth, here affecting. [2] Since the Egyptians loved the sciences, they made to themselves calves as a sign of their affection for them; but afterwards they began to worship the calves as gods, then by them, in the Word, are signified the affections of knowing falsities as in Jeremiah (46:20, 21; Psalm 68:30); and in other places; therefore the same is signified by the calf which the sons of Israel made for themselves in the wilderness (Exodus 32); as also by the calves of Samaria (1 Kings 12:28–32; Hosea 8:5; 10:5). Therefore it is said in Hosea: They make for themselves a molten image of silver, sacrificing a man, they kiss the calves (Hos. 13:2). To “make for themselves a molten image of silver” signifies to falsify truth, “to sacrifice a man” signifies to destroy wisdom, and “to kiss calves” signifies to acknowledge falsities from affection. In Isaiah: There shall the calf feed, and there shall he lie down and consume the branches thereof (Isa. 27:10). The same is signified by calf in Jeremiah 34:18–20. [3] Since all Divine worship is from the affections of truth and good, and thence from the knowledge of them, therefore sacrifices, in which the worship of the church with the sons of Israel chiefly consisted, were made of various beasts, such as lambs, goats, kids, sheep, he-goats, calves, oxen; they were from calves, because they"

The second animal appeared like a calf, because the Divine truth of the Word, which is signified by it, affects minds and thus instructs and imbues. 243. And the third animal having a face like a man signifies the Divine truth of the Word as to wisdom. By “a man,” in the Word, is signified wisdom, because he is born that he may receive wisdom from the Lord, and become an angel; therefore in proportion as anyone is wise, in the same proportion he is a man. Wisdom truly human consists in knowing that there is a God, what God is, and what is of God; this the Divine truth of the Word teaches. That by “a man” is signified wisdom, is plain from the following places: I will make a man [vir] more rare than pure gold; even a man [homo] than the gold of Ophir (Isa. 13:12). Man [vir homo] is intelligence, and man [homo] is wisdom: The inhabitants of the earth shall be burned, and rare shall be the man that is left (Isa. 24:6). I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man and with the seed of beast (Jer. 31:27). And ye, my flock, are man, I am your God (Ezek. 34:31). The devastated cities shall be filled with the flocks of man (Ezek. 36:38). I beheld the earth, and lo, it was vacant and empty; and the heavens, and they had no light; I beheld, and lo, there was no man (Jer. 4:23, 25). They sacrifice a man, they kiss calves (Hos. 13:2).

And the fourth animal was like a flying eagle signifies the Divine truth of the Word as to knowledges, and thence understanding. By “eagles” various things are signified, and by “flying eagles” are signified knowledges from which understanding is derived, because when they fly they both know and see; for they have sharp eyes that they may see clearly, and by “eyes” are signified the understanding (n. 48, 214): by “flying” is signified to receive and instruct, and, in the highest sense, in which it has relation to the Lord, it signifies to foresee and provide. That “eagles” in the Word have such a signification, appears from these passages: They that wait for Jehovah shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles (Isa. 40:31). “To mount up with wings as eagles” is to be elevated into the knowledges of truth and good, and thence into intelligence: Is it by thy intelligence and according to thy mouth that the eagle lifteth himself and searcheth out his food; his eyes see clearly afar (Job. 39:26–27, 29). The faculty of knowing, understanding, and seeing clearly, is here described by “the eagle,” and that this is not from man’s own intelligence. Jehovah who satisfieth thy mouth with good so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle (Ps. 103:5). “To satisfy the mouth with good” is to give understanding by knowledges; hence a comparison is made with the eagle. A great eagle, great in wings, long in feathers, came upon Lebanon, and took a twig of a cedar, and placed it in a field of seed, and it grew. And there was also another great eagle, to which the vine applied its roots (Ezek. 17:1–8)."

And the four animals each by himself had six wings about him signifies the Word as to its powers and as to its guards. That by “the four animals” the Word is signified, was shown above; that by wings are signified powers, and also guards, will be seen below. By “six” is signified all as to truth and good, for six is composed of “three” and “two” multiplied together, and by “three” is signified all as to truth (n. 505), and by “two” all as to good (n. 762). By “wings” are signified powers, because by them birds lift themselves up, and wings with birds are in the place of arms with men, and by “arms” are signified powers. Since by “wings” are signified powers, and each animal had six wings, it is evident, from what has been said above, what kind of power is signified by the wings of each, namely, that by “the wings of the lion” is signified the power of fighting against evils and falsities from hell; which power is of the Divine truth of the Word from the Lord. That by “the wings of the calf” is signified the power of affecting minds, for the Divine truth of the Word affects those who read it as holy. That by “the six wings of the man” is signified the power of being wise as to what God is, and what is of God, for this is properly man’s in reading the Word: and that by “the wings of the eagle” is signified the power of knowing truth and good, and thereby acquiring intelligence for oneself. [2] Concerning the wings of the cherubim we read in Ezekiel that: The wings kissed each other, and that they also covered their bodies, and that under them there was the likeness of hands (Ezek. 1:23–24; 3:13; 10:5, 21)."

Concerning “the seraphim,” it is also said, that: They had six wings; with two of which they covered the face, and with two the feet, and with two they flew (Isa. 6:2). By “seraphim” in like manner is signified the Word, properly doctrine from the Word, and by “the wings with which they covered the faces and feet,” in like manner are signified guards, and by “the wings with which they flew,” powers, as above.

I saw an angel flying through the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel (Rev. 14:6).

That by “the animals were full of eyes before and behind” is signified the Divine wisdom in the Word, may be seen above (n. 240); in like manner here, by “their wings were full of eyes.” And because the Divine wisdom of the Word in its natural sense is from its spiritual and celestial senses, which are concealed within, it is therefore said, that “within they were full of eyes.” Concerning the spiritual and celestial senses, which are contained in every particular of the Word, see Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning Sacred Scripture (n. 5–26). 247. And they had no rest day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty signifies that the Word continually teaches of the Lord, and that he alone is God, and thence that he alone is to be worshiped. “The animals had no rest day and night” signifies that the Word continually, and without intermission, teaches; and that it teaches what the animals say, namely, “Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty,” that is, that the Lord alone is God, and thence that he alone is to be worshiped. This is what is signified by holy three times repeated, for the triplication involves all holiness in him alone. That the Divine trinity is in the Lord, is fully shown in Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Lord; as also that the Word treats of the Lord alone, and that thence is its sanctity. That the Lord alone is holy, may be seen above (n. 173). 248. Who was, and who is, and who is to come signifies the Lord. That it is the Lord is plain from chap. 1:4, 8, 11, 17, where it treats of the son of man who is the Lord as to the Word, and there it is expressly said that: He is the alpha and the omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last, who is, and who was, and who is to come, the almighty (Rev. 1:8)."

Verse 9. And when these animals gave glory, and honor, and thanks to him that sat upon the throne signifies that the Word ascribes all truth, and all good, and all worship to the Lord, who is to judge. “The animals” are the Word, as has been shown; “glory and honor,” when ascribed to the Lord, mean, that all truth and all good are his and from him; “thanks” signify the all of worship; “he that sat on the throne” signifies the Lord as to judgment, as above. Hence it is evident, that by “when the animals gave glory, and honor, and thanks to him that sat on the throne” is signified that the Word ascribes all truth, and all good, and all worship, to the Lord who is to judge. By “giving the Lord glory and honor,” nothing else is meant in the Word than to acknowledge and confess that all truth and all good is from him, thus that he alone is God, for he has glory from the Divine truth, and honor from the Divine good. [2] This is signified by “glory and honor” in the following passages: Jehovah made the heavens, glory and honor are before him (Ps. 96:5–6). O Jehovah, O God, thou art very great, thou art clothed with glory and honor (Ps. 104:1). The works of Jehovah are great, glory and honor are his work (Ps. 111:2–3). Glory and honor thou layest upon him, blessings for ever (Ps. 21:5–6).

And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book, written within and on the back signifies the Lord as to his Divine itself from eternity, who has omnipotence and omniscience, and who is the Word; who also knows from himself the state of the life of all in the heavens and on the earths, in every particular and in general. By “him that sat on the throne” is meant the Lord as to his Divine, from which is his human, for it follows that “the lamb took the book out of the right hand of him that sat on the throne” (verse 7), and by “the lamb” is meant the Lord as to the Divine human. By “the book written within and on the back” is meant the Word in every particular and in every general; by “within,” in every particular, and by “on the back” in every general. By “within and on the back” is also meant the interior sense of the Word, which is spiritual, and its exterior sense, which is natural; by “right hand” is meant himself as to omnipotence and omniscience, because the exploration of all in the heavens and on the earths, upon whom the last judgment is to be executed, and their separation, is treated of. The Lord, as the Word, knows the states of life of all in the heavens and on the earths from himself, because he is the Divine truth itself, and the Divine truth itself knows all things from itself; but this is an arcanum, which is revealed in Angelic Wisdom concerning Divine Love and Wisdom. That the Lord as to his Divine from eternity was the Word, that is, the Divine truth, is evident from these words in John: In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and God was the Word (John 1:1). And that the Lord as to his human also was made “the Word,” in the same: And the Word became flesh (John 1:14). Hence it may appear what it means that the book was in the right hand of him that sat on the throne, and that the lamb took the book thence (Rev. 5:7)."

Let them be blotted out of the book of life, and not be written with the just (Ps. 69:28). I saw that the books were opened, and another book was opened, which is the book of life, and the dead were judged according to those things which were written in the book according to their works, and whosoever was not found written in the book of life, was cast into the lake of fire (Rev. 20:12, 15). None shall enter into the new Jerusalem, but them that are written in the lamb’s book of life (Rev. 21:27). All shall adore the beast whose names are not written in the lamb’s book of life (Rev. 13:8; 17:8).

That “to be sealed with a seal” signifies to be hidden is evident, hence “to be sealed with seven seals” signifies to be altogether hidden, for “seven” signifies all (n. 10), and therefore altogether; that it was altogether hidden from angel and man, is presently said in these words: And no one in heaven, nor on earth, neither under the earth, was able to open and read the book, neither to look thereon (Rev. 5:3). Such is the Word to all to whom the lamb, that is, the Lord, does not open it. Here, because the exploration of all before the last judgment is treated of, it is the states of life of all in general and in particular, which are altogether hidden. 258. Verse 2. And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a great voice signifies the Divine truth from the Lord flowing in deeply into the thought of angels and men, and investigation.

That by “opening the book,” is signified investigation into the quality of the states of life in all and everyone, is evident from the following chapter, where is described what was seen, when the lamb opened the seven seals in their order. 260. Verse 3. And no one in heaven, nor on earth, neither under the earth, was able signifies that no one in the higher heavens or the lower heavens was able. “In heaven, on earth, and under the earth,” mean in the higher and in the lower heavens, in like manner as in the 13th verse, where it is said: And every created thing which is in heaven, on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying (Rev. 5:13). Since he heard the latter and the former saying, it is evident that they were angels and spirits who spoke; for John was in the spirit, as he himself says in the preceding chapter (4:2), in which state no other earth appeared to him than the earth of the spiritual world; for there are earths there as well as in the natural world, as may appear from the description of that world in Heaven and Hell; as also in Continuation concerning the Spiritual World (n. 32–38). The higher heavens appear there upon mountains and hills, the lower heavens in the earth beneath, and the ultimate heavens as it were under the earth. For the heavens are expanses one above another, and each expanse is like the earth under the feet of those who are there. The highest expanse is like the top of a mountain, the next expanse is under it, but extending itself more widely on all sides round about, and the lowest expanse more widely still; and since this last is under the other, they who are there are “under the earth.” The three heavens also appear thus to the angels who are in"

He who does not know anything of the spiritual world and the earths there, can by no means know what is meant by “under the earth,” nor by “the lower parts of the earth,” in the Word, as in Isaiah: Sing, O heavens, shout, ye lower parts of the earth, resound with singing, ye mountains, for Jehovah hath redeemed Jacob (Isa. 44:23; and in other places). Who does not see that the earths of the spiritual world are here meant? for no man lives under the earth in the natural world. 261.

For the Lord alone sees the state of everyone from inmosts to outmosts, as also what a man has been from infancy to old age, and what he will be to eternity, and likewise what place will be allotted to him either in heaven or in hell; and this the Lord sees in an instant, and from himself, because he is the Divine truth itself or the Word; but angels and man do not see this in the least, because they are finite, and the finite see only a few things, and those only external, and not these indeed from themselves, but from the Lord."

That “to weep much” is to grieve at heart, is evident; the reason why he grieved at heart, was, because otherwise all would have perished; for if all things in the heavens and on the earth were not reduced to order by the last judgment, it could not be otherwise; for Revelation treats of the last state of the church, when it comes to its end, the nature of which state is described by the Lord in these words: There shall be great affliction, such as was not from the beginning of the world to this time, nor shall be; therefore except those days should be shortened, no flesh would be saved (Matt. 24:21, 22). These are concerning the last time of the church, when judgment takes place. [2] That such is the state of the church at this day, may be known solely from these considerations, that the greatest part of the Christian world is occupied by those who have transferred to themselves the Divine power of the Lord, and wish to be worshiped as gods, and who invoke dead men, and scarce any of them the Lord; and that the rest of the church make God three, and the Lord two, and place salvation, not in amendment of life, but in certain words uttered with a devout tone; thus not in repentance, but in confidence that they are justified and sanctified, provided they do but fold their hands and look upwards, and pray in the customary form. 264.

Hence it is evident, what is meant by “the lion hath prevailed.” 266. Which is of the tribe of Judah, the root of David signifies by the Divine good united to the Divine truth in his human. By “Judah,” in the Word, is meant the church which is in the good of love to the Lord, and in the highest sense the Lord as to the Divine good of the Divine love; and by “David” is meant the Lord as to the Divine truth of the Divine wisdom. That this is meant by “David,” may be seen in Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Lord (n. 43, 44); and that the former is meant by “ Judah,” may be seen (n. 96, 266, 350). Hence it appears that by “Behold the lion which is of the tribe of Judah, the root of David hath prevailed,” is signified that the Lord overcame the hells and reduced all things to order by the Divine good united to the Divine truth in his human. That this is the sense of these words, cannot be seen in the sense of the letter, but only that it is he himself who was born in the world of the tribe of Judah and of the stock of David. Still, however, these words contain in them a spiritual sense, in which by the names of persons are meant things, as has frequently been observed above, thus by “Judah” is not meant Judah, nor by “David,” David; but by “Judah,” the Lord as to the Divine good, and by “David,” the Lord as to the Divine truth. Hence it is that this sense results therefrom. The reason why this sense is here explained is because Revelation as to its spiritual sense is now opened. 267.

From these things it follows, that, “in the midst of the throne, and of the four animals, and in the midst of the elders” signifies from inmosts in all things of heaven, the Word, and the church. 269. A lamb standing as if slain signifies the Lord as to his human, not acknowledged in the church as Divine. By “lamb,” in Revelation, is meant the Lord as to the Divine human, and by “a lamb slain,” that his human is not acknowledged in the church as Divine; in like manner as in chapter 1:18, where it is said: I was made dead, and behold I am alive for ages of ages (Rev. 1:18). By which is meant that the Lord is neglected in the church, and his human not acknowledged as Divine (n. 59); that this is the case may be seen below (n. 294). Since, therefore, the Lord as to the Divine human is meant by “the lamb,” and it is said of him, that “he took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne,” and afterwards that “he opened it, and loosed the seven seals thereof,” and since no mortal could do this, but God alone, it follows, that by “the lamb” is meant the Lord as to the Divine human, and by “slain,” that he is not acknowledged as God as to his human. 270. Having seven horns signifies his omnipotence. “A horn” is frequently mentioned in the Word, and by it is everywhere signified power; therefore when “a horn” is predicated of the Lord, it signifies omnipotence. The reason why “seven horns” are mentioned, is, because “seven” signifies all (n. 10), thus omnipotence. That “a horn” signifies power, and when applied to the Lord, omnipotence, may appear from the following passages: They who rejoice at a thing of naught, who say, have we not taken us horns by our own strength?

Having every one of them harps signifies confession of the Lord’s Divine human from spiritual truths. It is known that confessions of Jehovah were made in the temple at Jerusalem by singing, and at the same time by instruments of music which corresponded; the instruments were principally trumpets and timbrels, and psalteries and harps; the trumpets and timbrels corresponded to celestial goods and truths, and the psalteries and harps to spiritual goods and truths; the correspondences were with their sounds. What celestial good and truth is, and what spiritual good and truth, may be seen in Heaven and Hell (n. 13–19, and 20–28). That “harps” signify confessions of the Lord from spiritual truths, may appear from these passages: Confess to Jehovah with the harp, sing unto him with the psaltery of ten strings (Ps. 33:2). I will confess to thee on the harp, O God, my God (Ps. 43:4). I will confess to thee on the instrument of the psaltery, I will sing unto thee with the harp, O thou holy one of Israel (Ps. 71:22). Arouse me psaltery and harp, I will confess thee among the nations, O Lord (Ps. 57:8, 9; 108:2–4). Answer to Jehovah by confession, play on the harp to our God (Ps. 147:7). It is good to confess to Jehovah upon the psaltery, and upon higgaion on the harp (Ps. 92:2–4). Make a joyful noise unto Jehovah all the earth, sing unto Jehovah with the harp, with the harp and the voice of singing (Ps. 98:4–6; and in many other places; as Ps. 43:4; 137:2; Job 30:31; Isa. 24:7–9; 30:31, 32; Rev. 14:2; 18:22).

And golden vials full of incense signifies confession of the Lord’s Divine human from spiritual good. The reason why “incense” signifies worship from spiritual goods, but in this instance confession from such goods, is because the principal worship in the Jewish and Israelitish church consisted in sacrifices and incense; wherefore there were two altars, one for sacrifices and the other for incense; the latter altar was within the tabernacle, and was called the golden altar, but the former was without the tabernacle, and was called the altar of burnt offering; the reason was, because there are two kinds of goods, from which all worship exists, celestial good and spiritual good: celestial good is the good of love to the Lord, and spiritual good is the good of love towards the neighbor. Worship by sacrifices was worship from celestial good, and worship by incense was worship from spiritual good. Whether you call it worship or confession, it is the same thing, for all worship is confession. What is signified by “incense,” is also signified by “the vials” in which the incense is contained, because the thing containing and the thing contained, like the instrumental and principal, act as one cause. [2] Worship from spiritual good is signified by “incense” in the following passages: For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same, my name shall be great among the Gentiles, and in every place incense shall be offered unto my name (Mal. 1:11). They shall teach Jacob thy judgments, they shall put incense in thy nostril and a burnt offering upon thine altar (Deut. 33:10). I will offer unto thee burnt offerings of fatlings, with incense (Ps. 66:13, 15). And they shall come from the circuit of Judah, offering a burnt offering, and a sacrifice, a meal offering and incense (Jer. 17:26)."

By “frankincense” the same is signified as by “incense,” because frankincense was the principal aromatic from which incense was made. Likewise in Matthew: The wise men from the east opened their treasures, and offered to the Lord recently born, gold, frankincense, and myrrh (Matt. 2:11). The reason why they offered these three was, because “gold” signified celestial good, “frankincense” spiritual good, and “myrrh” natural good, and from those three goods all worship is made. 278. Which are the prayers of saints signifies thoughts which are of faith, from affections which are of charity, with those who worship the Lord from spiritual goods and truths. By “prayers” are meant the things which are of faith, and at the same time things which are of charity, with those who pour forth prayers, because prayers without them are not prayers, but empty sounds. That “saints” mean those who are in spiritual goods and truths, may be seen above (n. 173). The reason why incense is called “the prayers of saints” is because fragrant odors correspond to the affections of good and truth; hence it is, that “a grateful odor” and “an odor of rest to Jehovah,” so often occur in the Word (as in Exodus 29:18, 25, 41; Leviticus 1:9, 13, 17; 2:2, 9, 12; 3:5; 4:31; 6:15, 21; 8:28; 23:13, 18; 26:31; Numbers 15:3, 7; 28:6, 8, 13; 29:2, 6, 8, 13, 36; Ezekiel 20:41; Hosea 14:7). “Prayers” which are called “incense” have a similar signification in the following passages in Revelation: An angel stood at the altar having a golden vial, and there was given unto him much incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar; and the smoke of the incense with the prayers of the saints, ascended up before God out of the angel’s hand (Rev. 8:3–5). And in David: Give ear unto my voice; my prayers have been accepted before thee as incense (Ps. 141:1–2)."

And they sung a new song signifies acknowledgment and glorification of the Lord, that he alone is the judge, redeemer, and savior, thus the God of heaven and earth.

Since the acknowledgment that the Lord alone is the God of heaven and earth, and that his human is Divine, and that in no other way could he be called the redeemer and savior, was not before in the church, it is therefore called a “new song.” [2] The reason why “a song” also signifies glorification, which is confession from joy of heart, is because singing exalts, and causes affection to break out from the heart into sound, and show itself intensely in its life. Nor are the Psalms of David any other than songs; for they were played and sung, and therefore were also called songs in many passages (as Ps. 18:1; 33:1; 45:1; 46:1; 48:1; 65:1; 66:1; 67:1; 68:1; 75:1; 76:1; 87:1; 88:1; 92:1; 96:1; 98:1; 108:1; 120:1; 121:1; 122:1; 123:1; 124:1; 125:1; 126:1; 127:1; 128:1; 129:1; 130:1; 132:1; 133:1; 134:1)."

As, therefore, they are thus one with the Lord, and, together with the Lord, constitute a kingdom, which is called the kingdom of God, it is evident that nothing else is signified by “reigning.” It is said “to reign” because it was before said, “Thou hast made us kings and priests”; and by “kings” are signified they who are in wisdom from Divine truths from the Lord; and by “priests,” they who are in love from Divine good from him (n. 20); hence it is that the kingdom of the Lord is also called “the kingdom of the saints” (Dan. 7:18, 27); and it is said of the apostles, that: With the Lord they should judge the twelve tribes of Israel (Matt. 19:28).

That “riches” signify the knowledges of good and truth, and thus science, may be seen above (n. 206); therefore, when said of the Lord, they signify omniscience; and that “honor and glory,” when spoken of the Lord signify the Divine good and the Divine truth, see above (n. 249). 289. And blessing signifies all these things in him, and from him in them. By “blessing” is meant every good which man receives from the Lord, as power and opulence, and all that is implied by them; but especially every spiritual good, as love and wisdom, charity and faith, and the joy and felicity thence, which are of eternal life; and because all these are from the Lord, it follows that they are in him, for unless they were in him, they could not be in others from him. Hence it is, that, in the Word, the Lord is called “blessed,” and also “blessing,” that is, blessing itself. That Jehovah, that is the Lord, is called “blessed,” is evident from these passages: The high priest asked Jesus, Art thou the Christ, the son of the blessed? (Mark 14:61). Jesus said, Ye shall not see me henceforth, till ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord (Matt. 23:39; Luke 13:35). Melchizedek blessed Abram, and said, Blessed be God most high who hath given thine enemies into thy hand (Gen. 14:18-20). Blessed be Jehovah the God of Shem (Gen. 9:26). Blessed be Jehovah, who hath heard my voice (Ps. 28:6). Blessed be Jehovah, for he hath made marvelous his kindness (Ps. 31:21)."

In like manner Ps. 66:20; 68:19, 35; 72:18, 19; 89:52; 119:12; 124:6; 135:21; 144:1; Luke 1:68). This is the reason why “blessing” is here mentioned, as also verse 12, and 7:12; and likewise in David: Glory and honor dost thou lay upon him, for thou makest him a blessing for ever (Ps. 21:5, 6). [2] These are concerning the Lord. Hence it may be seen what is meant in the Word by “blessing God,” namely, to ascribe to him all blessing; also to pray that he would bless, and to give thanks for having blessed; as may appear from the following passages: The mouth of Zacharias was opened, and he spoke, blessing God (Luke 1:64, 68). Simeon took up the infant Jesus in his arms, and blessed God (Luke 2:28, 30–31). Bless ye Jehovah, who hath counselled for me (Ps. 16:7). Bless the name of Jehovah, evangelize his salvation from day to day (Ps. 96:1–3). Blessed be the Lord from day to day, bless ye God in the congregations, even the Lord from the fountain of Israel (Ps. 68:19, 26). 290. Verse 13. And every created thing which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying signifies confession and glorification of the Lord by the angels of the lowest heavens. That this is a confession and glorification of the Lord by the angels of the lowest heavens is evident from the series, because the confessions and glorifications of the Lord which precede were made by the angels of the higher and lower heavens (n. 275, and following numbers, n. 286, and following numbers); for there are three heavens, and innumerable societies in each, and each of them is called a heaven."

And since the Word is written by mere correspondences, similar things are said of the angels of heaven and the men of the church; in proof of which a few passages only shall be adduced, which are as follows: Jesus said to his disciples, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature (Mark 16:15). Ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the birds of heaven and they shall tell thee; or the shrub of the earth, and it shall teach thee, and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee; who knoweth not from all these, that the hand of Jehovah hath done this? (Job 12:7–9). Let the heaven and earth praise Jehovah, the seas, and all that creepeth therein, for God will save Zion (Ps. 69:34–35). Praise Jehovah from the earth, ye whales and all deeps (Ps. 148:7). I will utterly consume all things from upon the face of the earth, I will consume man and beast, I will consume the birds of the heavens, and the fishes of the sea (Zeph. 1:2–3; likewise in Isa. 50:2–3; Ezek. 38:19–20; Hos. 4:2–3; Rev. 8:7–9). The heavens shall be glad, and the earth shall rejoice; the sea shall be moved, and the fullness thereof; the field shall exult, and all that is therein; then shall all the trees of the wood sing before Jehovah, for he cometh; for he cometh to judge the earth (Ps. 96:11–13; and in many other places)."

Blessing, and honor, and glory, and power, be unto him that sitteth upon the throne and unto the lamb for ages of ages signifies that in the Lord from eternity, and thence in his Divine human, is the all of heaven and the church, the Divine good, and the Divine truth, and the Divine power, and from him in those who are in heaven and in the church. That the Lord from eternity is Jehovah, who took upon him the human in time, that he might redeem and save men, may be seen above (n. 281); therefore by “him that sitteth upon the throne,” is meant the Lord from eternity, who is called the Father, and by “the lamb,” the Lord as to the Divine human, which is the son; and because the Father is in the son, and the son in the Father, and they are one, it is evident that by both, or by “him that sitteth upon the throne and the lamb,” the Lord is meant; and because they are one, it is also said that “the lamb was in the midst of the throne” (verse 6; also 7:17). That “blessing,” when spoken of the Lord, is the all of heaven and of the church in him and from him, in those who are in heaven and in the church, may be seen above (n. 289).

But in the spiritual world man’s speech is not twofold, but single.

[3] They who had confirmed themselves in faith separate from charity, were then asked to name “Jesus”; but they could not; yet they could all say Christ, and also God the Father. This they wondered at, and inquired into the cause, which they found to be this, that they had prayed to God the Father for the son’s sake, and had not prayed to the savior himself; for “Jesus” signifies savior. [4] They were then requested that from thinking of the Lord’s Divine human, they should say, “Divine human”; but none of the clergy that were present could do so, though some of the laity could, wherefore the matter was taken into serious discussion; and then:"

The Father hath given the son power over all flesh (John 17:2). All things are delivered unto me by the Father (Matt. 11:27). All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth (Matt. 28:18). And they were directed to keep in the thought, that Christ, both as to his Divine and as to his human, is the God of heaven and earth, and thus to pronounce “Divine human.” But still they could not; and they said that they indeed retained from those passages something of the thought of it from their understanding concerning it, but not acknowledgment, and that on its account they were not able. [5] 2. Afterwards was read to them out of Luke (1:32, 34, 35), that the Lord as to the human was the son of Jehovah God, and that everywhere in the Word he is called, as to the human, “the son of God,” and also “the only-begotten,” and they were asked to hold this in the thought; and likewise that the only-begotten son of God born in the world cannot but be God, as the Father is God, and to utter the words, “Divine human.” But they said, “We cannot, by reason that our spiritual thought, which is interior, does not admit into the thought which is next to the speech any other than similar ideas”; and that thence they could perceive, that it is not permitted them to divide their thoughts, as it was in the natural world. [6] 3. Then were read to them these words of the Lord to Philip: Philip said, Lord, show us the Father, and the Lord said, he who seeth me seeth the Father; believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? (John 14:8–11). And in another place: The Father and he are one (John 10:30, and elsewhere)."

The reason was, because the ideas of thought, which flow from acknowledgment, make one with words uttered by the tongue, with those who are in the spiritual world; and where such ideas do not exist, there are no words, for the ideas become words in speaking. [7] 4. Moreover there was read to them from the doctrine of the church received throughout the whole world, the following passage, taken from the Athanasian Creed: “That the Divine and human in the Lord are not two but one, yea, one person, united altogether like soul and body”; and it was said to them, “From this you may possibly have an idea from the acknowledgment that the Lord’s human is Divine, because his soul is Divine, for it is from the doctrine of your church, acknowledged by you when in the world. Moreover the soul is the essence itself, and the body is its form, and the essence and form make one, like being and existing, and like the efficient cause of the effect, and the effect itself.” They retained that idea, and wished to utter “Divine human”; but they could not; for their interior idea concerning the Lord’s human exterminated and expunged this new supplemental idea, as they called it. [8] 5. Again there was read to them this passage from John: The Word was with God, and God was the Word; and the Word became flesh (John. 1:1, 14). And the following from Paul: In Jesus Christ dwelleth all the fullness of the divinity bodily (Col. 2:9). And they were told to think firmly that God, who was the Word, was made flesh, and that all the Divine dwells in him bodily, and perhaps then they might be able to pronounce “Divine human.”"

At length it was said to them: you know that the Lord said: Abide in me, and I in you, he who abideth in me, and I in him, the same beareth much fruit, for without me ye can do nothing (John 15:4–5). And as some of the English clergy were present, there was read to them this passage out of one of their exhortations before the holy communion, “For when we spiritually eat the flesh of Christ, and drink the blood, then we dwell in Christ, and Christ in us.” “If now you will but think that this cannot take place, except the Lord’s human be Divine, you may pronounce ‘Divine human,’ from an acknowledgment in thought.” But still they could not; so deeply was the idea impressed upon them that the Lord’s Divine was one thing and his human another, and that his Divine was like the Divine of the Father, and his human like the human of another man. But it was said to them, “How can you think thus? Is it possible for a rational mind ever to think that God is three, and the Lord two?” [10] 7. Afterwards they turned to the Lutherans, saying that the Augustan confession and Luther taught that the son of God and the son of man in Christ are one person, and that he even as to the human nature, is the true, omnipotent, and eternal God, and that as to this nature also, being present at the right hand of God almighty, he governs all things in the heavens and on earth, fills all things, is with us, and dwells and operates in us; and that there is no distinction of adoration, because by the nature which is seen, the divinity which is not seen is adored, thus that in Christ God is man and man is God. On hearing this, they said, “Is it so?” And they looked round, and presently they said, “This is what we did not know before; therefore we are not able.” But one and another said, “We have read it and written it, but yet when we thought of it"

Then a certain monk rose up and said that he could think of the Divine human, concerning the most holy virgin Mary, the God- bearer, and also of the saint of his monastery. And another monk came, and said, “From my idea of thought, I could rather call his holiness, the pope, the Divine human, than Christ”; but then some other monks pulled him back, and said, “Shame on you.” [12] After this heaven was seen open, and there were seen tongues, as little flames, descending and flowing in with some; and they then celebrated the Divine human of the Lord, saying, “Remove the idea of three Gods, and believe that in the Lord dwells all the fullness of divinity bodily, and that the Father and he are one, as the soul and body are one, and that God is not wind, or ether, but that he is man, and then you will be conjoined with heaven, and thereby have power from the Lord to pronounce the name of ‘Jesus,’ and say ‘Divine human.’”"

Verse 15. “And the kings of the earth, and the great ones, and the rich, and the rulers of thousands, and the mighty, and every servant, and every freeman” signifies those who, before separation, were in the understanding of truth and good, in the science of the knowledges thereof, in erudition, either from others or from themselves, and yet not in a life according to them (n. 337). “Hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains” signifies that they were now in evils and in falsities of evil (n. 338).

A “chariot” signifies doctrine from the Word, and a “horseman,” one that is wise by means of it. The same is signified by: The four chariots which came out from between the mountains of brass, and by the four horses harnessed in them, which were red, black, white, and speckled, which are also called the four spirits, and are said to have gone forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth (Zech. 6:1–8, 15).

Thou shalt set him king over Israel whom Jehovah shall choose; but only he shall not multiply horses to himself, lest he bring back the people into Egypt to multiply horses (Deut. 17:15–16).

To fight against falsities and evils is also to fight against the hells, because evils and falsities are from thence, therefore this also is signified. [2] That “a bow,” in the Word signifies doctrine combating, in both senses, may appear from these passages: The arrows of Jehovah are sharp, and all his bows bent, the hoofs of his horses shall be counted like flints (Isa. 5:28). The Lord bent his bow like an enemy (Lam. 2:4). Thou, O Jehovah, ridest upon thy horses, thy bow shall be made naked (Hab. 3:8–9). He gave the nations before him and made him rule over kings. He gave them as dust to his sword, and as stubble to his bow (Isa. 41:2). In these places “a bow,” because it is applied to Jehovah or the Lord signifies the Word, from which the Lord fights with man against evils and falsities. I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem, and the bow of war shall be cut off; and he shall speak peace to the nations (Zech. 9:10). They bend their tongue, their bow is a lie, and not the truth (Jer. 9:3). Behold the wicked bend their bow, they make ready the arrows upon the string, to shoot in the darkness the upright in heart (Ps. 11:2).

This is concerning the Lord: Who is this that cometh from Edom, red as to his garment, and his garment as of him that treadeth in the winepress (Isa. 63:1–2).

If your sins were as scarlet, they shall be white as snow; if they were red as purple, they shall be as wool (Isa. 1:18).

But in the spiritual world there exists blackness from a twofold origin, one from the absence of flaming light, which light is with those who are in the Lord’s celestial kingdom, and the other from the absence of bright light, which is the light with those who are in the Lord’s spiritual kingdom; the latter blackness has the same signification as “darkness,” but the former as “thick darkness.” There is a difference between these two kinds of blackness, the one is abominable, the other not so much so; it is the same with the falsities which they signify. They who appear in the abominable kind of blackness are called devils, such holding truth in abomination as horned owls do the light of the sun. But they appear in that kind of blackness, which is not abominable, who are called satans; these do not abominate truth, but are averse to it; the latter may therefore be compared to owls, and the former to horned owls. That “black,” in the Word is spoken of falsity, may appear from these passages: Her Nazarites were whiter than snow, their form is darkened more than blackness (Lam. 4:7–8). The day shall grow black over the prophets (Micah 3:6). In the day when thou goest down into hell, I will make Lebanon black over thee (Ezek. 31:15). The sun became black as sackcloth of hair (Rev. 6:12)."

The reason why “the third animal” showed “a black horse,” was, because it had a face like a man, by which is signified the Divine truth of the Word as to wisdom (n. 243), therefore this animal showed that there was no longer any truth of wisdom with those who were the third in order. 313. And he that sat upon him had a pair of balances in his hand signifies the estimation of good and truth, of what kind it was with these. By “the pair of balances in his hand,” is signified the estimation of truth and good; for all measures and weights, in the Word signify the estimation of the thing treated of. That measures and weights signify such things is manifest from these words in Daniel: There appeared a writing before Belshazzar the king of Babylon, when he was drinking wine from the vessels of gold and silver taken out of the temple of Jerusalem, Mene, mene, thekel, perizin; that is, numbered, numbered, weighed, divided; the interpretation of which is this: mene, God hath numbered thy kingdom, and finished it; thekel, thou art weighed in the balance, and found wanting; perez, the kingdom is divided, and given to the Mede and the Persian (Dan. 5:1–2, 25–28). By “drinking from the gold and silver vessels of the temple of Jerusalem,” and at the same time worshiping other gods signifies the profanation of good and truth; as also by “Babylon.” By “mene,” or to number, is signified to know his quality as to truth; by “thekel,” or to weigh, is signified to know his quality as to good; by “perez,” or to divide, is signified to disperse. That the quality of truth and good is signified by measures and by balances in the Word is manifest in Isaiah: Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and hath meted out the heavens with the span, and hath embraced the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in balances (Isa. 40:12).

Verse 6. And I heard a voice in the midst of the four animals, saying signifies the Divine guard of the Word by the Lord. That “the four animals” or cherubs signify the Word from firsts to ultimates, and guards lest its interior truths and goods should be violated, may be seen above (n. 239); and because these guards are from the Lord, the voice was therefore heard in the midst of the four animals. By “in the midst” of them is meant the Word as to its internal spiritual sense, which the Lord guards. That a guard is signified is manifest from the things that it said: A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and hurt not the oil and the wine (Rev. 6:6); by which is signified that because the estimation of good and truth is so trifling that it is scarcely anything, it must be provided that the holy goods and truths, which lie hid interiorly in the Word, should not be violated and profaned; and this is provided by the Lord by this means, that they at length do not know any good, and thence neither any truth, but mere evil and falsity: for they who know goods and truths can violate, yea, they can profane them, but not so they who do not know them. That such is the operation of the Divine providence in guarding the Word, may be seen in Angelic Wisdom concerning Divine Providence (n. 221–233, n. 257, the end; n. 258, the beginning). 315. A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny signifies because the estimation of good and truth is so small as to be scarcely anything. These are signified because by “a measure” [choenix] which was the measure and the quantity measured is signified quality, as above (n. 314); by “wheat” and “barley” is signified good and truth; and by a penny [denarius] which is a very small coin, that they are held in little or no estimation. It is said “three” measures of barley, because “three” signifies all, and is predicated of truths (n. 515). The reason why “wheat” and “barley” signify good and truth, here the good and"

Be ye ashamed, O ye husbandmen; howl, O ye vine dressers, for the wheat and the barley; because the harvest of the field is perished (Joel1:10–12). [2] All these things signify such things as are of the church. That “wheat” and “barley” signify the good and truth of the church, may be seen from these passages: John saith concerning Jesus, that he will gather the wheat into the barn, and burn up the chaff with fire (Matt. 3:11–12). Jesus said, Let the tares and the wheat grow together, and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares to burn, but gather the wheat into my barn (Matt. 13:24–30). I have heard the consummation and decision from Jehovah God; he layeth up the measured wheat, and the appointed barley; for his God doth instruct him to judgment, and doth teach him (Isa. 28:22, 25–26). Jehovah shall lead thee to a land of wheat and barley (Deut. 8:7–8). “A land of wheat and barley” here is the land of Canaan, by which the church is signified. They shall come and sing in the height of Zion, and shall flow together to the goodness of Jehovah, for wheat and must (Jer. 31:12).

Which things were done by those prophets, that they might represent the falsifications of truth in the church, for “barley” signifies truths, and “barley mixed with dung” truths falsified and profaned; “a woman an adulteress” also signifies truth falsified (n. 134). 316. And hurt not the oil and the wine signifies that it is provided by the Lord that the holy goods and truths, which lie interiorly concealed in the Word, shall not be violated and profaned. “Oil” signifies the good of love, and “wine” truth from that good, therefore “oil” signifies holy good, and “wine” holy truth; “hurt them not” signifies that it is provided by the Lord that they shall not be violated and profaned; for this was heard “from the midst of the four animals,” thus from the Lord (n. 314); what is said by the Lord, the same is also provided for by him; that it is provided, may be seen above (n. 314, 255). That “oil” signifies the good of love, will be seen below (n. 778–779); but that “wine” signifies truth from that good is evident from the following passages: Everyone that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no silver, come ye, buy and eat, yea come, buy wine and milk without silver (Isa. 55:1). And it shall come to pass in that day, that the mountains shall drop down must, and the hills shall flow with milk (Joel 3:18; Amos 9:13–14).

He washeth his garments in wine and his covering in the blood of grapes; his eyes are red from wine (Gen. 49:11–12). These things are concerning the Lord; “wine” signifies Divine truth. This is the reason why the holy supper was instituted by the Lord, in which the bread signifies the Lord as to the Divine good, and the wine the Lord as to the Divine truth, and with the recipients the bread signifies holy good, and the wine, holy truth, from the Lord; therefore he said: I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this product of the vine, until the day when I shall drink it with you in my Father’s kingdom (Matt. 16:29; Luke 22:18). Because “bread and wine” had this signification, therefore, also: Melchizedek, going to meet Abram, brought forth bread and wine, and he was the priest of the most high God, and he blessed Abram (Gen. 14:18–19). [3] Similar is the signification of the meal offering and drink offering, in the sacrifices, concerning which see Exodus 29:40; Leviticus 23:12, 13, 18, 19; Numbers 15:2–15; 28:6, 7, 18, to the end; 29:1–7, and the following verses. The meal offering was of fine flour of wheat, and was therefore instead of bread, and the drink offering was of wine. From which it may appear what is signified by these words of the Lord: Neither do men put new wine into old bottles, but they put new wine into new bottles, and both are preserved (Matt. 9:17; Luke 5:37). “New wine” is the Divine truth of the New Testament, thus of the new church, and “old wine” is the Divine truth of the Old"

Similar is the signification of these words of the Lord at the marriage in Cana of Galilee: Every man at first setteth forth good wine, and when men have had enough, the worse; thou hast kept the good wine until now (John 2:1–10). [4] The like is also signified by “wine” in the Lord’s parable of the man that was wounded by robbers, that: The Samaritan poured oil and wine into his wounds (Luke 10:33–34). For by him that was “wounded by robbers,” are meant they who are spiritually wounded by the Jews by evils and falsities, to whom the Samaritan gave assistance “by pouring in oil and wine” into his wounds, that is, by teaching good and truth, and, so far as he was able, by healing. Holy truth is also signified by “must” and “wine” in other parts of the Word (as in Isaiah 1:21, 22; 25:6; 36:17; Hosea 7:4, 5, 14; 14:6–8; Amos 2:8; Zechariah 9:15, 17; Psalms 104:14, 15). Hence it is that “a vineyard,” in the Word signifies a church that is in truths from the Lord. [5] That “wine” signifies holy truth, may also appear from its opposite sense, in which it signifies truth falsified and profaned; as in these passages: Whoredom, and wine, and must, occupy the heart. Their wine has failed, they have committed whoredom continually (Hos. 4:11, 17–18). “Whoredom” signifies the falsification of truth, as do “wine and must” here. In the hand of Jehovah is a cup, and he hath mixed it with wine; he hath filled it with mixture, and poureth it out, and the dregs of it all the wicked of the earth suck out and drink (Ps. 75:8).

Babylon hath made all nations drink of the wine of her whoredom (Rev. 18:3). Great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fury of the anger of God (Rev. 16:19). The inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her whoredom (Rev. 17:1–2).

Nothing else is meant than the holy truth of the Word and of the church profaned. Wherefore the writing then appeared upon the wall, and the king was slain that night (verses 25, 30). “Wine” signifies truth falsified also in Isaiah 5:11, 12, 21, 22; 28:1, 3, 7; 29:9; 56:11, 12; Jeremiah 13:12; 23:9, 10. The same is signified by the drink offering which they offered to idols (Isaiah 65:11; 57:6; Jeremiah 7:18; 44:17–19; Ezekiel 20:28; Deuteronomy 32:38). That “wine” signifies holy truth and, in the opposite sense, truth profaned is from correspondence; for the angels, who perceive all things spiritually, understand nothing else when man reads “wine” in the Word; such a correspondence is there between the natural thoughts of men and the spiritual thoughts of angels. It is similar with the wine in the holy supper, and hence it is, that introduction into heaven is effected by the holy supper (n. 224, at the end). 317. Verse 7.

Verse 8. And I saw, and behold, a pale horse signifies the understanding of the Word destroyed both as to good and as to truth. “A horse” signifies the understanding of the Word (n. 298), and “pale” signifies no vitality. In the Word, this want of vitality is predicated of those who are not in goods of life from truths of doctrine; for the Word, in the sense of the letter, is not understood without doctrine, and doctrine is not perceived without a life according to it; the reason is because a life according to doctrine which is from the Word, opens the spiritual mind, when light flows into it from heaven and enlightens and gives to perceive. That this is the case, he does not know who knows truths of doctrine, and yet does not live according to them. The reason why “the fourth animal” showed “a pale horse,” was, because that animal was like “a flying eagle,” and by it was signified the Divine truth of the Word as to knowledges and understanding therefrom (n. 244). Therefore he showed that with those who were now seen there were no knowledges of good and truth from the Word, nor any understanding of them, and such in the spiritual world appear pale, like those who are without life. 321.

The cords of death encompassed me; the cords of hell encompassed me; the snares of death prevented me (Ps. 18:4–5; 116:3). Like sheep they are laid in hell; death shall feed on them, hell is their habitation, but God will redeem my soul from the hand of hell (Ps. 49:14–15). I have the keys of hell and death (Rev. 1:18). 322. And power was given them over the fourth part of the earth to kill signifies the destruction of all the good of the church. Since by “death” is meant the extinction of man’s spiritual life, and by “hell” damnation, it follows that “to kill” here means to destroy the life of man’s soul; the life of the soul is spiritual life; “a fourth part of the earth” signifies all the good of the church; “the earth” is the church (n. 285). That “a fourth part” is all good, cannot be known by anyone, unless he knows what numbers in the Word signify. The numbers “two” and “four” in the Word, are predicated of goods, and signify them; and the numbers “three” and “six” are predicated of truths, and signify them; thus “a fourth part,” or simply “a fourth” signifies all good, and “a third part,” or simply “a third” signifies all truth; therefore “to kill a fourth part of the earth,” here signifies to destroy all the good of the church. That “power was not given to him that sat upon the pale horse to kill a fourth part of the habitable earth,” is evident. [2] Besides, “four” in the Word signifies the conjunction of good and truth.

Here, therefore, by “sword,” because the destruction of all the goods in the church is treated of, are signified falsities of doctrine. That “hunger” signifies evils of life, will be confirmed below. The reason why “death” signifies the love of man’s proprium is, because “death” signifies the extinction of spiritual life, and thence natural life separated from spiritual life (as above, n. 321), and this life is the life of the love of man’s proprium; for from it man loves nothing but himself and the world, and thence also he loves all kinds of evils, which, from the love of that life, are delightful to him. That “beasts of the earth” signify lusts from that love, will be seen below (n. 567). Here something shall be said concerning the signification of “hunger.” (1) “Hunger” signifies deprivation and rejection of the knowledges of truth and good arising from evils of life.

[3] That by “the slain” are meant they who are rejected, reproached and hated by the evil in the world of spirits, and who could be seduced, and also who desire to know truths, but cannot, by reason of falsities in the church, may appear from these passages: Jehovah God saith, Feed the sheep of the slaughter, whose possessors slay them; and I will feed the sheep of slaughter, on account of you, O poor of the flock (Zech. 11:4–5, 7). We are killed all the day long; we are counted as sheep for the slaughter; O Jehovah forsake us not (Ps. 44:22–23). Jacob shall cause them which are to come to take root, or is he slain according to the slaughter of them that were slain by him? (Isa. 27:6–7). For I have heard the voice of the daughter of Zion, woe is me, now; my soul is wearied by the slayers (Jer. 4:31). They shall deliver you into affliction, and shall kill you, and ye shall be hated for my name’s sake (Matt. 24:9; John 16:2–3)."

[4] The evil in the world of spirits continually desire to kill; but because there they cannot do this as to the body, they continually desire to do it as to the soul; and since they are not able to do this, they burn with such hatred against them, that nothing delights them more than to do evil to them. This is the reason why they are guarded by the Lord, and when the evil are cast into hell, which takes place after the last judgment, they are led forth from their guards; but see the explanation of chapter 20, n. 846, which treats of this subject. That “to kill” in the Word signifies to destroy souls, which is to kill spiritually, is evident from many passages there, as also from the following: Isaiah 14:19–21; 26:21; Jeremiah 25:33; Lamentations 2:21; Ezekiel 9:1, 6; Revelation 18:24. 326. Verse 10. And they cried with a great voice signifies grief of heart, as is evident from what now follows. 327. Saying, How long, O Lord,5 dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth? signifies by reason that the last judgment is delayed, and they who offer violence to the Word and to the Lord’s Divine human are not removed. “How long, O Lord, dost thou not judge” signifies why is the last judgment delayed? “And avenge our blood” signifies why in justice are they not condemned, who have offered them violence for acknowledging the Lord’s Divine human, and for living according to the truths of his Word? By “blood” is signified violence offered to them (n. 379); by “them that dwell on the earth,” are meant the evil in the world of spirits, from whom they were guarded that they might not be hurt. 328. Verse 11. And white robes were given unto each of them signifies that there was given them a communication and conjunction with the angels who were in Divine truths. ”Garments” signify truths (n. 166), and “white garments” genuine truths (n. 212). “Garments” have this signification, because all in the heavens are clothed according to the truths with them; and"

Therefore when conjunction is granted, they immediately appear clothed in a similar manner; hence it is, that by “white robes were given to each of them,” is signified that communication and conjunction was given them with angels who were in Divine truths. “Robes,” “mantles,” and “cloaks” signify truths in general, because they are general coverings. He who knows this signification of these things may know the arcana which are contained in the following passages: That Elijah, when he found Elisha, cast his mantle upon him. (1 Kings 19:19). That Elijah by his mantle divided the waters of Jordan (2 Kings 2:8). And in like manner Elisha (2 Kings 2:14). That the mantle fell from Elijah when he was taken up, and Elisha took it up (2 Kings 2:12–13). For by Elijah and Elisha the Lord was represented as to the Word, and therefore their “mantle” signified the Divine truth of the Word in general. As also was signified by: The robe of Aaron’s ephod, at the border of which there were pomegranates of blue and purple, and bells of gold (Exod. 28:31–35). That it signifies the Divine truth in general may be seen in Arcana Coelestia, published at London (n. 9825). “Cloaks” and “mantles” have a similar signification in the following passages: All the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones and cast away their cloaks (Ezek. 26:16). The scribes and Pharisees make broad the borders of their cloaks, that they may be seen of men (Matt. 23:5).

That this is the signification, appears from what has been said above. Similar is the signification of this passage in Isaiah: Thy dead shall live; awake and shout, ye that dwell in the dust, come, my people, enter into thy chambers, and shut the door after thee; hide thyself as it were for a little moment, until the anger be passed by.

Secondly, that as long as they were in conjunction with the ultimate heaven, so long the internals of their will and their love were closed, for which reason they did not appear evil before others; but when they were separated from the ultimate heaven, then their interiors were disclosed, and found to be totally in opposition to their exteriors, from which they dissembled and feigned that they were angels of heaven, and that the places they inhabited were heavens.

And, behold, there was a great earthquake signifies the state of the church with these altogether changed, and terror. “Earthquakes” signify changes of state in the church, because “the earth” signifies the church (n. 285); and because in the spiritual world, when the state of the church is perverted anywhere, and there is a change, there is an earthquake, and as this is a prelude to their destruction, they are in terror. For the earths in the spiritual world are in appearance like the earths in the natural world (n. 260); but as the earths there, like all other things in that world, are from a spiritual origin, therefore changes occur according to the state of the church among the inhabitants, and when the state of the church is perverted, they quake and tremble, yea, sink down and are moved out of their place. That this was the case, when the last judgment was at hand and accomplished, may be seen in the small work Last Judgment. Hence it may appear what is meant by “earthquakes,” “shakings,” and “commotions” of the earth, in the following passages: There shall be pestilences, famines, and earthquakes in diverse places (Matt. 24:7; Mark 13:8; Luke 21:11). This is said of the last judgment: In the fire of indignation have I spoken; surely in that day there shall be a great earthquake, and every man upon the face of the earth shall tremble, and the mountains shall be overturned (Ezek. 38:19–20). There was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth (Rev. 16:18).

And the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood signifies the adulteration of all the good of love in them, and the falsification of all the truth of faith. That “the sun” signifies the Lord as to Divine love, and thence the good of love from him; and in the opposite sense, the denial of the Lord’s divinity, and thence the adulteration of the good of love, may be seen above (n. 53). And as “the sun” signifies the good of love, “the moon” therefore signifies the truth of faith; for the sun is red from fire, and the moon is white from the light of the sun; and fire signifies the good of love, and light, the truth from that good. Concerning the moon, see also the passages adduced above (n. 53). It is said, “the sun became black as sackcloth of hair,” because adulterated good in itself is evil, and evil is black; and the reason why it is said “the moon became as blood” is because “blood” signifies Divine truth, and in the opposite sense, Divine truth falsified, as may be seen below (n. 379, 684). Nearly the same is said of the sun and moon in Joel: The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and terrible day of Jehovah cometh (Joel 2:31). 333. Verse 13.

Even as a fig tree casteth her unripe figs, when shaken by a great wind signifies by reasonings of the natural man separated from the spiritual. It is said to have this signification, when yet it is a comparison, because all comparisons in the Word are also correspondences, and in the spiritual sense they cohere with the subject treated of, as in the present instance; for “a fig,” from correspondence signifies the natural good of man conjoined with his spiritual good, but here, in the opposite sense, the natural good of man separated from his spiritual good, which is not good; and as the natural man, when separated from the spiritual, perverts by reasonings the knowledges of good and truth, which are signified by the stars, it follows that this is signified by “a fig tree shaken by a great wind.” That “wind” and “storm” signify reasoning is evident from many passages in the Word, but it is not necessary to adduce them here, because it is a comparison. The reason why “a fig tree” signifies the natural good of man is because every tree signifies something of the church in man, therefore also man with respect thereto. In confirmation are these passages: All the host of heaven shall fall down, as a leaf falleth from the vine, and as it falleth from the fig tree (Isa. 34:4). I will consume them, there shall be no grapes on the vine, nor figs on the fig tree, and the leaf shall fall (Jer. 8:13). All thy bulwarks shall be like fig trees with the first fruits; if they be shaken, they shall even fall upon the mouth of the eater (Nahum 3:12; besides other places; as Jer. 24:2–3, 5, 8; Isa. 38:21; Jer. 29:17–18; Hos. 2:12; 9:10; Joel 1:7, 12; Zech. 3:10; Matt. 21:18–21; 24:32–33; Mark 11:12–14, 20–24; Luke 6:44; 13:6–9).

That this is the case, may be seen in Angelic Wisdom concerning Divine Love and Wisdom, Chapter 5. By virtue of this faculty of the understanding, the evil who are here treated of, could be in consociation with the angels of the ultimate heaven; but when these were separated from the former, their heaven departed as “a book rolled together.” By “a book rolled together” is meant parchment, rolled up, because their books were parchments, and the comparison is made with a book, because the book is the Word (n. 256); therefore when it is rolled up like a parchment, nothing that it contains is apparent, and it is as though it were not. On this account the like is said in Isaiah: And all the host of heaven shall waste away, and the heavens shall be rolled together as a book, and shall fall down as the leaf falleth from the fig tree (Isa. 34:4). “Hosts” are the goods and truths of the church from the Word (n. 447). From these things it may appear, that by “heaven departing as a book rolled together,” is signified separation from heaven, and conjunction with hell. That separation from heaven is conjunction with hell is evident. 336. And every mountain and island were moved out of their places signifies that all the good of love and truth of faith receded. That this is the signification of these words no one can see without the spiritual sense. They have this signification, however, because by “mountains” are meant those who are in the good of love, because the angels dwell upon mountains; such as are in love to the Lord dwelling on high mountains, and such as are in love towards their neighbor dwelling on lower ones; wherefore by “every mountain” is signified every good of love. By “islands” are meant those who are more remote from the worship of God, see above (n. 34); here"

In the consummation of the age; then let them which be in Judea flee into the mountains (Matt. 24:16). Thy justice, O Jehovah, is like the mountains of God (Ps. 36:6).

That “the day of the Lord’s anger” signifies the last judgment is evident from the following passages: Before the fierce anger of Jehovah come upon you, before the day of Jehovah’s anger come upon you, it may be ye shall be hid in the day of Jehovah’s anger (Zeph. 2:2–3). Behold the day of Jehovah cometh, cruel both with indignation and wrath of anger (Isa. 13:9, 13). The great day of Jehovah is near, a day of wrath, a day of straitness and distress, a day of darkness and thick darkness (Zeph. 1:14–15). Thy anger is come, and the time of the dead to be judged, and to give reward unto thy servants, and to destroy them that destroy the earth (Rev. 11:18). Kiss the son, lest he be angry and ye perish in the way, because his anger is kindled quickly; happy are all they that trust in him (Ps. 2:12). 341. To the above I will add this relation. I saw some of the English clergy assembled, to the number of six hundred, who prayed to the Lord that they might be permitted to ascend to a society of the higher heaven; which being granted them, they ascended. And when they entered, they saw their king, the present king’s grandfather,8 and they were glad; he went up to two bishops that were among them, whom he had known in the world, and entering into discourse with them, asked them, “How came you here?” They replied that they had made supplication to the Lord and it was granted them. He said to them, “Why to the Lord, and not to God the Father?” And they answered, that they were so instructed below. And he said, “Did I not sometimes tell you in the world, that the Lord ought to be approached, and also that charity is primary? What reply did you then make concerning the Lord?” And it was given them to recollect that they had made answer that when the Father is approached, the son also is approached. But the angels who were about the king said, “You are mistaken, you did not think so, nor is the Lord approached, when God the Father is"

Who approaches a man’s soul, and thus his body? When a man is approached as to his body, which is seen, is not his soul also approached, which is not seen?” To this they were silent. And the king went up to the two bishops, with two gifts in his hand, saying, “These are gifts from heaven.” They were celestial forms of gold which he wished to present to them, when a dusky cloud covered them, and separated them. And they descended by the way that they had come up; and they wrote these things in a book. [2] The rest of the English clergy, who had heard that their companions had been permitted to ascend to the higher heaven, assembled at the foot of the mountain, where they waited for their return. On their return they saluted their brethren, and related what had happened to them in heaven, and that the king had presented the bishops with two celestial forms of gold, most beautiful to behold; but that they fell out of their hands. They then went out of the public place into a grove, which was near, and discoursed among themselves, looking about to see if anyone heard them; but nevertheless they were heard. Their discourse was about unanimity and concord, and then about supremacy and dominion. The bishops spoke, and the rest assented. And on a sudden, to my surprise, they no longer appeared as many, but as one great figure whose face was like the face of a lion, having on his head a turreted miter, on which was a crown: and he spoke in a lofty tone, and walked proudly; and, looking behind, he said, “Who else has a right to supremacy but me?” The king looked down from heaven and saw them, first all as one, and afterwards as several unanimous; but most of them, as he said, in a secular dress."

THE EXPLANATION 342. Verse 1. Afterwards I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth signifies the entire heaven now in the effort to execute the last judgment on those who were in the world of spirits. Many things now follow concerning the state of the spiritual world just before the last judgment, which no one could know but by revelation from the Lord. And since it has been granted me to see in what manner the last judgment was executed, and also the changes which preceded it, and the arrangements which followed; I am thereby enabled to relate the signification of all the particulars contained in this and the following chapters. [2] By “the four angels” is here signified the entire heaven; by “the four corners of the earth” is signified the entire world of spirits, which is in the midst between heaven and hell; for the last judgment was executed on those who were in the world of spirits, but not on anyone in heaven, nor anyone in hell. The reason why “the angels” signify heaven is because “an angel,” in the highest sense, means the Lord as to the Divine human (n. 344); and as"

[3] “The four angels” here signify the entire heaven, because they were seen “standing on the four corners of the earth,” and by the “four corners” are signified the four quarters. The reason why the above words signify the effort of the entire heaven to execute the last judgment is because the Lord, when the judgment was at hand, caused the heavens to draw near over the world of spirits, and by this approach of the heavens, such a change of state in the interiors of the minds of those who were below, was effected, that they saw nothing but terrors before their eyes. [4] That “corners” signify quarters, and thence “the four corners” all quarters, may appear from the following passages: Ye shall measure without the city, the corner towards the east, the corner towards the south, the corner towards the west, and the corner towards the north (Num. 35:5). Thou shalt make the boards for the habitation for the corner of the south, and for the corner of the north (Exod. 26:18, 20, 23). And a court for the corner of the south, for the corner of the north, for the corner of the west, and for the corner of the east (Exod. 27:9, 11–13). The four quarters are also called “the four corners” frequently in Ezekiel, as in chapter 47:8–20; 48. [5] Because “corners” signify quarters, therefore they also signify all things, as all things relating to heaven or hell, or of good or truth, as is plain from these passages: Satan shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth (Rev. 20:8). I have cut off the nations, and their corners are devastated (Zeph. 3:6)."

Holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree signifies a withholding and restraining by the Lord of a nearer and thence more powerful influx into the lower parts, where the good were conjoined with the evil. It is to be known that the last judgment takes place when the evil are multiplied below the heavens in the world of spirits, to such a degree that the angels in the heavens cannot subsist in their state of love and wisdom; for in this case they have no support and no foundation. And as this is caused by the multiplication of the evil below, therefore the Lord, in order to preserve their state, flows in with his Divine more and more strongly, and this continues until they can no longer be preserved by any influx, without a separation of the evil below from the good."

This is also what is signified in the foregoing chapter by these words: They said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth upon the throne, and from the anger of the lamb; for the great day of his anger is come; and who shall be able to stand (Rev. 6:16–17).

By “the four winds” is signified the influx of the heavens; by “the earth, the sea, and every tree” are signified all lower things and the things that are there; by “the earth and sea,” all lower things; and by “every tree,” all things there. That “wind” signifies influx, properly the influx of truth into the understanding, may appear from the following passages: Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Come from the four winds, O spirit, and breathe into these slain, that they may live (Ezek. 37:9–10). There were seen four chariots, to which there were four horses, these are the four winds of the heavens (Zech. 6:1, 5). Ye must be born again. The wind bloweth where it willeth, and thou knowest not whence it cometh, and whither it goeth (John 3:7–8). The maker of the earth prepareth the world by his wisdom, he bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures (Jer. 10:12–13; 51:15–16; Ps.135:7). Jehovah causeth his wind to blow, and the waters flow. He announceth his word, his statutes and judgments (Ps. 147:17–19). Jehovah praiseth the stormy wind doing his Word (Ps. 148:8). Jehovah maketh his angels winds (Ps. 104:3–4). Jehovah was carried upon the wings of the wind (Ps. 18:10; 104:3). The wings of the wind are Divine truths which flow in; therefore the Lord is called:"

[3] “The Holy Spirit” is the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord, the influx of which into the disciples was represented, and thus signified by “he breathed upon them.” That “wind” and respiration signify the influx of Divine truth into the understanding is from the correspondence of the lungs with the understanding, on which subject see Angelic Wisdom concerning Divine Love and Wisdom (n. 371–429). As, therefore, a nearer and stronger Divine influx through the heavens disperses the truths with the evil, therefore “wind” signifies the dispersion of the truth with them; and thence their conjunction with hell, and destruction; as may be seen from these passages: And upon Elam I will bring the four winds from the four ends of the heavens, and will disperse them (Jer. 49:36). Thou shalt disperse them, that the wind may carry them away, and the storm dissipate them (Isa. 41:16). The breath of Jehovah, like a stream of brimstone, doth kindle them (Isa. 30:33). The contrivers of iniquity perish by the blast of God, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed (Job 4:8–9).

He saith that the wind of the storm shall blow. God maketh the storm to be calm, that its waves might be still (Ps. 107:25, 29). [4] Hence it may appear what is the signification of these words in their spiritual sense: Jesus in the ship rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Be still, and it was quiet (Mark 4:39–40; Luke 8:23–24). By “the sea” is here signified hell, and by “the wind” influx thence. Nor is anything but strong influx signified by “the east wind” (Ezek. 17:10; Jer. 18:17; Ezek. 19:12; Hosea 13:15; Psalm 48:7). Nor by the same “wind which dried up the Red Sea” (Exod. 14:21); concerning which it is thus written by Moses: And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were heaped up, thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them (Exod. 15:8, 10). From what has been said, it may now be seen, that by “holding the four winds that the wind should not blow on the earth” is signified to withhold and prevent a nearer and stronger influx into the lower parts. 344. Verse 2.

The angel who redeemed me from all evil bless them (Gen. 48:16). The Lord whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, and the angel of the covenant, whom ye desire (Mal. 3:1). Behold, I send an angel before thee to keep thee in the way, beware of his face, for my name is in the midst of him (Exod. 23:20–23). “Angel” and “sent” in the Hebrew language, are expressed by one word; hence it is that the Lord so often calls himself “sent by the Father,” by which is meant the Divine human. But “an angel,” in a relative sense is everyone who receives the Lord, both in heaven and in the world. 345. Having the seal of the living God signifies who alone knows all and each, and can distinguish and separate them one from another. Since they were sealed on their foreheads with a seal, therefore by “having the seal of the living God,” as spoken of the Lord is meant to know all and each, and to be able to distinguish and separate the servants of God from those who are not servants of God. 346.

That this is the signification of these words is evident from the explanation above (n. 343). In the sense of the letter it was the four angels that withheld influx, but, in the spiritual sense, it was the Lord. “Not to hurt the earth, the sea, nor the trees” signifies that they should not operate by a vehement, but by a moderate, influx.

Till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads signifies before they are separated who are in truths from good from the Lord, thus who are interiorly good. By “sealing them in their foreheads,” is not meant to seal them there, but to distinguish and separate those who are in the good of love from the Lord; for “the forehead” signifies the good of love. That they who are in truths from good from the Lord are meant, because these are signified by “the servants of God” (n. 3). The reason why “the forehead” signifies the good of love is because the face is the image of man’s affections, and the forehead is the highest part of the face; the cerebrum, from which is the origin of all things of man’s life, being immediately under the forehead. As “the forehead” signifies the love, good love in the good, and evil love in the evil, therefore by “sealing them on their foreheads,” is signified to distinguish and separate one from another according to the love. Similar is the signification of this passage in Ezekiel: Go through the midst of Jerusalem, and seal a seal upon the foreheads of the men that sigh over the abominations (Ezek. 9:4–6). [2] As “the forehead” signifies love, therefore concerning the plate of gold on the mitre of Aaron, on which was engraven holiness to Jehovah, it is written: That it should be over against the face of his mitre, that it might be over the forehead of Aaron, and that it should be upon the forehead of Aaron continually, that they may be in good favor before Jehovah (Exod. 28:36–38). And moreover it was commanded: That these words, Thou shalt love God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, were to be upon the hand and upon the forehead (Deut. 6:5, 8; 11:18). That they should have the name of the Father written on their foreheads (Rev. 14:1)."

And also the name of Babylon upon their foreheads (Rev. 17:5). The forehead of a woman a harlot (Jer. 3:3). Obdurate of forehead, and hard of heart (Ezek. 3:7–8).

And I heard the number of them which were sealed, a hundred and forty and four thousand signifies all who acknowledge the Lord to be the God of heaven and earth, and are in truths of doctrine from the good of love from him through the Word. That these are signified by “a hundred and forty and four thousand out of the twelve tribes of Israel,” is because “the twelve tribes of Israel” signify the church from those who are in good and truth from the Lord, and acknowledge him as the God of heaven and earth. By the number “one hundred and forty-four thousand,” all these are meant; for by this number the same is signified as by twelve, since it arises by multiplying “twelve” into “twelve,” and then by multiplying it by “one hundred” and by “one thousand”; and any number whatever multiplied into itself, and then by “ten,” “one hundred,” or “one thousand,” has a like signification as the original number; therefore the number “one hundred and forty-four thousand” signifies the same as “one hundred and forty-four,” and this the same as “twelve,” because “twelve” multiplied by “twelve”"

This is what is signified in general by “the twelve tribes of Israel,” and also by “the Lord’s twelve apostles”; but, in particular, some truth from good is signified by each tribe, and by each apostle. But the signification of each particular tribe shall be explained presently. Since the twelve tribes signify all the truths of doctrine from the good of love from the Lord, they also signify all things of the church; on which account the twelve tribes of Israel represented the church, as did also the twelve apostles. [3] As “twelve” is predicated of the truths and goods of the church, therefore the new Jerusalem, by which is meant the Lord’s new church, is described by the number twelve in every particular, as that: The length and breath of the city was twelve thousand furlongs; that the wall thereof was one hundred and forty-four cubits (Rev. 21:16). One hundred and forty-four is twelve multiplied by twelve.

[4] Because “the twelve tribes” signify the Lord’s church as to all its truths and goods, therefore the number “twelve” became a number of the church, and was used in its holy ceremonies and solemnities, as: In the breastplate of judgment, in which were the urim and thummim, there were twelve precious stones (Exod. 28:21). That twelve loaves of faces were put upon the table in the tabernacle (Lev. 24:5–6). That Moses built an altar below Mount Sinai, and erected twelve pillars (Exod. 24:4).

But what they signify in the series in which they are here mentioned in Revelation, this being different also, shall be explained presently. That “tribes” signify religion, and “the twelve tribes” the church as to all things relating to it is because “tribe” and “scepter,” in the Hebrew language, are one word, and “the scepter” is the kingdom, and the Lord’s kingdom is heaven and the church. 350. Verse 5. Of the tribe of Judah were sealed twelve thousand signifies celestial love, which is love to the Lord, and this with all who will be in the Lord’s new heaven and new church. By “Judah,” in the highest sense is signified the Lord as to celestial love; in the spiritual sense, the Lord’s celestial kingdom and the Word; and in the natural sense, the doctrine of the celestial church from the Word. But here by “Judah” is signified celestial love, which is love to the Lord; and because it is mentioned first in the series, it signifies that love with all who will be of the Lord’s new heaven and new church; for the tribe first named is the all in the rest, it is as their head, and as a universal entering into all things that follow, collecting, qualifying, and affecting them.

[2] It is known that the twelve tribes of Israel, after Solomon’s time, were divided into two kingdoms, the Jewish and Israelitish. The Jewish kingdom represented the Lord’s celestial or priestly kingdom; and the Israelitish kingdom, the Lord’s spiritual kingdom or royalty; the latter, however, was destroyed when there was nothing spiritual left among them; but the Jewish kingdom was preserved, on account of the Word, and because the Lord was to be born there. But when they had wholly adulterated the Word, and thus they could not know the Lord, then their kingdom was destroyed.

The consort of natural love is science, that of spiritual love is intelligence, and that of celestial love is wisdom. [2] That these things are signified by “Reuben,” follows from his being named from “sight,” and spiritual-natural sight is science, spiritual sight is intelligence, and celestial sight is wisdom. Reuben was also the first born of Jacob, and therefore was called by Israel: His might, the beginning of his strength, excellent in eminence, and excellent in valor (Gen. 49:3).

By “Gad,” in the highest sense is signified omnipotence; in the spiritual sense, the good of life, which also is use; and, in the natural sense, work; in this instance uses of life, because it follows after Reuben and Judah, and celestial love through wisdom produces uses. There are three things which cohere and cannot be separated: love, wisdom, and use of life; if one is separated, the other two fall to the ground, as may be seen in Angelic Wisdom Concerning Divine Love and Wisdom (n. 241, 297, 316). That by “Gad” is signified use of life, which is also called fruit, may appear from his being named from a troop or a heap (Gen. 30:10–11); as also from his father Israel’s blessing (Gen. 49:19); and from the blessing of him by Moses (Deut. 33:20–21); and likewise from his inheritance (Num. 32:1–42; 34:14; Deut. 3:16–17; Josh. 13:24–28). Also from the signification of “Gad” in the opposite sense (Isa. 65:11; Jer. 49:1–3). It must be known, that all the tribes of Israel are here divided into four classes, as in the Urim and Thummin, and in the encampments, and that each class contains three tribes, by reason that three cohere as one, as love, wisdom, and use, and as charity, faith, and work; for, as was said, if one is wanting, the other two are not anything. 353.

This love descends proximately from love to the Lord, because the love of the Lord is to do uses to the community, and to each society in the community, and he does these by means of men who are in love to him. That Asher has the above signification, may in some measure be seen from the blessing of his father Israel: Of Asher; his bread shall be fat, and he shall give the dainties of a king (Gen. 49:20)."

But “Naphtali” here signifies the perception of use, and what use is because it follows in the series after Asher, by whom is signified the love of uses; and also because they who have conquered in temptation, have an interior perception of uses; for by temptations the interiors of the mind are opened. The perception which they have is described in Jeremiah 31:33, 34; they feel in themselves what is good, and see in themselves what is true. That “the tribe of Naphtali” signifies angels and men as to that perception, may be confirmed from these things in the Word: Naphtali is upon the heights of the field (Judg. 5:18). The heights of “the field” are the interiors of the church as to perception. Naphtali is satisfied with good pleasure, and full with the blessing of Jehovah; possess thou the west and the south (Deut. 33:23). “To possess the west,” is the good of love serving, and “to possess the south,” is the light of wisdom, which is that perception.

There are three things which follow in order: love to the Lord, wisdom, and use, as was said above (n. 352); so also here, mutual love, understanding or perception, and will or action; these likewise make one, so that if one of them is wanting, the other two are not anything; the will of serving with the action is the effect, thus the ultimate, in which the two former are and co-exist. The reason why “Manasseh” has this signification is because Joseph, who was the father of Manasseh and Ephraim signifies the spiritual of the church; and the spiritual of the church is the good of the will, and at the same time the truth of the understanding; hence it is that “Manasseh” signifies the voluntary of the church, and “Ephraim” its intellectual. “Manasseh” signifies the voluntary of the church, because “Ephraim” signifies its intellectual, as appears manifestly in Hosea, where Ephraim is so frequently mentioned; and as “Manasseh” signifies the voluntary of the church, he also signifies act, for the will is the endeavor of every act, and where there is endeavor there is action when it is possible. Mention is made of “Manasseh” in several places, as when he was born (Gen. 41:50–52); when he was accepted of Jacob as if instead of Simeon (Gen. 48:3–5) and blessed by him (Gen. 48:15, 16); and by Moses, (Deut. 33:17) and moreover in Isaiah 9:18–20; Psalms 60:7; 80:2; 108:8.

Of the tribe of Simeon were sealed twelve thousand signifies spiritual love, which is love towards the neighbor or charity, with those who will be of the Lord’s new heaven and new church. By “Simeon,” in the highest sense is signified providence; in the spiritual sense, love towards the neighbor or charity; and, in the natural sense, obedience and hearing. In the two foregoing series they are treated of who are in the Lord’s celestial kingdom; but in this series they are treated of who are in the Lord’s spiritual kingdom; the love of the latter is called spiritual love, which is love towards the neighbor, and charity. The reason why Simeon and his tribe represented this love, and therefore signify it in the Word, is because he was born after Reuben, and immediately before Levi, and by these three, Reuben, Simeon, and Levi, in their order is signified truth in the understanding, or faith; truth in the will, or charity; and truth in act, or good work; in like manner as by Peter, James, and John. That Simeon and his tribe might therefore represent truth in the will, which is both charity and obedience, he was named from hearing, and to hear signifies both to understand truth and to will or obey it; to understand it when it is said to hear anyone, and to will and obey it, when it is said to listen to anyone, or to hearken. [2] Here something shall be said concerning love towards the neighbor, or charity: love towards the neighbor is the love of obeying the Lord’s commandments, which are chiefly those contained in the second table of the Decalogue, and which are, thou shalt not kill; thou shalt not commit whoredom; thou shalt not steal; thou shalt not bear false witness; thou shalt not covet the things which are thy neighbor’s. The man who will not do such things because they are sins, loves the neighbor; for he does not love the neighbor who hates him, and from hatred wishes to kill him; he does not love the neighbor who desires to commit whoredom with his wife; nor does he love the neighbor who wishes to steal and plunder his goods, and so on. This also, Paul teaches in the following words: For he that loveth another, hath fulfilled the law. For this thou shalt not commit whoredom, thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not steal, thou shalt not bear false witness, thou shalt not covet, and if there be any other"

That the tribe of Levi signifies the love of truth, which is the essential love from which the church is a church, and thence intelligence, may appear from these passages: The sons of Levi are chosen by Jehovah to minister unto him, and to bless in his name (Deut. 21:5). “To bless in the name of Jehovah” is to teach; which they alone can do, who are in the affection of truth, and thence in intelligence. They guard thy Word, and kept thy covenant; they shall teach Jacob thy judgments, and Israel thy law (Deut. 33:8–11). The Lord shall suddenly come to his temple, and he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver, and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver (Mal. 3:1, 3). “To purify the sons of Levi,” is to purify those who are in the affection of truth. As that affection flourishes from intelligence, therefore: The rod of Levi, upon which was written the name of Aaron, blossomed with almonds (Num. 17:2–11)."

Something of this sort is also signified by Issachar in his blessing by Moses: Be glad Zebulon in thy going out, and Issachar in thy tents. They shall call the people unto the mountain; there shall they sacrifice the sacrifices of justice, for they shall suck the abundance of the sea, and the hidden things concealed in the sand (Deut. 33:18–19).

Of the tribe of Zebulon were sealed twelve thousand signifies the conjugial love of good and truth also with those who will be of the Lord’s new heaven and new church. By “Zebulon,” in the highest sense is signified the union of the Divine itself and the Divine human in the Lord; in the spiritual sense, the marriage of good and truth with those who are in heaven and in the church; and, in the natural sense, conjugial love itself; therefore here, by “Zebulon” is signified the conjugial love of good and truth; he was also named from “cohabitation” (Gen. 30:19, 22); and cohabitation is predicated of married partners whose minds are joined into one, for such conjunction is spiritual cohabitation. The conjugial love of good and truth, which is here signified by “Zebulon,” is the conjugial love of the Lord and the church. The Lord is the good of love itself, and gives to the church to be truth"

In this case the marriage of good and truth takes place with man, which is the church itself, and he becomes a heaven. Hence it is that the kingdom of God, that is heaven and the church, is so often compared in the Word to a marriage. 360. Of the tribe of Joseph were sealed twelve thousand signifies the doctrine of good and truth with those who will be of the Lord’s new heaven and new church. By “Joseph” is signified the Lord as to the spiritual Divine, in the spiritual sense, the spiritual kingdom; and, in the natural sense, fructification and multiplication; but by “Joseph” is here signified the doctrine of good and truth, which is with those who are in the Lord’s spiritual kingdom. Joseph here has this signification, because he is named after the tribe of Zebulon, and before the tribe of Benjamin, thus in the middle; and the tribe which is first named in a series or class signifies some love which is of the will; and the tribe which is named after it signifies something of wisdom which is of the understanding; and the tribe which is named last signifies some use or effect derived from them. Thus each series is full. As Joseph signifies the Lord’s spiritual kingdom, therefore he was made ruler in Egypt (Gen. 41:38–44; Psalm 105:17–22); where each particular signifies such things as are of the Lord’s spiritual kingdom. The spiritual kingdom is the Lord’s royalty; and the celestial kingdom is his priesthood. [2] “Joseph,” here signifies the doctrine of good and truth, because he is here in the place of Ephraim; and by “Ephraim” is signified the intellectual of the church; see Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning Sacred Scripture (n. 79); and the intellectual of the church is all from the doctrine of good and truth from the Word. The reason why Joseph is here in the place of Ephraim is because Manasseh, who was Joseph’s other son, and signified the voluntary of the church, was before reckoned among the tribes (n. 355). The intellectual of the church being derived from the doctrine of good and truth, therefore that intellectual, and also that doctrine, are signified by “Joseph” in the following passages:"

Blessed of Jehovah is the land of Joseph, for the precious things of heaven, for the dew, and for the deep lying below; and for the precious things of the products of the sun, and for the precious things of the products of the moons, and for the precious things of the earth and its fulness; let it come upon the head of Joseph (Deut. 33:13–17). By “the precious things” are signified the knowledges of good and truth, from which is doctrine: Who drink from bowls of wine, and are not grieved for the breaking of Joseph (Amos 6:6). And I will make the house of Judah powerful, and I will save the house of Joseph; and they shall be like mighty Ephraim, and their heart shall rejoice as through wine (Zech. 10:6–7).

When by “Zebulon” is signified the conjugial love of good and truth; and by “Joseph,” the doctrine of good and truth; then by “Benjamin” because he is third in the series is signified the life of truth from good. Benjamin has this signification, because he was born last, and was called by his father Jacob, “the son of his right hand” (Gen. 35:18), and by the son of the right hand is signified truth from good; therefore also his tribe dwelt round about Jerusalem, where the tribe of Judah was, and the city of Jerusalem signified the church as to doctrine, and its environs the things which are from doctrine (see Josh. 18:11–28; Jer. 17:26; 32:8, 44; 33:13; and other places)."

Verse 9.

That by “a great multitude” are signified the rest who are not enumerated above, and yet are in the Lord’s heaven and church is plain from verses 9–10, 13–17, where it is said, that “they stood before the throne and before the lamb, clothed in white robes, and palms in their hands”; and that “they serve him in his temple; and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them”; besides many other things. By “numbering,” in the spiritual sense is signified to know what or of what quality they are; that such is the signification of numbering, will be seen in the next paragraph. But who they are in particular, who are meant by those who are called “a great multitude,” cannot be known without first revealing an arcanum.

Those who are enumerated above make the face with all its organs of the senses; but these now mentioned, are those who make the body with all its members. That this is the case has been revealed to me; as also, that they who make the first class of the tribes (verse 5), are those who correspond to the forehead down to the eyes; that they who are of the second class (verse 6) are those who correspond to the eyes, together with the nose; the third class (verse 7), those who correspond to the ears and cheeks; and the"

That elsewhere these are also called “a great multitude,” see below (n. 803, etc., and 811). 364. “To number,” in the spiritual sense signifies to know the quality, because a “number” in the Word does not signify a number, but its quality (n. 10); in this passage therefore, by “a great multitude which no one could number,” in the natural sense is meant what the words import, that there was an immense multitude; but in the spiritual sense is meant that no one but the Lord alone knows their quality. For the Lord’s heaven consists of innumerable societies, and these societies are distinguished according to the varieties of affections in general; in like manner all in each society, are distinguished in particular. The Lord alone knows the quality of the affection of each individual, and disposes all in order according thereto. By “numbering,” the angels understand, to know this quality. The same is meant, in the Word, in these passages: When Belshazzar drank wine out of the vessels of the temple of Jerusalem, there was written upon the wall, Thou art numbered, thou art numbered (Dan. 5:2, 5, 25). I shall go to the gates of hell, I am numbered (Isa. 38:10). A voice of the tumult of the kingdoms, Jehovah of hosts numbereth the host of war (Isa. 13:4).

From the signification of “numbers” and of “numbering,” it may appear why punishment was denounced against David for numbering the people or the tribes of Israel, and why he said to the prophet Gad: I have sinned greatly in what I have done (2 Sam. 24:1, to the end). And why, when the people were numbered by Moses as to all their tribes, it was commanded that: Everyone should give an expiation of his soul to Jehovah in numbering, that there be no plague among them in numbering them (Exod. 30:12). The reason was, because “to number” signified to know their quality as to their spiritual state, thus as to the state of the church meant by “the twelve tribes of Israel,” which the Lord alone knows. 365. Of every nation, and tribes, and peoples, and tongues signifies all in the Christian world, who are in religion from good and in truths from doctrine. By “every nation and tribes,” are meant those who are in religion from good, who are of the lowest heaven (n. 363); by “nations,” those who are in good (n. 920, 921); and by “tribe,” religion (n. 349); by “peoples and tongues” are meant those who are in truths from doctrine; by “peoples,” those who are in truths (n. 483); and by “tongue,” doctrine (n. 282). By “out of every nation, tribes, peoples, and tongues,” taken together in the spiritual sense, are therefore signified all who are in religion from good, and in truths from doctrine."

The same is also signified by “standing before God,” in other parts of the Word; thus: The angel said to Zacharias, I am Gabriel, that standeth before God (Luke 1:19). There shall not be cut off a man standing before me all the days (Jer. 35:19). These are the two sons of oil standing before the Lord of the whole earth (Zech. 4:14).

That “to be clothed with white robes” signifies to have communication and conjunction with the heavens, may be seen above (n. 328). “To hold palms in their hands” signifies confession from Divine truth because “palms” signify Divine truths; for every tree signifies something of the church, and “palms” signify Divine truth in ultimates, which is Divine truth of the sense of the letter of the Word; for this reason: On all the walls of the temple of Jerusalem, within and without, and also upon the doors, were carved cherubim and palms (1 Kings 6:29, 32). The same in the new temple, mentioned in Ezekiel 41:18–20. By “cherubim” is signified the Word (n. 239), and by “palms” Divine truths therein.

In like manner in other places. Because Jericho was a city near Jordan, and by “the river Jordan” was signified that which is first in the church, and this is the Divine truth, such as it is in the sense of the letter of the Word, therefore it was called “the city of palms” (Deut. 34:3; Judg. 1:16; 3:13).

By “the animals and elders” are meant the angels of the higher heavens, as above, and also below (n. 808); but by “angels” are here meant the angels of the lower heavens, thus all in the whole heaven. “To stand” signifies to hear and do what he commands (n. 366). 370.

That “glory” is predicated of the Divine truth, thus of the spiritual Divine (see n. 249). That “wisdom” has relation to the same is evident. That “thanksgiving” has also a like reference is because it is performed from the Divine truth; for man gives thanks from it and by it. 373.

In the preceding article it is said that these three, “honor, power, and might,” in the Word, when applied to the Lord, are predicated of the celestial Divine, or the Divine love, or his Divine good. That “honor” is so predicated, may be seen (n. 249); and “might” (n. 22); and that “power” is so likewise, may be evident from the passages in the Word where it is mentioned. It is to be known, that in all the particulars of the Word there is a marriage of good and truth, and that there are expressions which have relation to good, and expressions which have relation to truth; but these expressions can only be distinguished by those who study the spiritual sense. From that sense it appears what expressions have relation to good or love, and what to truth or wisdom; and from many passages it has been given to know, that “honor, power, and might,” occur when it treats of the Divine good. That “power” also relates to the Divine good may be seen in Matthew 13:54; 24:30; Mark 13:25–26; Luke 1:17, 35; 9:1; 21:27; and elsewhere.

Verse 13. And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, Who are these that are arrayed in white robes, and whence came they? Verse 14. And I said unto him, Lord, thou knowest signifies the desire of knowing, and the will of interrogating, and the answer and information. The reason why John was questioned concerning these things is because it is common in all Divine worship, that man should first will, desire, and pray, and the Lord then answer, inform, and do; otherwise man does not receive anything Divine. Now as John saw “those who were arrayed in white robes,” and was desirous to know and to ask who they were, and as this was perceived in heaven, therefore he was first asked and then informed. The same occurred to the prophet Zechariah, when he saw several things represented to him, as may appear from Zech. 1:9, 19, 21; 4:2, 5, 11–12; 5:2. 6, 10; 6:4. Besides, we frequently read in the Word, that the Lord answers when they call and cry; as in Psalms 4:1; 17:6; 20:9; 34:4; 91:15; 120:1; also, that he gives when they ask (Matthew 7:7, 8; 21:22; John 14:13, 14; 15:7; 16:23–27). But yet the Lord gives them to ask, and what to ask; therefore the Lord knows it beforehand; but still the Lord wills that man should ask first, to the end that he may do it as from himself, and thus that it should be appropriated to him; otherwise, if the petition itself were not from the Lord, it would not be said in those places, that “they should receive whatsoever they asked.” 377. And he said, These are they that come out of great affliction signifies that they are those who have been in temptations, and have fought against evils and falsities.

That “to be washed” signifies to be cleansed from evils and falsities, and so to be reformed and regenerated, may be seen evidently from the following passages: When the Lord hath washed off the filth of the daughters of Zion, and hath washed away the blood of Jerusalem by the spirit of judgment and by the spirit of purifying (Isa. 4:4). Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doing from mine eyes; cease to do evil (Isa. 1:16). Wash thy heart from wickedness, O Jerusalem, that thou mayest be saved (Jer. 4:14). Wash me from my iniquity, and I shall be whiter than snow (Ps. 51:2, 7). If thou shouldst wash thee with nitre, and shouldst take thee much soap, thy iniquity will still retain its spots (Jer. 2:21). If I should wash me in the waters of snow, and should cleanse my hands with soap, still my garments shall abhor me (Job 9:30–31). Who washed his garment in wine, his covering in the blood of grapes (Gen. 49:11). This is said of the celestial church, from which they are who are in love to the Lord, and in the highest sense it is concerning the Lord; “wine” and “the blood of grapes” is the Divine truth spiritual and celestial."

There are evils of falsity and falsities of evil; evils of falsity with those who from religion believe that evils do not condemn, provided they confess with their lips that they are sinners; and falsities of evil with those who confirm evils in themselves. By “robes” are here signified general truths from the Word, which constitute their religious principles as above (n. 378). It is said, “they made white their robes in the blood of the lamb,” because “white” is predicated of truths (n. 167, 231, 232); thus, that they purified falsities by truths. It also signifies that thus they were reformed by the Lord; because all who have fought against evils in the world, and have believed in the Lord, after their departure out of the world, are taught by the Lord, and are withdrawn from the falsities of their religion by truths, and thus are reformed. The reason is because they who shun evils as sins are in the good of life; and the good of life desires truths, and acknowledges and accepts them; but evil of life never. By “the blood of the lamb” here, and in other parts of the Word, it is believed that the Lord’s passion of the cross is signified; but the"

And because the Lord thus fully glorified his human, that is made it Divine, therefore nothing else can be meant by his “flesh,” and “blood” but the Divine in him and from him; by “flesh,” the Divine good of the Divine love; and by “blood,” the Divine truth from that good. [2] “Blood” is mentioned in many places in the Word, and everywhere signifies, in the spiritual sense, the Divine truth of the Lord, which also is the Divine truth of the Word; and, in the opposite sense, the Divine truth of the Word falsified or profaned, as may appear from the following passages: First: that “blood” signifies the Divine truth of the Lord or of the Word is manifest from these considerations: that blood was called “the blood of the covenant,” and “covenant” is conjunction, and this is effected from the Lord by his Divine truth; as in Zechariah: By the blood of thy covenant I will send forth the bound out of the pit (Zech. 9:11). And in Moses: Moses, after he had read the book of the law in the ears of the people, sprinkled half of the blood upon the people, and said, Behold the blood of the covenant, which Jehovah hath made with you concerning all these Words (Exod. 24:3–8). And Jesus took the cup, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it; for this is my blood, that of the new covenant (Matt. 26:27–28; Mark 14:24; Luke 22:20). By “the blood of the new covenant” or testament, nothing else is signified but the Word, which is called “covenant” and “testament,” old and new, thus the Divine truth therein."

This is again evident from these words of the Lord: Verily, verily, I say unto you, except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you. For my flesh is truly food, and my blood is truly drink. He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood, abideth in me, and I in him (John 6:53–56). That by “blood” is here meant the Divine truth, appears manifestly, because it is said that he who drinks has life, and abideth in the Lord, and the Lord in him. That the Divine truth and a life according to it effects this and that the holy supper confirms it, can be known in the church. [4] Since “blood” signifies the Divine truth of the Lord, which is also the Divine truth of the Word, and this is the old and new covenant or testament itself, therefore blood was the most holy representative in the Israelitish church, in which each and all things were correspondences of spiritual things; as that: They should take of the paschal blood, and put it upon the posts and the lintels of the houses, that the plague might not come upon them (Exod. 12:7, 13, 22). The blood of the burnt offering should be sprinkled upon the altar, on the foundations of the altar, upon Aaron, his sons, and their garments (Exod. 29:12, 16, 20–21; Lev. 1:5; 11, 15; 3:2, 8, 13; 4:25, 30, 34; 5:9; 8:15, 24; 17:6; Num. 18:17; Deut. 12:27). Also upon the veil which was over the ark, upon the mercy seat, and upon the horns of the altar of incense (Lev. 4:6, 7, 17–18; 16:12–15). [5] The same is signified by “the blood of the lamb” in the following passage in Revelation:"

For it cannot be thought that Michael and his angels overcame the dragon by anything else than the Divine truth of the Lord in the Word; for, in heaven, the angels cannot think of any blood; nor do they think of the Lord’s passion, but of the Divine truth and of his resurrection. Therefore, when man thinks of the Lord’s blood, the angels perceive his Divine truth; and when he thinks of the Lord’s passion, they perceive his glorification, and then his resurrection only. It has been granted me to know this by much experience. [6] That “blood” signifies the Divine truth is also evident from these words in David: God will preserve the souls of the needy, and precious shall their blood be in his eyes; and they shall live, and he shall give them of the gold of Sheba (Ps. 72:13–15). “Blood precious in the eyes of God” is for the Divine truth with them; “the gold of Sheba” is wisdom from it. In Ezekiel: Gather yourselves together to the great sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel, that ye may eat flesh and drink blood; ye shall drink the blood of the princes of the earth, and ye shall drink blood even to drunkenness, of my sacrifice which I sacrifice for you; thus I will give my glory among the nations (Ezek. 39:17–21). By “blood” here cannot be meant blood, because it is said that “they shall drink the blood of the princes of the earth,” and that “they shall drink blood even to drunkenness.” But the true sense of the Word results, when by “blood” is understood the Divine truth. The Lord’s church also is there treated of, which he was about to establish with the gentiles. [7] Secondly: that “blood” signifies the Divine truth, may be clearly seen from its opposite sense, in which it signifies the Divine truth of the Word falsified or profaned, as is evident from the following passages:"

In these places, and many others, “blood” signifies the truth of the Word falsified, and also profaned; which yet may be seen more manifestly still by reading those passages in the Word in their series. Since therefore by “blood,” in the opposite sense is signified the truth of the Word falsified or profaned, it is evident that by “blood,” in the genuine sense is signified the truth of the Word not falsified. 380.

By “serving the Lord” nothing else is signified; “in his temple” signifies in the church (n. 191). “He that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them” signifies that the Lord continually gives good in the truths which they receive from him. That this is signified by “dwelling among them,” is because in the Word, “to dwell” is predicted of good, and “to serve,” of truth. This arcanum now is to be disclosed, that the marriage of the Lord with the church consists in this: that the Lord flows into angels and men with the good of love, and that angels and men receive him, or the good of his love, in truths; that hereby the marriage of good and truth is effected, which marriage is the church itself, and becomes heaven with them.

But the Lord’s influx with truths into angels and men is not as the influx of good into them, for it is mediate, flowing from good, as light does from fire, being received by them in the understanding, and only so far in the will as they do truths. This then is the marriage of love and wisdom, or of good and truth from the Lord, with those who receive them in the heavens and on earth. This arcanum was disclosed for the sake of making it known how it is to be understood, that the Lord continually gives good in their truths. 381. Verse 16. They shall not hunger any more, neither thirst anymore signifies that hereafter there shall be no deficiency of goods and truths with them. By “not hungering” is signified to have no lack of good, and by “not thirsting” is signified to have no lack of truth; for to hunger is predicated of bread and food, and to thirst, of wine and water; and by “bread” and “food” is signified good and by “wine” and “water” is signified truth; see above (n. 323). 382. Neither shall the sun fall upon them, nor any heat signifies that hereafter they shall not have lusts to evil, nor to the falsity of evil. “The sun shall not fall upon them” signifies that they shall not have lusts to evil, “neither shall any heat fall upon them” signifies that they shall not have lusts to falsity. That “the sun” signifies the Divine love and thence the affections of good; and, in the opposite sense, diabolical love and thence lusts to evil, may be seen above (n. 53). But the reason why “heat” signifies lusts to the falsities of evil is because falsity is produced from evil, as heat is from the sun; for when the will loves evil, the understanding loves falsity, and burns with the lust of confirming it, and evil confirmed in the understanding is the falsity of evil; consequently the falsity of evil is evil in its form. “Heat” and “to be hot” have a like signification in the following passages: Blessed is the man that trusteth in Jehovah, he shall not see when heat cometh (Jer. 17:7–8)."

If it be asked, how he alone can feed all, be it known that it is because he is God, and because in the whole heaven he is as the soul in its body, for heaven is from him as one man. “To feed” is to teach, because the church in the Word is called “a flock” and the men of the church are called “sheep” and “lambs,” hence “to feed” signifies to teach, and “the shepherd” one that teaches; and this in many places, as: In that day they shall feed the flocks in a wide meadow (Isa. 30:23).

But suddenly a window was made on the right side; and then I heard them complain that they were in darkness. Shortly afterwards a window was made on the left side, and that on the right was closed; upon which the darkness gradually dispersed, and they seemed to themselves to be in the light. After this I was permitted to go in through the door and hear. There was a table in the middle, and benches round about; but they all seemed to me to stand upon the benches, and to dispute sharply with one another concerning faith and charity; on one side, that faith was the principal thing of the church; on the other, that charity was. They who made faith the principal, said, “Have we not to do with God by faith, and with man by charity? Is not faith therefore heavenly, and charity earthly? Are we not saved by what is heavenly, and not by what is earthly? Again, cannot God give faith from heaven, because it is heavenly, and must not man procure to himself charity, because it is earthly? And what man procures for himself is not of the church, and therefore does not save? Can anyone be justified in the sight of God by works, which are called works of charity? Believe us, we are not only justified, but also sanctified by faith alone, provided that faith be not defiled by things meritorious, which are from the works of charity.” Besides many more things."

Do you not see that it is absurd in you to say that charity is earthly? Charity is heavenly, and because you do not do the good of charity, your faith is earthly. How do you receive faith but as a stock or a stone? You say by the hearing of the Word only. But how can the Word operate by being heard only, and this too upon a stock or a stone?

He took off a turban from his head, and placed it on the table; but suddenly put it on again, because he was bald.

I have thought of these things with myself for a long time, and have at length discovered, that man may receive faith from God, which is spiritual, but that he cannot be moved by God to charity, which is spiritual, except as a pillar of salt.” [4] Having said this he was applauded by those who were in faith alone, but hooted by those who were in charity; and the latter said, with indignation, “Hear, friend; you do not know that there is a moral life which is spiritual, and that there is a moral life merely natural; a moral life which is spiritual with those who do good from God, and yet as if from themselves; and a moral life merely natural with those who do good from hell, and yet as if from themselves.” [5] It was said that the disputation was heard as a gnashing of teeth, and as a knocking, with which a grating sound was mixed."

      "text": "APOCALYPSE REVEALED 396 THE EXPLANATION 387. There are two kingdoms into which the entire heaven is divided, the celestial kingdom and the spiritual kingdom. The celestial kingdom consists of those who are in love to the Lord and thence in wisdom; and the spiritual kingdom consists of those who are in love towards the neighbor, and thence in intelligence; and as love towards the neighbor is at this day called “charity” and intelligence, “faith,” the latter kingdom consists of those who are in charity, and thence in faith. Now, because heaven is distinguished into two kingdoms, hell also is distinguished into two kingdoms that are opposite to them; into the diabolical kingdom and into the satanic kingdom. The diabolical kingdom consists of those who are in the love of dominion from love of self and thence in foolishness; for this love is opposite to celestial love, and its foolishness is opposite to celestial wisdom; but the satanic kingdom consists of those who are in the love of dominion from the pride of their own intelligence, and thence in insanity; for this love is opposite to spiritual love, and its insanity is opposite to spiritual intelligence. By foolishness and insanity are meant foolishness and insanity in things celestial and spiritual. Similar things are to be understood of the church on earth as are said of heaven, for they make one. Concerning these two kingdoms, see Heaven and Hell, published at London (n. 20–28), and see also many other places. [2] Now, as Revelation treats only of the state of the church at its end (as was observed in the preface, and at n. 2), therefore what now follows treats of those who are in the two kingdoms of heaven, and of those who are in the two kingdoms of hell, and of their quality. From this chapter (Rev. 8:8–16), of those who are in the spiritual kingdom, and in the satanic kingdom opposite to it; in chapters 17–18, of those who are in the celestial kingdom, and in the diabolical kingdom opposite to it; and afterwards of the last judgment; and at length of the new church which is the new Jerusalem; this bringing all that goes before to a conclusion, because it is the end on account of which they are.

And when he had opened the seventh seal signifies exploration by the Lord of the state of the church, and thence of the state of life of those who are in his spiritual kingdom, being those who are in charity and its faith; in this case, who are in faith alone. That this is the signification of these words, may appear from all the particulars of this chapter when understood in the spiritual sense. For this chapter and the following to chapter 16 treat of those who are in the spiritual kingdom, or those who are in love towards the neighbor and thence in intelligence, as was said above (n. 387). But since, at this day, they say “charity” instead of love towards the neighbor, and “faith” instead of intelligence; and here there is not any exploration of those who are in charity and thence in faith, because these belong to such as are in heaven; therefore exploration is here made of those who are in faith alone. Faith alone is also faith separated from charity, there being no conjunction (see below, n. 417). That “to open the seal” signifies to explore states of life, or, what is the same thing, the states of the church and thence of life, see above, n. 295, 302, 309, 317, 324. 389. There was silence in heaven as of half an hour signifies that the angels of the Lord’s spiritual kingdom were greatly amazed, when they saw those who said they were in faith, in such a state. By “silence in heaven,” nothing else is meant but amazement there in regard to those who say they are in faith, and yet are in such a state; for their state is described in what follows, the quality of which can be seen from the explanation. By “half an hour” is signified greatly, because by “an hour” is signified a full state. That “time” signifies state, will be seen below. 390. Verse 2. And I saw the seven angels who stood before God signifies the entire spiritual heaven in the presence of the Lord, hearing and doing what he commands. By “seven angels” is signified the entire heaven, because “seven” signifies all, or all things, thence the whole and entire (n. 10); and by “angels,” in the highest sense, is signified the Lord, and, in a relative sense, heaven"

And there were given to them seven trumpets signifies the exploration and disclosure of the state of the church, and thence of the life of those who are in faith alone. Here, by “trumpets” the same thing is signified as by “sounding,” because they sounded with them, and by “sounding with trumpets” is signified to call together upon solemn occasions, which were various; in this case, to explore and discover the quality of those who are in faith alone, thus the quality of those who are at this day of the churches of the Reformed. It should be known, that the church in the Reformed world is at this day divided into three, from the three leaders, Luther, Calvin, and Melancthon, and that these three churches differ in various things; but in this article, that man is justified by faith without the works of the law, they all agree, which is remarkable. That by “sounding with trumpets” is signified to call together, will be seen below (n. 397). 392. Verse 3. And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer signifies spiritual worship, which is from the good of charity by the truths of faith. By “the altar” at which the angel stood, and by “the golden censer” which he had in his hand, is signified the worship of the Lord from spiritual love, which worship is from the good of charity by the truths of faith. With the sons of Israel there were two altars, one without the tent, and the other within it; the altar without the tent was called “the altar of burnt offering,” because burnt offerings and sacrifices were offered upon it. The altar within the tent was called “the altar of incense,” as also “the golden altar.” There were two altars, because the worship of the Lord is from celestial love and from spiritual love; from celestial love by those who are in his celestial kingdom, and from spiritual love by those who are in his spiritual kingdom; concerning these two kingdoms, see above (n. 387). Concerning the two altars, see the following passages in Moses: concerning the altar of burnt offering see Exod. 20:24–26; 27:1–8; 39:38–39; Lev. 7:1–5; 8:11; 16:18, 19, 33–34; concerning the altar of incense see"

That altars, censers, and incense, were seen by John, was not because such things exist in heaven, these were only represen tative of the worship of the Lord there; the reason is, because such things were instituted among the sons of Israel, and are therefore often mentioned in the Word; and that church was a representative church, for all things of their worship represented and thence they now signify the Divine celestial and spiritual things of the Lord, which are of his church in the heavens and on the earth. [2] The same is therefore signified by the two altars spoken of in the Word, in the following passages: O send out thy light and thy truth, let them lead me to thy habitation, and I will go to the altar of God, unto God (Ps. 43:3–4). I will wash my hands in innocence; and so will I compass thy altar, O Jehovah; and I will make the voice of thanksgiving to be heard (Ps. 26:6–7). The sin of Judah is written with a pen of iron upon the tablet of their heart, and upon the horns of your altars (Jer. 17:1–2). God is Jehovah, who enlighteneth us; bind the festal offering with cords unto the horns of the altar (Ps. 118:27).

The angel stood and said, Measure the temple of God and the altar, and them that adore therein (Rev. 11:1). I heard another angel from the altar, saying, True and just are thy judgments (Rev. 16:7). Since representative worship, which was performed chiefly upon two altars, was abrogated by the Lord when he came into the world, because he himself opened the interiors of the church; therefore it is said in Isaiah: In that day shall a man look to his maker, and his eyes shall have respect to the holy one of Israel, and not to the altars, the work of his hands (Isa. 17:7–8). 393. And there was given him much incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne signifies propitiation lest the angels of the Lord’s spiritual kingdom should be hurt by the spirits of the satanic kingdom, that were below. By “the incense” and by “the golden altar” is signified the worship of the Lord from spiritual love (n. 277, 392); by “prayers” are signified those things which relate to charity and thence to faith in worship (n. 278); and by “saints” are meant those who are of the Lord’s spiritual kingdom; and by “the just,” those who are of his celestial kingdom (n. 173). From this it may appear, that they who are in the Lord’s spiritual kingdom are here treated of. That here “much incense offered with the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar” signifies propitiation lest they should be hurt by the spirits of the satanic kingdom who were below, because propitiations and expiations were made by incense, especially when dangers threatened; as may appear from the following passages:"

The altar of incense was also placed in the tent, before the mercy seat that was over the ark, and incense was offered on it every morning when the lamps were trimmed (Exod. 30:1–10). And it was commanded, that as often as Aaron entered within the veil, he should offer incense, and the cloud of incense should cover the mercy seat, lest he should die (Lev. 16:11–13). From these things it may appear, that propitiations in the representative Israelitish church were made by offering incense; in like manner here, that they might not be hurt by the satanic spirits who were below. 394. Verse 4. And the smoke of the incense went with the prayers of the saints, out of the hand of the angel before God signifies the protection of them by the Lord. By “the smoke of the incense went up before God” is signified what is accepted and grateful; wherefore the like is said by David: Let my prayers be accepted before thee as incense (Ps. 141:2). The reason was, because the smoke of the incense was fragrant from the aromatics of which it was composed, which were stacte, onycha, galbanum, and frankincense (Exodus 30:34); and the fragrance of those aromatics corresponds to such things as are of spiritual love or charity, and thence of faith; for in heaven most fragrant odors are sensibly perceived corresponding to the perceptions of the angels originating from their love. Therefore it is also said in many parts of the Word, that “Jehovah smelled an odor of rest.” That protection by the Lord is signified, follows from what was said above (n. 393). 395. Verse 5.

That by “a censer,” as well as by “incense,” is signified worship from spiritual love, is evident from what was shown above; and also from this, that in the Word, the thing containing signifies the same as the thing contained, as a cup and platter signify the same as wine and food (Matthew 23:25, 26; Luke 22:20; and in other places). By “the fire of the altar of burnt offering,” is signified the Divine celestial love, because by that altar was signified worship from that love, as may be seen above (n. 392); and by “fire,” in the highest sense, is signified the Divine love (n. 494). Spiritual love, which is charity, derives its essence from celestial love, which is love to the Lord; without this love there is nothing vital in spiritual love or charity, for spirit and life is from no other source than from the Lord. This was represented in the Israelitish church by their taking fire for the censers when they offered incense, only from the altar of burnt offering; as may appear in Moses (Leviticus 16:12–13, Numbers 16:46–47); and that: The two sons of Aaron were consumed by fire from heaven, because they offered incense from strange fire (that is, from fire not taken from the altar) (Lev. 10:1–2). Therefore it was also ordained, that: Fire should burn continually on the altar of burnt offering, and should not be put out (Lev. 6:13). This was because the fire of that altar signified the Divine love of the Lord, and thence love to the Lord. By “casting the censer upon the earth” is signified influx into lower things. 396.

For earthquakes take place in the world of spirits, when the state of the church in the societies is perverted and inverted. The reason why the censer was cast unto the earth by the angel, before the seven angels began to sound with the trumpets, was that by influx communication might be opened between those who were in the spiritual heaven, with those below who were in faith alone; from which communication there arose reasonings and confirmations in favor of it, which were also heard and perceived; wherefore it is said that after communication was opened, they were heard and perceived. 397. Verse 6. And the seven angels that had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound signifies that they were prepared and girded to explore the state of the church, and thence the state of life, with those whose religion is faith alone. What is signified by “trumpets,” appears from the statute respecting the use of them with the sons of Israel, concerning which it is thus written in Moses: Jehovah spake unto Moses to make trumpets of silver for the calling of the assembly, and for the journeying of the camps; and that they should sound with them on days of joy, festivals, new moons, over burnt offerings and sacrifices; also, that when they went to war against enemies that infested them, they should blow an alarm with the trumpets, and that then they should come into remembrance before Jehovah God, and should be preserved from their enemies (Num. 10:1–10). From these words it may be seen what is signified by “sounding with trumpets.” That here by “the seven angels sounding,” is signified the exploration and manifestation of what the state of the church is with those whose religion is faith alone, is evident from the particulars of this chapter, and from the particulars of the"

Jehovah shall appear upon them, and his arrow shall go forth as the lightning, and the Lord Jehovih shall sound the trumpet (Zech. 9:14). Jehovah shall go forth as a lion and sound (Isa. 42:13).

It shall hail, until the forest sinketh itself down (Isa. 32:19). The temple of God was opened in heaven, and there were lightnings, and voices, and thunders, and an earthquake, and great hail (Rev. 11:19).

That “trees” in general signify men as to their affections and perceptions therefrom, may appear from the following passages: All the trees of the field shall know, that I Jehovah have brought down the high tree, I have exalted the low tree, I have dried up the green tree, and I have made the dry tree to shoot forth (Ezek. 17:24). Happy is the man that trusteth in Jehovah, for he shall be like a tree planted by the waters, he shall not cease from bearing fruit (Jer. 17:7–8).

By “being burnt up” is signified to perish, as just above (n. 400); by “green grass,” in the Word, is signified that good and truth of the church or of faith, which first springs up in the natural man; the same also is signified by “the herb of the field”; and because faith lives from good and truth, therefore by “all green grass was burnt up” is signified that every living thing of faith perished; and every living thing of faith perishes when there is no affection of good and perception of truth, of which just above. That “grass” signifies this is also from correspondence; wherefore they who separate faith from charity, not only in doctrine but also in life, in the spiritual world pass the time in a desert, where there is not even grass. As “a fruit tree” signifies man as to the affections of good and the perceptions of truth, so “green grass” signifies man as to that of the church which is first conceived and also born in him, and “grass not green” signifies the same destroyed. In general all things which are in gardens, woods, fields, and plains signify man as to something of the church, or what is the same, something of the church with him; the reason is because they correspond. That “grass” has this signification, may appear from these passages: The voice said, Cry; and he said, What shall I cry? All flesh is grass, the grass withereth, and the flower fadeth, because the wind hath breathed upon it; truly the people is grass. The grass withereth and the flower fadeth, but the Word of our God shall stand for ever (Isa. 40:5–8)."

General truths are falsified with such because they are in them alone, for they do not know the particulars of that faith, as the clergy do; it is from the general truths with them that they appear as in a sea in the spiritual world; the reason is, because waters signify truths (n. 50), and the sea is their general receptacle (n. 238). 405.

The reason is because the Word communicates with heaven, therefore when it is read by man, the truths therein ascend into heaven, and the falsities to which truths are adjoined or conjoined tend towards hell, whence there is a rending asunder, whereby the life of the Word is extinguished. But this is the case only with those who confirm falsities by the Word, but not with those who do not confirm them. I have seen such rendings asunder, and have heard the noise like that of wood split by the fire on a hearth.

Meal signifies truth from good."

And the fourth angel sounded signifies the exploration and manifestation of the state of the church with those whose religion is faith alone, that they are in the evils of falsity, and in the falsities of evil. That this is the signification of these words, is evident from what follows, when understood in the spiritual sense. “To sound” signifies here, as before, to explore and make manifest (n. 398, 402, 407). 413. And the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars, so that the third part of them was darkened signifies that by reason of evils from falsities and of falsities from evils, they did not know what love is, or what faith is, or any truth. By “the third part” is signified all (n. 400); by “the sun” is signified love (n. 53); by “the moon” is signified intelligence and faith (n. 332); by “stars” are signified the knowledges of truth and good from the Word (n. 51); by “being darkened” is signified not to be seen or known by reason of evils from falsities and falsities from evils. Evils from falsities are with those who assume the falsities of religion, and confirm them till they appear as truths, and when they live according to them they do evils from falsities, or the evils of falsity. But those have falsities from evils, who do not regard evils as sins; and still more those who, by reasonings from the natural man, and more still from the Word, confirm with themselves that evils are not sins. The confirmations themselves are falsities from evils, and are called the falsities of evil. [2] The reason that “darkness” signifies this is because light signifies truth; and when the light is extinguished, there comes darkness. In confirmation the passages will first be adduced, where similar things to those here in Revelation are said of “the sun, the moon, and the stars,” and of “the darkness” arising from the extinction of them: The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and terrible day of Jehovah cometh (Joel 2:31). The stars of the heavens and their constellations shall not shine with their light; the sun shall be darkened in his rising; and the moon shall not make her light to shine (Isa. 13:10; see also 24:23)."

The day of Jehovah is near; the sun and the moon are blackened, and the stars shall withdraw their brightness (Joel 2:10). Immediately after the affliction of those days the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven (Matt. 24:29; Mark 13:24–25). Who, that elevates his mind, cannot see that the sun, the moon, and the stars of the world are not meant in these cases? [3] That falsities of various kinds are signified by “darkness,” is evident from these passages: Woe to them that desire the day of Jehovah; it is a day of darkness and not of light: is not the day of Jehovah darkness, and not light, thick darkness, and not brightness? (Amos 5:18, 20). The day of Jehovah is a day of darkness and thick darkness, a day of cloud and of cloudiness (Zeph. 1:15).

Behold, darkness covereth the earth, and thick darkness the peoples (Isa. 60:2). Give glory to Jehovah, before he cause darkness: we wait for light, but he maketh it thick darkness (Jer. 13:16). We wait for light, but behold darkness, and not brightness; we walk in thick darkness; we stumble at noon as in the twilight, as if dead among the living (Isa. 59:9–10).

Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness seize upon you: I am come a light into the world, that everyone that believeth in me should not abide in darkness (John 12:35, 46). When I sit in darkness Jehovah is a light unto me (Micah 7:8). This is the judgment, that light hath come into the world; but men loved the darkness more than the light (John 3:19; 1:4–5). If the light [lumen] that is in thee be darkness, how great is the darkness (Luke 11:34–36). This is your hour, and the power of darkness (Luke 22:53).

The Divine truth, in the spiritual sense of the Word, is like the light of the sun by day; and the Divine truth in the natural sense of the Word, is like the light of the moon and stars by night. The spiritual sense of the Word also flows into its natural sense as the sun does with its light into the moon, which gives forth the light of the sun in a mediate manner. In the same way does the spiritual sense of the Word enlighten men, even those who know nothing at all concerning it, whilst they read the Word in its natural sense; but it enlightens the spiritual man, as the sun’s light does the eye; but the natural man, as the light of the moon and stars enlighten his eye. Everyone is enlightened according to the spiritual affection of truth and good, and at the same time according to genuine truths, by which he has opened his rational faculty. [2] The same is meant by “day” and “night,” in the following passages: And God said, Let there be luminaries in the expanse of the heavens to distinguish between the day and the night; and God made two great luminaries, the great luminary to rule in the day, and the lesser luminary to rule in the night; and the stars: And God set them in the expanse of the heavens to give light upon the earth, and to rule in the day and in the night, and to distinguish between the light and the darkness (Gen. 1:14–19). Jehovah made great luminaries, the sun to rule in the day, the moon and stars to rule in the night (Ps. 136:7–9). To thee, O Jehovah, is the day, and to thee the night; thou hast prepared the light and the sun (Ps. 74:16). Jehovah that giveth the sun for the light of the day, the statutes of the moon and stars for the light of the night (Jer. 31:35). If ye can make void my covenant of the day and my covenant of the night, that there should not be day and night in their season, my covenant also with David my servant shall be made void; if I have not set my covenant of the day and of the night, the statutes of heaven and earth, I will also reject the seed of Jacob and of David (Jer. 33:20–21, 25–26)."

Wherefore I approached nearer, and as I drew near, the likenesses of animals disappeared, and instead of them were seen men. And it was shown, that they who constituted the flock of goats, were those who had confirmed themselves in the doctrine of justification by faith alone; and they who constituted the flock of sheep, were those who believed that charity and faith are a one, as good and truth are a one. [2] And then I spoke with those who had been seen as goats, and said, “Why are you thus assembled?” They consisted chiefly of clergy, who gloried in their fame for erudition, because they knew the arcana of justification by faith alone. They said that they were assembled to sit in council, because they had heard that what is said by Paul (Romans 3:28), that “man is justified by faith without the works of the law,” was not rightly understood, because Paul by “the works of the law” meant the works of the Mosaic law, which was for the Jews; which we also clearly see from his words to Peter; whom he rebuked for judaizing, when yet he knew that “no one is justified by the works of the law” (Galatians 2:14–16); also, that he distinguishes between the law of faith and the law of works; and between Jews and Gentiles, or circumcision and uncircumcision, meaning by circumcision, Judaism, as everywhere else; and likewise from his summing up with these words: Do we then abrogate the law through faith? Not so, but we establish the law (Rom. 3:31). He says all these things in one series (Romans 3:27–31); and he also says in the preceding chapter:"

This is the law of the sacrifice (Lev. 7:1). This is the law of the sacrifice of the peace offering (Lev. 7:7, 11 seq.).

To this they added also what they had seen in Paul, that the law of the Decalogue was to be lived, and that it is fulfilled by charity, which is love towards the neighbor (Romans 13:8–11); thus not by faith alone. They said that this was the reason of their being convened.

But then thunder was heard, and lightning seen from above; and presently there appeared an angel standing between the two flocks, who cried to the flock of sheep, “Do not hearken to them; they have not receded from their former faith, which is, that God the Father hath compassion for the sake of the Son; which faith is not faith in the Lord; neither is faith a tree, but man is a tree; but do the work of repentance, and look to the Lord, and you will have faith; faith before that, is not a faith in which"

Are not faith and charity a one, as a tree and its fruit are one? For the tree by its branch is continued into the fruit. Tear away anything from the branch which flows by continuity into the fruit, and will not the fruit perish?

And then they replied that it was so, that faith is preserved by the fruit; but they would not say faith is continued in the fruit. [6] But then one of the priests, who was among the sheep on the right hand, rose up and said, “They have answered you that it is so, but they have told their companions that it is not so; for they think otherwise.” Wherefore they inquired, “How, then, do they think? Do they not think as they teach?” He said, “No; they think that every good of charity, which is called a good work, done by man for the sake of salvation or eternal life, is not good but evil, by reason that man desires to save himself by his own works, by claiming to himself the justice and merit of the only savior; and that it is so with every good work, in which man feels his own will. Therefore among themselves they call good works from man, not blessed, but cursed; and say that they merit hell rather than heaven.” [7] But the flock on the left hand said, “You speak falsehoods against them; do they not preach manifestly before us charity and its works, which they call the works of faith?” He replied, “You do"

They say, also, that a vine produces grapes; but that if a man were to do spiritual goods as a vine grapes, he would produce wild grapes.” [8] But then they asked, “What is the nature of their goods of charity or works, which are the fruits of faith?” He replied, “They are inconspicuous, being inwardly in man from the Holy Spirit, concerning which man knows nothing.” But they said, “If a man knows nothing concerning them, there must surely be some conjunction, or how could they be called works of faith? perhaps those insensible goods are then insinuated into the voluntary works of man by some mediating influx, as by some affection, aspiration, inspiration, incitation, and excitation of the will; by a tacit perception in thought and thence exhortation, contrition, and thus by conscience, and thence by impulse and obedience to the Decalogue and the Word, as an infant, or as a wise man, or by something else of a similar nature.” But he replied, “No; and if they say it is effected by such means because by faith, still they bury them with words in their discourses in such a manner that the result after all is, that they do not proceed from faith; some, however, do maintain such things, but as the signs of faith, but not as its bonds with charity. Some have nevertheless thought of a conjunction by the Word.” And then they said, “Is there not thus conjunction, when man voluntarily acts according to the Word?” But he replied, “This is not what they think; they ascribe it solely to the hearing the Word, thus not to the understanding of the Word, lest anything should manifestly"

What is more ludicrous?” After this a certain man of the flock of the right hand, who excelled the rest in judgment, requested to be heard, and said, “I heard a certain person say, ‘I have planted a vineyard, now will I drink wine even to intoxication.’ But another asked, ‘Will you drink the wine out of your own cup by your own right hand?’ And he said, ‘No; but out of an inconspicuous cup from an inconspicuous hand.’ And the other replied, ‘Of a certainty then you will not be intoxicated.’” Presently the same man said, “But hear me, I beseech you; I say unto you, drink wine from the Word understood.

Who can say, when doing anything from a king, from his mouth and will, ‘I do this from myself, from my own mouth or command, and from my own will?’ After this he turned to the clergy, and said, “Ye ministers of God, seduce not the flock.” [10] On hearing these things, the greater part of the flock on the left hand receded, and joined themselves with the flock on the right; some of the clergy also then said, “We have heard what we"

Verse 6. “And in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it; and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them” signifies that they wish that in matters of faith the understanding should be shut up and the will closed, by which means spiritual light and life are extinguished, and that yet this cannot be done (n. 429).

The reason is, because the confirmation of falsity is the denial of truth; therefore when they hear any spiritual truth, which is a truth of the Word serviceable to those who are of the church for doctrine and life, they keep their minds fixed in the falsities which they have confirmed, and then they either veil over the truth they have heard with falsities, or reject it as a mere sound, or yawn at it and avert themselves; and this in the degree in which they are in the pride of their own erudition; for pride glues falsities together, so that at last they cohere like the hardened foam of the sea.

There is also an abyss beneath the one just mentioned, where they are who in like manner have confirmed justification and salvation by faith alone, but who by themselves in their spirit have denied God, and in their hearts have laughed at the holy things of the church. There they do nothing but quarrel, tear their garments, climb upon the tables, kick, and fight with each other with vituperations; and because no one is there permitted to do mischief to the body of another, they menace with their faces and fists.

By “the pit of the abyss” is signified the hell above described (n. 421); by “the smoke” from thence, are signified the falsities from lusts; and because it is said “the smoke as of a great furnace,” the falsities of lusts springing from evil loves are meant, for “fire” signifies love (n. 468); and “the fire of hell,” evil love (n. 494). “A great furnace” has a like signification, because it smokes from fire. Infernal spirits are not in any material fire, but in spiritual fire, which is their love; therefore they do not feel any other fire; on which subject see in Heaven and Hell, published at London in 1758 (n. 134, 566–575). Every love in the spiritual world, when it is excited, appears at a distance as fire, within the hells as a glowing fire, and without, as the smoke of a fire or as the smoke of a furnace. The falsities of the lusts springing from evil loves, are also described by “smoke from a fire” and “from a furnace,” in other parts of the Word, as in these passages: Abraham looked towards Sodom and Gomorrah, and beheld, and lo, the smoke of the earth went up as the smoke of a furnace (Gen. 19:28). The sun set, and there was thick darkness, and behold, a furnace of smoke and a torch of fire, that passed between those pieces (Gen. 15:17). They go on to sin, therefore they shall be as the smoke out of the chimney (Hos. 13:2–3). The wicked shall perish, into smoke shall they consume (Ps. 37:20). And I will show signs in heaven, and on the earth, fire, and pillars of smoke (Joel 2:30).

And out of the smoke there went forth locusts upon the earth signifies that from them were falsities in the outermost parts, such as prevail with those who have become sensual, and see and judge of all things from the senses and their fallacies. They are called falsities in the outermost parts, which occupy the outermost things of man’s life, and are called sensual, concerning which we shall speak presently; these are signified by “locusts,” in the Word: but it is to be known that they did not appear like the locusts of the field, which leap about and lay waste the meadows and the crops, but like pygmies or dwarfs, which is evident also from their description, in that “they had crowns on their heads, faces like men, hair like women, teeth like lions, breastplates of iron, and a king over them, the angel of the abyss.” That dwarfs were also called “locusts” by the ancients, may be concluded from these passages: The spies of the land of Canaan said, We saw the Nephilim, the sons of the Anakim, and we were in their eyes as locusts (Num. 13:33). Jehovah who sitteth upon the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof are as locusts (Isa. 40:22). [2] But because falsities in outermost things, such as prevail among them, are signified by “locusts” in the Word, therefore they are called “locusts,” as also “crowned” and “commanders,” in Nahum: The fire shall devour thee, it shall eat thee up like the canker worm; make thyself many as the canker worm, make thyself many as the locust; thy crowned are as the locust, and thy commanders as the locust of locusts (Nah. 3:15–17)."

And the locust went up over all the land of Egypt; before it there was no such locust, and it did eat every herb of the field, and afterwards Moses stretched forth his rod, and the locust was cast into the Red Sea (Exod. 10:12, and subsequent verses).

What then must be the case with a layman, who simply thinks of faith from charity, when he hears these mysteries? From what has been said, it may be seen that faith alone justifying is the faith of the clergy, and not of the laity, except of those who live unconcernedly, who imbibe no more from their arcana than that faith alone saves; that they cannot do good from themselves, nor fulfil the law, that Christ suffered for them; besides some other universals of a similar nature. 427.

And it was given to them that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented five months signifies that from the Divine providence of the Lord, they are not able to take away from those who are not in the faith of charity the faculty of understanding and willing what is true and good, but that they should only be able to induce stupor for a short time. By “its being given them,” is signified that it is from the Divine providence of the Lord, as above; “not to be able to kill them” signifies not to be able to take away from those who are not in the faith of charity the faculty of understanding and willing what is true and good, for when this faculty is taken away, man is spiritually killed. By “tormenting them five months,” is signified to induce stupor for a short time; “five” signifies a little, or a short time, and “to torment” signifies to induce stupor, because this is what is signified by “a scorpion” (n. 425); and by “the torment like that of a scorpion,” as follows (n. 428).

[2] That “five months” signify a little, and a short time, is because that is signified by “five”; for times, whether they be hours, days, weeks, months, or years, do not signify time but state; and the numbers determine its quality (n. 4, 10, 348, 947). That “five” signifies something, and also a little, may appear from these passages: A thousand shall flee at the rebuke of five (Isa. 30:17). Five shall pursue a hundred (Lev. 26:8). Jesus said, The kingdom of the heavens is like unto ten virgins, of whom five were prudent and five were foolish (Matt. 25:1–2). By “ten virgins” are signified all in the church; by “five” are signified a certain part or some of them. The like is signified by “ten” and “five” in the parable: There were given unto the servants talents that they should trade, and one with his talent gained ten talents, and another five (Luke 19:13–20). “Ten talents” signify much, and “five talents” a little. Besides other places (as in Isaiah 17:6; 19:18–19; Matthew 14:15-22). 428. And their torment was as the torment of a scorpion when it striketh a man signifies that this is from their persuasive power. This follows from what was said (n. 427); for by “torment” is signified the stupor, which their persuasive power induces upon the understanding, as the scorpion does upon the body when he stings it. “The scorpion” signifies that persuasive power (n. 425). In the spiritual world there exists a persuasive power which takes away the understanding of truth, and induces stupor and thus distress upon the mind; but this persuasive power is unknown in the natural world."

And in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it; and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them signifies that it is the desire of those who are in the doctrine of faith separated, that in matters of faith the understanding should be shut up and the will closed, and thus that they should not have any spiritual light and life; but that it is nevertheless provided by the Lord that the understanding should not be shut up, nor the will closed, lest spiritual light and life with man should be extinguished. “In those days” signifies the last state of the church, when the doctrine of faith alone is universally received. “Men shall seek death” signifies that they will that, in matters of faith, the understanding should be shut up; “and shall not find it” signifies that it is provided of the Lord, that this should not be done; “and shall desire to die” signifies that they also wish to have the will closed in them; “and death shall flee from them” signifies that it is provided that neither should take place; for thus spiritual light and life would be extinguished, and man would spiritually die. “To seek,” is predicated of the understanding; and “to desire,” of the will; and “death,” of both. That this is the signification of these words, is evident; otherwise, what meaning could there be in that “men should seek death in those days and not find it, and should desire to die and death should flee from them?” For by “death,” no other death is meant but spiritual death, which is induced when the understanding is removed from the things that are to be believed; for in this case man does not know whether he thinks and does what is true, or what is false, thus whether he thinks and acts with the angels of heaven, or with the devils of hell. 430. Verse 7. And the likenesses of the locusts signifies the appearances and images of those who have confirmed in themselves faith separated from charity. By “likenesses,” is signified their appearances in a representative image; by “locusts,” are signified falsities in outermost things (n. 424); and as falsities make one with those who are in falsities, they also are signified by “locusts.” That they who have confirmed themselves in faith alone, or their falsities, are meant by “locusts,” appeared evident to me from this circumstance, that the presbyters who were in that faith, embraced the locusts that were seen, and kissed them, and were desirous of"

[2] The church is called “a woman” in these passages: There were two women of one mother, and they committed whoredom in Egypt, Ohola which is Samaria, and Oholiba which is Jerusalem (Ezek. 23:2–4).

By “women” are signified the affections of truth, from which the church is a church, in many passages, as in the following: The women of my people have ye driven out from the house of her delights (Micah 2:9). The families of houses shall mourn apart, and the women apart (Zech. 12:11–13). Stand up, ye secure women, hear my speech (Isa. 32:9) Wherefore do ye evil to cut off from you man and woman?

Sensual things are of two kinds, one which is of the will, and the other of the understanding; the sensual things of the will are signified by “the hair of women,” of which above (n. 434); and the sensual things of the understanding are signified by “teeth”; the latter, or what is the same, sensual men who are in falsities from confirmation, seem to themselves to be in power over all things, so that they cannot be conquered; wherefore the “teeth of the locusts,” by which such sensual things are signified, “were as the teeth of lions,” for by “a lion” is signified power (n. 241). That “teeth” signify the ultimates of man’s life, which are called sensual things, and which, when separated from the interiors of the mind, are in mere falsities, and do violence to truths even to destroying them, may appear from the following passages: My soul, I lie down in the midst of lions, their teeth are spears and darts (Ps. 57:4). O God, destroy their teeth in their mouth, break out the great teeth of the young lions (Ps. 58:6). A nation is come up upon my land, strong, its teeth are the teeth of a lion, and it hath the great teeth of a lion (Joel 1:6). Jehovah, thou breakest the teeth of the ungodly (Ps. 3:7).

For from a false principle nothing but falsities can flow. If truths are advanced, they are only viewed outwardly or superficially, thus also sensually, and are consequently falsified, and, with such persons, become fallacies. The reason why “breastplates” have this signification, is because “wars,” in the Word signify spiritual wars, and thence the “arms of war” signify the various things relating to such wars; as in Jeremiah: Harness the horses and mount, ye horsemen, and stand ye in helmets; polish the lances, and put on the cuirass (Jer. 46:4). In Isaiah: For he put on justice as a cuirass, and an helmet of salvation upon his head (Isa. 59:17).

It was commanded the prophet that he should put a girdle upon his loins, and should afterwards hide it in a hole of a rock by the Euphrates, and when after a short time he took it again, behold, it was rotten, nor was it good for anything (Jer. 13:1–7, 11). And it was also comm anded him that after he should finish reading the book, he should throw it into the midst of the Euphrates, and say, Thus shall Babylon sink, and shall not rise again (Jer. 51:63–64). By these things the interiors of the state of the church with the sons of Israel were represented. That the “river of Egypt,” the Nile, and “the river of Assyria,” the Euphrates, were the boundaries of the land of Canaan, is manifest from this: Jehovah made a covenant with Abraham, Unto thy seed will I give this land, from the river of Egypt even to the great river Euphrates (Gen. 15:18). That the Euphrates was a boundary, see Exodus 23:31; Deuteronomy 1:7, 8; 11:24; Joshua 1:4; Micah 7:12."

How can we appear before God without that means? Is it not the only means? Are we not born in sins, and is not our nature entirely corrupted by the transgression of Adam? Can there be any other means of healing but faith alone? What can our works contribute towards this? Who can do any good work from himself; who can purify, forgive, justify, and save himself? Does not merit and self–righteousness lurk in every work that man does from himself? And if, perchance, we should do anything that was good, could we do all, and fulfil the law? Besides, if anyone sins against one commandment, he sins against all, because they cohere. Why did the Lord come into the world, and suffer so grievously on the cross, but to take away from us damnation and the curse of the law, to reconcile God the Father, and become merit and righteousness alone, which might be imputed to man through faith? Otherwise, what good could be answered by his coming? Since, then, Christ suffered for us, and fulfilled the law for us, and took away its right of condemnation, can evil then any longer condemn, and can good save us? Therefore we who have faith, are in the full liberty of thinking, willing, speaking, and doing whatever we please, provided we do no injury to our reputation, honor, and interest, nor incur the penalties of the civil law, which would be a disgrace and hurt to us.” Some, who wander further north, said that good works, which are done for the sake of salvation, are hurtful, pernicious and cursed; among these, also, there were some presbyters."

[2] By “the works of men’s hands,” in the Word, in its natural sense, are meant graven images, molten images, and idols; but in the spiritual sense, by them are signified evils and falsities of every kind, which are man’s own things; as in these passages: Provoke me not to anger by the works of your hands; if ye provoke me to anger by the works of your hands, to your own evil, I will recompense them according to their works, and according to the deeds of their hands (Jer. 25:6–7, 14). The sons of Israel provoked me to anger by the works of their hands (Jer. 32:30; 44:8). I will speak judgments with them touching all their wickedness, that they have bowed themselves down to the works of their hands (Jer. 1:16)."

[3] That “the work of a man’s hands” is his proprium, and the evil and falsity thence, may be manifestly evident from this, that for that reason it was prohibited to build the altar and the temple of hewn stones, and to lift up a tool of iron upon those stones; for by this “the work of man’s hands” was signified. If thou makest an altar of stones unto me, thou shalt not build them hewn; because if thou movest a chisel upon it, thou wilt profane it (Exod. 20:25). Joshua built an altar of stones, upon which he did not move any iron (Josh. 8:30–31). The temple of Jerusalem was built of whole stone, and neither hammer nor axe nor any instruments of iron were heard when it was building (1 Kings 6:7). [4] All things also which are done by the Lord, are called “the works of his hands”; which are his own and in themselves goods and truths; as in these places: The works of the hands of Jehovah are truth and judgment (Ps. 111:7).

There is also a conjunction between them and such men; for every man is conjoined with spirits as to his affections, even so that they make a one; from which it is evident, that to “adore” demons, is to sacrifice to those lusts from the love of them. Therefore he who invokes faith alone, as the head of his religion, or as his idol, remains in evil, by reason of his not searching out any evil in himself which he calls a sin, and consequently is not desirous of removing it by repentance; and as every evil is composed of lusts, being nothing but a bundle of lusts, it follows, that he who does not search out any evil in himself, and shun it as a sin against God, which can only be done by repentance, becomes a demon after death. [2] Nothing but such lusts are signified by “demons” in the following passages: They sacrifice to demons, not to God (Deut. 32:17). The sons of Israel shall no longer sacrifice to demons, after which they have committed whoredom (Lev. 17:7; Ps. 106:37). The Ziim shall meet with the Ijim, and the demon of the woods shall meet with his companion (Isa. 34:14). The Ziim shall lie there, and their houses shall be full of Ochim, and the daughters of the owl shall dwell there, and the demons of the woods shall dance there (Isa. 13:21). By “Ziim,” “Ijim,” “Ochim,” “the daughters of the owl,” are signified various lusts; “wood demons” are such lusts as appertain to priapuses and satyrs: Babylon is become the habitation of demons, and the hold of every unclean spirit (Rev. 18:2)."

Moreover, the material of which idols were made, their forms, and their garments, among the ancients, represented the falsities of religion, from which was their worship: “idols of gold” signified falsities concerning Divine things; “idols of silver,” falsities concerning spiritual things; “idols of brass,” falsities concerning charity; “idols of stone,” falsities concerning faith; and “idols of wood,” falsities concerning good works. All these falsities exist in those who do not do the work of repentance, that is, shun evils as sins against God. [2] These things are signified in the spiritual sense by idols which were graven images and molten images, in the following passages: Every man has become foolish by knowledge, every founder is affected with shame by his graven image, because his molten image is a lie, neither is there breath in them; they are vanity, a work of errors; in the time of their visitation they shall perish (Jer. 10:14–15; 51:17–18). The graven images are the work of the hands of the workman; they speak not; they are infatuated and grow foolish together; the wood is a teaching of vanities; they all are the work of the wise (Jer. 10:3–5, 8–10). What profiteth the graven image, that the maker and teacher of lies has graven it; that the maker of a lie has trusted in it? there is no breath in the midst of it (Hab. 2:18–19). In that day a man shall cast away his idols of silver and his idols of gold, which they made for themselves to bow themselves down to, to the moles and to the bats (Isa. 2:18, 20)."

[3] Nor is anything but the falsities of religion and thence of worship signified by: The gods of gold, of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone, which Belshazzar, king of Babylon, praised (worshiped), when he drank wine with his magnates, wives, and concubines out of the vessels of gold and silver of the temple of Jerusalem; for which the king was driven out from man and became like a beast (Dan. 5:1–5 seq.); besides many other places (as Isaiah 10:10, 11; 21:9; 31:7; 40:19, 20; 41:29; 42:17; 48:5; Jeremiah 8:19; 50:38, 39; Ezekiel 6:4, 5; 14:3–6; Micah 1:7; 5:13; Psalms 115:4, 5; 135:15, 16; Leviticus 26:30).

They speak not, neither do they walk (Jer. 10:3–10). They have a mouth but they speak not, eyes have they but they see not (Ps. 115:5; 135:15–16).

Faith alone induces stupidity, tergiversation, and hardness in the hearts of those who are in the churches of the Reformed, because the good of life is not the religion where faith alone prevails; and if the good of life is not the religion, then the second table of the Decalogue, which is the table of repentance, is like an erased tablet on which no writing appears. That the second table of the Decalogue is a table of repentance, is evident, because it is not there said that good works are to be done, but that evil works are not to be done, as, “Thou shalt not kill,” “thou shalt not commit whoredom,” “thou shalt not steal,” “thou shalt not bear false witness,” “thou shalt not"

Since at this day it is not known what is meant by “enchantments,” it shall briefly be explained. “Enchantments” are mentioned in the above passage, in place of the eighth precept of the Decalogue, “Thou shalt not bear false witness,” for the three other evils, which are “murder,” “whoredom,” and “thefts,” are there named. “To bear false witness” signifies, in the natural sense, to act the part of a false witness, to lie and defame; and in the spiritual sense, to confirm and persuade that falsity is truth, and that evil is good; from which it is evident, that by “to enchant” is signified to persuade to what is false, and thus to destroy truth. [2] Enchantments were in use among the ancients, and were performed in three ways: First, they kept the hearing and thus the mind of another continually intent upon his words and sayings, without relaxing anything from them; and, at the same time, aspiring and inspiring thought conjoined with affection, by means of the breath, into the sound of the speech, whereby the hearer could not think anything from himself; thus the falsifiers poured in their falsities with violence. Secondly, they infused a persuasion, which was done by detaining the mind from everything contrary, and keeping the attention exclusively to the idea of that which was said by them, hence the spiritual sphere of his mind dispelled the spiritual sphere of the mind of the other, and stifled it. This was the spiritual fascination which the magi of old used, and which was called the binding and tying of the understanding. This kind of enchantment pertained only to the spirit or thought, but the former to the lips or speech also. [3] Thirdly, the hearer kept his mind so fixed in his own opinion, that he almost shut his ears against hearing anything from the speaker, which was done by holding the breath, and sometimes by"

This kind of enchantment was practiced by those who heard others, but the two former by those who spoke to others. These three kinds of enchantment prevailed among the ancients, and prevail still among infernal spirits; but with men in the world there remains only the third kind, and this with those who, from the pride of their own intelligence, have confirmed in themselves the falsities of religion; for these, when they hear things contrary, admit them no further into their thought than to mere contact, and then from the interior recess of their mind they emit as it were fire which consumes them, about which the other knows nothing except by indications from the countenance and the sound of the voice in the reply; provided the enchanter does not, by dissimulation, restrain that fire, or what is the same, the anger of his pride. This kind of enchantment operates at the present day to prevent truths from being accepted, and, with many, to their not being understood. [4] That in ancient times many magical arts prevailed, and among these enchantments, is evident from Moses: When thou shalt come into the land, thou shalt not learn to do according to the abominations of those nations; there shall not be found in thee one that passeth his son or his daughter through the fire; a diviner by divination, a magician and a soothsayer, a sorcerer, and an enchanter of enchantment, and one that interrogateth a python, and an augur, and one that inquireth of the dead; for all these are an abomination to Jehovah (Deut. 18:9–11). The persuasion of falsity, and thus the destruction of truth, are signified by “enchantments” in these passages: Thy wisdom and thy knowledge hath seduced thee; therefore shall evil come upon thee; persist in thine enchantments, and in the multitude of thy divinations (Isa. 47:10–12). All nations were seduced by the enchantment of Babylon (Rev. 18:23). Without shall stand dogs, enchanters, whoremongers, murderers (Rev. 22:15)."

[5] That “enchantment,” on the other hand signifies the rejection of falsity by truths, which was also done by tacitly thinking and muttering from a zeal for truth against falsity, is manifest from these passages: Jehovah will remove out of Zion the mighty, the man of war, the counselor, the learned in muttering, the skilful in enchantment (Isa. 3:1–3).

The father tortoises had two heads, the one large, covered over with a shell similar to the shell of their body, whence they had a reddish glow; and the other small, such as tortoises have, which they drew back into the front parts of the body, and also to insert in an unobserved manner in the larger head.

They said from heaven, that “this also is permitted them; because God, in him who has once been purified and so justified, does not look at anything of his thought and will; and that he still retains in the interior bosom or higher region of the mind or nature the faith which he had received in its first operation; and that that operation may sometimes return, when the man does not know it.

But because they speak concerning these things from the Word, especially concerning the Gospel, the operation of the Holy Spirit, and salvation, agreeably and elegantly, they therefore appear before their hearers as handsome men, and as wise above all others in the whole world.

Does a man know the interior operations of his speech, as how the lungs draw in the air, and fill the vesicles, the bronchia, and the lobes with it; how it emits this air into the trachea, and there turns it into sound; how that sound is modified in the glottis by the help of the larynx; and how the tongue then articulates it, and the lips complete the articulation, so that it becomes speech? All these interior operations, of which the man knows nothing, are they not for the sake of the outermost, that man may be able to speak? Remove or separate one of those internal things from its continuous connection with the outermosts, could the man speak any more than a stock? [9] “Take another example. The two hands are the ultimates of man. Are there not interiors, which are continued thither? They are from the head through the neck, then through the breast, the shoulders, the arms, and the forearms; and there are the innumerable muscular textures, the numberless orders of the moving fibers, the innumerable bundles of the nerves and blood vessels, and the many connections of the bones with their membranes and ligaments. Does man know anything concerning these? and yet his hands are operated from all of them. Suppose that those interiors around the elbow were turned to the left, and did not enter the hand; would not the hand from the elbow pine away, and go to decay like something torn off without life? Indeed, if you are willing to believe it, it would be as with the body, if the man were beheaded. It would be altogether similar with the will and thought of man, if the Divine operation should cease before it reaches them, and not flow into them. These things are according to reason."

THE EXPLANATION 464. In this and the following chapter the Lord is treated of, that he is the God of heaven and earth, and that as to his human also he is God; consequently that he is Jehovah himself. That this is the subject treated of in these two chapters, may be seen from the particulars in the spiritual sense, and from their conclusion (chapter 11:15–17). 465. Verse 1. And I saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven signifies the Lord in Divine majesty and power. That this “angel” is the Lord is evident from the description of him, as being “encompassed with a cloud, a rainbow over his head, his face as the sun, his feet like columns of fire,” and that he set his feet upon the sea and upon the earth; as also that he cried with a great voice as a lion roareth, and spoke as thunder. He was seen as an angel, because he appears as an angel in the heavens and below the heavens, when he manifests himself; for he fills some angel with his Divine in accommodation to the reception of those to whom he grants to see him. His presence itself, such as he is in himself or in his own essence, cannot be supported by any angel, much less by any man; wherefore he appears above the heavens as a sun, at a distance from the angels, as the sun of this world is from men. There he dwells in his Divine from eternity, and at the same time in his Divine human, which are a one like soul and body. He is here called “a mighty angel” from his Divine power; and it is said, “another angel” by reason of another Divine attribute of his, different from the former, being here described. 466. Encompassed with a cloud; and a rainbow was over his head signifies his Divine natural and Divine spiritual. By “the cloud” with which he was encompassed is signified the Divine natural;"

By “the rainbow” is signified the Divine spiritual, and as this is above the natural, therefore the rainbow appeared over the head. It is to be known, that the Lord is present with men in his Divine natural, but, with the angels of his spiritual kingdom, in his Divine spiritual, and with the angels of his celestial kingdom, in his Divine celestial; still he is not divided, but appears to everyone according to his quality. The Lord’s Divine spiritual is also signified by the rainbow in Ezekiel: And above the expanse of the cherubim was the likeness of a throne, and upon it the appearance of a man; and from the fire of his loins there was as it were the appearance of the rainbow which is in the cloud in the day of rain, this was the appearance of the glory of Jehovah (Ezek. 1:26–28). By “the throne” is signified heaven; by “the man upon it” the Lord; by “the fire of the loins” celestial love; and by “the rainbow” Divine truth spiritual, which also is of his Divine wisdom. It is written in Moses: I have set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a sign of the covenant between me and the earth, and when I shall see it in the cloud, I will remember the eternal covenant (Gen. 9:12-17). By “the rainbow” here nothing else is meant but the Divine truth spiritual in the natural with the man who is regenerated; for man, when he is regenerated, from natural becomes spiritual; and in as much as there is then a conjunction of the Lord with him, therefore it is said, that the bow in the cloud should be for “a sign of the covenant.” “Covenant” signifies conjunction. That there is no conjunction of the Lord with man by rainbows in the world is evident. 467. And his face was as the sun signifies the Divine love, and at the same time the Divine wisdom, as is evident from the explanation above (n. 53); where the same is said of the son of man."

This also appears from the explanation above (n. 49), where it is said of the son of man, that “his feet were like fine brass, as if glowing in a furnace.” The reason why his feet seemed like “pillars of fire” is because the Lord’s Divine natural, which in itself is the Divine human which he assumed in the world, sustains his Divine from eternity, as the body does the soul, and in like manner as the natural sense of the Word sustains its spiritual and celestial sense; on which subject see Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Sacred Scripture (n. 27–49). That “the feet” signify the natural, may be seen (n. 49); and that “a pillar” signifies support (n. 191). “Fire” signifies love, because spiritual fire is nothing else; therefore it is customary in worship to pray, that “heavenly fire may kindle the heart”; that is, celestial love. That there is a correspondence between fire and love, may be known from this: that man grows warm from love, and grows cold from the privation thereof, there being nothing else that produces vital heat, but love in both senses. The origin of correspondences is from two suns, one in the heavens which is pure love, and the other in the world which is pure fire; hence, also, is derived the correspondence between all spiritual and natural things. [2] Since “fire” signifies the Divine love, therefore: Jehovah was seen by Moses upon Mount Horeb in a bush on fire (Exod. 3:1–3). And he came down on Mount Sinai in fire (Deut. 4:36). And therefore: The seven lamps of the lampstand in the tabernacle were kindled every evening, that they might burn before Jehovah (Lev. 24:2–4). Also that the fire burned perpetually upon the altar, and was not extinguished (Lev. 6:13)."

That fire from heaven consumed the burnt offerings upon the altar, as a sign of good pleasure (Lev. 9:24; 1 Kings 18:38). That the burnt offerings were called offerings by fire to Jehovah, and the offerings by fire for an odor of rest to Jehovah (Exod. 29:18; Lev. 1:9, 13, 17; 2:2, 9–11; 3:5, 16; 4:31, 35; 5:12; 6:18; 21:6; Num. 28:2; Deut. 18:1).

Hence it is manifest what is signified by: The lamps with oil and without oil (Matt. 25:1–11). By “the oil” is meant fire, and thus love. Besides many other places. That “fire” in the opposite sense signifies infernal love is manifest from so many places in the Word that it is needless to adduce them on account of their abundance: see something on this subject in the work Heaven and Hell, published at London (n. 566–575). 469.

[2] “The little book” is said “to be open” because that doctrine appears manifestly in the Word, and is evident to everyone who reads it, if he attends. This is the subject now treated of, because it is the very essential of the new church. The reason is because on the knowledge and acknowledgment of God depends the salvation of everyone; for, as was observed in the preface, “The whole heaven, and the whole church on earth, and, in general, all religion is founded on a just idea of God; because by it there is conjunction, and by conjunction light, wisdom, and eternal happiness.” [3] Since the Lord is the very God of heaven and earth, therefore, no one who does not acknowledge him is admitted into heaven, for heaven is his body; but he stands below, and is bitten by serpents, that is, by infernal spirits, for whose bite there is no cure but that which the sons of Israel experienced by looking up to “the brazen serpent” (Num. 21:1–9); by which is meant the Lord as to the Divine human, as is plain from this passage in John: As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the son of man be lifted up; that whosoever believeth in him, should not perish, but have eternal life (John 3:14–15). 470. And he set his right foot upon the sea, and his left upon the earth signifies that the Lord has the whole church, as well those therein who are in its externals, as those who are in its internals, under his auspices and dominion. By “the sea and the earth” is signified the entire church; by “the sea” the external church, that is, they who are in its externals; and by “the earth” the internal church, that is, they who are in its internals (n. 398). By “setting his feet upon them” is signified to hold all in subjection to himself, consequently, under his Divine auspices and dominion. Since the Lord’s church on earth is beneath the heavens, therefore it is called “the footstool of his feet” as in these passages:"

Verse 3. And cried with a great voice, as a lion roareth signifies grievous lamentation that the church has been taken away from him. That by “crying as a lion roareth” is signified grievous lamentation respecting the church, and that it has been taken away from him is evident from what is explained in the foregoing chapter, where the states of life of those who are of the church were explored and made manifest, which were lamentable; also from its being said in this chapter, that “the angel swore by him that liveth for ages of ages, that there should be time no longer,” by which is signified that there would be no church; and, in the following chapter, that “the beast, which came up out of the abyss, killed his two witnesses”; and especially from his not being acknowledged and approached, although he is the God of heaven and earth. Lamentation concerning these things is signified by “his roaring as a lion,” for a lion roars when he sees his enemies and is assaulted by them, and when he sees his whelps and prey taken away; so does the Lord, comparatively, when he sees his church taken away from him by devils."

The anger of Jehovah was kindled against his people, his roaring is like a lion’s, he roareth like the young lions, and he growleth and seizeth the prey; for, behold, darkness, anxiety, and the light is darkened in the ruins thereof (Isa. 5:25–30).

That a voice from heaven is heard as thunder, when from the Lord is evident from these passages: Jesus said, Father, glorify thy name: and there came forth a voice out of heaven, and said, I have glorified it, and I will glorify it: the multitude heard this as thunder (John 12:28-30).

The reason is because by “the dragon,” “the beast,” and “the false prophet” are signified they who are in faith separated from charity, and these constantly and tenaciously adhere to their belief, that God the Father is to be approached, and not the Lord immediately, and that the Lord is not the God of heaven and earth as to his human; therefore if the above-mentioned doctrine (n. 472), which has been manifested and is still being manifested, which is signified by “the little book was opened,” were to be received by any others than those who are in charity and its faith, who also are those who are signified by “John” (n. 5, 17), before the dragon is cast out, it would be rejected not only by them, but also through them, by the rest; and if not rejected, still it would be falsified, yea, profaned. [2] That this is the case, evidently appears from what now follows in Revelation, when seen in its series, as, that they killed the Lord’s two witnesses (Rev. 11:7); that the dragon stood by the woman who was about to be delivered, that he might devour her offspring; and after he had fought with Michael he persecuted the woman (Rev. 12:1–17); and that the two beasts which came up, one out of the sea, and the other out of the earth, made one with him (Rev. 13:1–18); as also that he gathered together his followers to battle at the place called Armageddon (Rev. 16:16); and, finally, that they assembled the nations, Gog and Magog, to war (Rev. 20:8, 9). But that the dragon, the beast, and the false prophet, were cast into the lake of fire and brimstone (Rev. 20:10); and this being effected, the new church, which is to be the Lamb’s wife, came down out of heaven (Rev. 21–22).

It is said that “Jehovah hath sworn” because the church instituted among the sons of Israel was a representative church, and the Lord’s conjunction with the church was thence represented by a covenant, such as is made between two who swear to their compact; therefore, because an oath was a part of the covenant, it is said that “Jehovah swore”; by which, nevertheless, it is not meant that he swore, but that the Divine truth testifies it. [3] That an oath was a part of a covenant, appears from these passages: I have sworn unto thee, and entered into a covenant, and thou shouldest be mine (Ezek. 16:8). To remember the covenant, the oath which he swore (Luke 1:72–73; Ps. 105:9; Jer. 11:5; 32:22; Deut. 1:34; 10:11; 11:9, 21; 26:3, 15; 31:20; 34:4). As a covenant was a representative of the conjunction of the Lord with the church, and, reciprocally, of the church with the Lord; and as the oath was a part of the covenant, and man was to swear from the truth therein, thus also by it, therefore the sons of Israel were permitted to swear by Jehovah, and thus by the Divine truth (Exodus 20:7; Leviticus 19:12; Deuteronomy 6:13; 10:20; Isaiah 48:1; 65:16; Jeremiah 4:2; Zechariah 5:4); but after the representatives of the church were abrogated, the oaths of a"

Who created heaven, and the things that therein are, and the earth, and the things that therein are, and the sea, and the things that are therein signifies who vivifies all that are in heaven and that are in the church, and each and every thing in them. By “creating” in the natural sense is signified to create; but, in the spiritual sense, by “creating” is signified to reform and regenerate (n. 254, 290), which is also to vivify. By “heaven” is meant heaven where the angels are; by “the earth and the sea” is signified the church; by “the earth,” they who are in its internals, and by “the sea,” they who are in its externals (n. 398, 470). By “the things that are therein” are signified each and all the things with them. 476. That there should be time no longer signifies that there cannot be any state of the church, nor any church, unless one God be acknowledged, and that the Lord is he. By “time” is signified state; and, because the church is here treated of, the state of the church is signified. Therefore “there shall be time no longer” signifies that there will not be any state of the church. That it also means that there is not any church, unless one God be acknowledged, and that the Lord is he, follows as a consequence. But what is the case at this day? That there is one God is not denied, but that the Lord is he is denied; and yet there is not one God, in whom is the trinity at the same time, but the Lord. That the church is from him, who is the savior and redeemer is not denied; but that he, as the savior and redeemer, ought to be approached immediately is denied. Hence it is evident, that the church is about to expire, unless a new one comes into existence, which acknowledges the Lord alone to be the God of heaven and earth, and, for this reason, immediately approaches him (see Matthew 28:18). Therefore these words, “there shall be time no longer,” that is, there shall be no church, relate to what follows in this chapter (verse 7); and this again, to what is written in chapter 11 (verse 15); where it is said there will be a church which will be from the Lord alone."

The reason why the state of the church is here meant by “time” is because day and night, morning and evening, summer and winter, constitute time in this world, and when understood in the spiritual sense, they constitute the states of the church; therefore when these states no longer exist, there is no church; and there is then no church, when there is no longer any good and truth, thus when the light of truth is thick darkness, and the heat of good is cold; this is what is meant by “there is time no longer.” Something similar is meant by the following passages in the Word: The fourth beast will think to change the times (Dan. 7:25). But it shall be one day which is known to Jehovah, not day nor night (thus no time) (Zech. 14:7). I will cause the sun to set at noon, and I will darken the earth in the day of light (thus there would be no time) (Amos 8:9). Behold, one evil is come, the end is come, the end is come, the morning is come upon thee, O thou that dwellest in the land, the time is come (Ezek. 7:5–7). “The morning” is the beginning of a new church (n. 151), therefore it is said “the time is come.” 477. Verse 7. But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he is about to sound signifies the final exploration and manifestation of the state of the church, which must perish, unless the new one be established by the Lord. That by “sounding a trumpet” is signified to explore and manifest the state of life of those who are of the church, consequently the state of the church, may be seen above (n. 397); and seven angels sounded, by “the voice of the seventh angel” is signified the final exploration and manifestation,"

The mystery of God shall be finished; as he hath declared to his servants the prophets signifies that then it will appear that it is foretold in the Word of both testaments, but has hitherto been hidden, that after the last judgment is executed upon those who have devastated the church, the Lord’s kingdom will come. By “being finished” is signified to be fulfilled, to have an end, and then to appear. By “the mystery of God declared to the prophets” is signified that which is foretold by the Lord in the Word, and hitherto hidden. By “declaring” (evangelizing) is signified to announce the Lord’s advent and his kingdom, for the gospel is a glad messenger. That this will come to pass, after the last judgment is executed upon those who have devastated the church is also foretold in the Word, therefore this also is signified. From this it may appear that all these are meant by these words. [2] Something shall first be said of what is foretold in the Word of both testaments, concerning the coming of the Lord, and his kingdom. In the Word of the Old Testament, which is called prophetic in the spiritual sense, and also where this sense shines forth in the natural sense, the Lord alone is treated of, that is to say, his advent in the fullness of time; which is when there is no longer any good of charity and truth of faith in the church, which state of the church is called the consummation, devastation, desolation, and decision. It also treats of his combats with the hells and victories over them, which likewise constitute the last judgment executed by him; and afterwards of the creation of a new heaven, and the establishment of a new church, which are the Lord’s kingdom that is to come. These things are also treated of in the Word of the New Testament, which is called apostolic, and particularly in Revelation."

[4] This mystery is described in Daniel almost in the same manner as here in Revelation, where are these words: I heard the man clothed in linen, that he lifted up his hands to heaven, and swore by him that liveth forever, that it should be unto the stated time of stated times and a half, when all these things should be finished: but he said, Go, Daniel, because the words are shut up and sealed even to the time of the end (Dan. 12:7, 9). “Even to the time of the end” is even to this time. That then the son of man will take the kingdom he foretells in these words: I saw in the vision of the night, and behold, there was one like the son of man coming with the clouds of heaven; and to him was given dominion, and glory, and a kingdom; and all peoples, nations, and tongues shall worship him. His dominion is the dominion of an age which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not perish (Dan. 7:13–14). [5] That “to declare good tidings” [evangelize] signifies the Lord’s coming and his kingdom at that time is manifest from these passages: O Zion, that declarest good tidings, get thee up upon the mountain: O Jerusalem, that declarest good tidings, lift up thy voice with strength; say, Behold your God; behold the Lord Jehovih cometh in strength, and his arm shall rule for him (Isa. 40:9–10).

The spirit of the Lord Jehovih is upon me, therefore Jehovah hath anointed me to declare good tidings to the poor, to preach liberty to the captives, to proclaim the year of the good pleasure of Jehovah (Isa. 61:1–2). The angel said to Zechariah, Behold, thy wife shall bring forth a son, who shall go forth before the Lord God in the spirit and power of Elias, and to prepare the people for the Lord. I am Gabriel, and I was sent to declare to thee this good tidings (Luke 1:13, 17, 19). The angel said to the shepherds, Fear not; behold, I declare to you good tidings of great joy; for unto you is born this day in the city of David a savior who is Christ the Lord (Luke 2:10–11). The Lord declared the glad tidings of the kingdom of God (Matt. 4:23; 9:35; Mark 1:15; Luke 7:22; 8:1; 9:1–2). John the Baptist also (Luke 3:18).

For it was not fulfilled by the Jews, because they did not acknowledge the Lord. Nor was it fulfilled by the Christians, for neither did they acknowledge the Lord as the God of heaven and earth even as to his human; for they make this like the human of another man: wherefore they do not go immediately to him; when yet he is Jehovah, who came into the world."

By “the voice which he heard from heaven” now again speaking with him is meant the voice which said to him to seal up the things which the seven thunders uttered, and not to write them (verse 4), by which is signified that the doctrine concerning the Lord would not be received till after they who are meant by “the dragon,” “the beast,” and “the false prophet” should be cast out of the world of spirits, because there would be danger were it to be received before, as may be seen above (n. 473). That this is the case is now made manifest by John, by his “eating up the little book,” as presently follows. That by “the little book” is meant the doctrine concerning the Lord, may be seen (n. 469, 472); and that by “the angel standing upon the sea and upon the earth” is meant the Lord (n. 465, 470). 480.

By “taking the little book,” is signified to receive the doctrine concerning the Lord; by “eating it up” is signified to acknowledge it; by “making the belly bitter” is signified that it will be disagreeable and difficult from falsifications, for “bitter” signifies truth falsified (n. 411); by “being in the mouth sweet as honey” is signified that the beginning of its reception is agreeable and pleasant.

The falsifications, by which that doctrine is perceived as disagreeable and difficult are especially that the Lord is not acknowledged to be one with the Father, although he himself so taught; they have not acknowledged the Lord’s human to be Divine, which, nevertheless is the son of God (Luke 1:35); and thus it may be said, that they have made God three, and the Lord two; besides the falsities continued from them: from these falsities flows faith alone, and faith alone afterwards confirms those falsities.

To prophesy signifies to teach (n. 8, 133), therefore “to prophesy again” signifies to teach further; by “peoples” are signified those who are in the truths or the falsities of doctrine; and by “nations,” those who are in the goods or the evils of life, as will be seen presently; by “tongues” are signified those who are exteriorly in them (n. 282); and by “kings” are signified those who are interiorly in them; for by “kings” are signified those who are in truths from good; and, in the opposite sense, those who are in falsities derived from evil, and, abstractly, truths from good or falsities from evil, as may be seen (n. 20, 664, 704, 720, 830, 921); and since they who are in interior falsities are specifically treated of in what follows, it is said, “and many kings,” by whom are signified falsities of evil in abundance. “Peoples,” “nations,” “tongues,” and “kings” are mentioned that all who are such in the church may be meant. John being told that “he must prophesy again” signifies that it is necessary to teach further what is the quality of those who are in faith alone, to the end that their falsities may be disclosed and thus abolished; inasmuch as no falsity is abolished before it is disclosed. [2] That “peoples” signify those who are in truths or falsities of doctrine, and “nations” those who are in goods or in evils of life, may appear from many passages in the Word, where “peoples” and “nations” are mentioned; but in confirmation of this, only those passages shall be here adduced, where “peoples” and “nations” are mentioned together, from which this may be concluded, since in the Word in each and every thing there is a marriage of the Lord and the church, and thence a marriage of good and truth; and “peoples” relate to truth, and “nations” to good.

On which account I approached the place where that sound was heard; and when I was near, the sound died away; and I then saw a kind of arched roof above the earth, the entrance to which was through a cave. Seeing which, I descended and entered. And behold there was a chamber, in which I saw an old man sitting among books, holding before him the Word, and seeking therefrom what might be serviceable for his doctrine. Scraps of paper lay around, on which he wrote down what served him. There were scribes in an adjoining room, who gathered up the papers, and copied them upon an entire sheet. I asked first about the books around him.

Afterwards he said to me that he was now collecting from the Word this first point of justifying faith, that God the Father fell away from grace towards the human race on account of their iniquities; and that it was therefore a Divine necessity for the saving of men, that satisfaction, reconciliation, propitiation, and mediation should be made by some one, who should take upon himself the condemnation of justice; and this could by no means be done but by his only son; and that after this was done, access to God the Father was open for his sake. And he said, “I see and have seen, that this is according to all reason. How otherwise could God the Father be approached, except through faith in that merit of the son? I have now found also, that this is likewise according to Scripture.” [2] I heard this, and was astounded that he should say that it was according to reason and according to Scripture, when yet it is contrary to reason and contrary to Scripture; which I also told him plainly. He then rejoined in the wrath of his zeal, “How can you speak so?” Wherefore I opened my mind, saying, “Is it not contrary to reason to think that God the Father fell away from grace towards the human race, and rejected it? “Is not the Divine grace an attribute of the Divine essence? Wherefore, to fall away from grace would be to fall away from his Divine essence; and to fall away from his Divine essence, would be to be no longer God. Can God be alienated from himself? Believe me, that grace on the part of God, as it is infinite, is also eternal. The grace of God may be lost on the part of man, if he does not receive it; but never on the part of God. If grace should recede from God, there would be an end of the entire heaven and with it the entire human race, insomuch that man would no longer be man in any respect; for which reason grace on the part of God endures forever, not only towards angels and men, but also towards the devil himself. Since this is according to reason, why do you say that the only access to God the Father is through faith in the son’s merit, when yet there is perpetual access through grace?"

He said that they were the wisest of the wise, who decide among themselves concerning supernatural things. He spoke thus from his simple belief. And I asked whether it was permitted to enter. He said that it was, “provided you say nothing. I may admit you, because I have leave to admit Gentiles, who stand with me at the door.” I therefore entered; and behold, it was a circus, and in the midst of it a pulpit; and an assembly of the wise, and thus of the learned, were discussing the arcana of faith. And the matter or proposition then submitted for discussion was, whether the good which a man does in the state of justification by faith, or in the progression of it after the act is the good of religion or not. They said unanimously, that by the good of religion was meant the good which contributes to salvation. [8] The discussion was sharp; but those prevailed who said that the goods which a man does in the state or in the progression of faith, are only moral, civil, and political goods, which contribute nothing to salvation; but that faith only can do this. And they confirmed it thus. “How can any work of man be conjoined with free grace? Is not salvation of free grace? How can any good of man be conjoined with Christ’s merit? Is not salvation by that alone? And how can man’s operation be conjoined with the operation of the Holy Spirit? Does not this do all, without the man’s help? Are not these three things alone saving in the act of faith? And these three things also remain as alone saving in the state or progression of faith. For which reason accessory good from the man can by no means be called the good of religion, which, as was said, contributes to salvation. But if one does this for the sake of salvation, it is rather to be called the evil of religion.” [9] Two Gentiles were standing in the entry near the doorkeeper; and they heard these things, and said to each other, “These people have not any religion. Who does not see that to do good to the neighbor for the sake of God, and thus with God, and from God is what is called religion?” And the other said, “Their faith hath infatuated them.” And they then asked the doorkeeper, “Who are"

That it is the faculty and power of knowing and seeing the state of the church in heaven and in the world, is plain from what follows in this chapter to the end. [2] That by “a reed” or cane, is signified feeble power, such as man has from himself, is evident from these passages: Lo, thou trustest in the staff of a broken reed, on Egypt; on which when a man leans it will go into his hand, and pierce it (Isa. 36:6). And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know, that I am Jehovah, because they have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel; when they held thee by the hand thou didst break, and perforate all their shoulder (Ezek. 29:6–7).

[3] But by a “staff” is signified strong power, which is from the Lord; here of knowing the state of the church, because “the temple and altar were measured” with a staff; and by “measuring” is signified to know, and by “the temple and altar” is signified the church; as will be seen presently. “A staff” signifies power, because wood, of which staffs were made among the ancient people signifies good; and because it is instead of the right hand, and supports it, and by “the right hand” is signified power; hence it is that a scepter is a short staff and by “a scepter” is signified the power of a king; and a “scepter” and “staff” are the same word in the Hebrew language.

That by it Joshua with Moses prevailed over the Amalekites (Exod. 17:9–12). That fire went forth out of the rock by the staff of the angel (Judg. 6:21).

By “them that adore” is here signified adoration, which is worship, because the spiritual sense is abstracted from the persons (n. 78–79, 96); that this is the case in the present passage, is evident from this, that he was told “to"

[2] That it is the church in the new heaven which is meant, is plain from the last verse of this chapter, where it is said, that “the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in the temple the ark of the covenant” (verse 19). The reason why “the measuring the temple” is spoken of at the beginning of this chapter is in order that the state of the church in heaven, before it was brought into conjunction with the church in the world, might be seen and known. The church in the world is meant by “the court without the temple, which was not to be measured, because it was given to the gentiles” (verse 2); and then it is described by “the great city, which is called Sodom and Egypt” (verses 7, 8); but afterwards “that great city fell” (verse 13); it follows that the church “was become the Lord’s” (verse 15, and subsequent verses). It is to be known, that there is a church in the heavens as well as on earth; and that they make one, like the internal and external with man; wherefore the church in the heavens is first provided by the Lord, and from it, or by it, the church on earth; thence, it is said, that the new Jerusalem came down from God out of the new heaven (chapter 21:1, 2). By “the new heaven” is meant the new heaven from Christians, which is frequently treated of in the following pages. [3] “To measure” signifies to know and scrutinize the quality; because by “a measure” is signified the quality of a thing, or state; this is signified by all the measures of the new Jerusalem (chapter 21); and also by these words, which occur there: The angel having a golden reed, measured the city and the gates thereof; and he measured the wall, one hundred and forty-four cubits, the measure of a man, that is, of an angel (Rev. 21:15, 17). And as by “the new Jerusalem” in signified the new church, it is plain by “measuring” it and the things which are of it, is signified to know the quality. The same is signified by “measuring” in Ezekiel, where it is said that:"

He measured the waters (Ezek. 47:3–5). And therefore it is said: Show the form to the house of Israel, and let them be ashamed of their iniquities: and they shall measure the form and its exit and its entrance and all the forms of it, that they may guard all the form (Ezek. 43:10, 11). The same is signified by “measuring” in these places: I lifted up my eyes, and behold, a man, in whose hand was a measuring line; and I said, Whither goest thou? and he said, To measure Jerusalem (Zech. 2:1, 2). He stood and measured the earth (Hab. 3:6). The Lord Jehovah measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and meted out the heavens with the span, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance (Isa. 40:12). Where wast thou when I founded the earth? who set the measures of it? and who stretched out the line upon it (Job 38:4–5)? 487. Verse 2. But the court which is without the temple cast out, and measure it not signifies that the state of the church on earth, such as it is at present, is to be removed, and not to be known. By “the court without the temple” is signified the church on earth, this being out of heaven, that is, out of “the temple” (n. 486). By “casting it out” is signified to remove it, in this instance, from heaven, because such is its state; and by “not measuring” is signified not to scrutinize and know its quality (n. 486). The reason follows; “because it is given unto the gentiles, and the holy city shall they trample forty-two months.” That by “the court out of the temple” is here signified the church on earth such as it still is appears from what follows in this chapter, where it is described by “the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt” in which the Lord’s two witnesses lay killed, and which afterwards fell in a great"

And the holy city shall they trample forty-two months signifies that it would disperse every truth of the Word, even so that nothing would remain. By “the holy city” is meant the holy Jerusalem; and by “the holy Jerusalem” is meant the new church which is in truths of doctrine, for “holy” is predicated of the Divine truth (n. 173); and “a city” signifies doctrine (n. 194); therefore by “trampling” that metropolis or city is signified to disperse the truths of its doctrine; by “forty-two months” is signified until there is an end, when there is nothing left; by truths of doctrine are meant truths from the Word, because the doctrine of the church, and all that relates to it, is thence derived. That they who are, at this day, in the internals of the church, have so dispersed the truths of the Word, and thence the doctrines of the church, and everything of it, is described in this chapter by “the beast coming up out of the abyss,” in that “he killed the two witnesses” (verse 7), and may also be seen from the relations from the spiritual world, annexed to each chapter. [2] By “forty-two months” is signified even to the end, and till no truth and good of the church is left, because the same thing is signified by forty-two and by six weeks, for six times seven is forty- two, and by “six weeks” is signified what is complete even to the end; for “six” has this signification, and “a week” signifies state, and “the seventh week” a holy state, which is a new state of the church, when the Lord begins his reign. This number has a similar signification in the following passage: And there was given unto the beast which came up out of the sea a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies, and power was given unto him to continue forty-two months (Rev. 13:5).

Verse 3. And I will give unto my two witnesses signifies those who confess and acknowledge from the heart that the Lord is the God of heaven and earth, and that his human is Divine, and who are conjoined to him by a life according to the precepts of the Decalogue. The reason why these are here meant by “the two witnesses” is because these two are the two essentials of the new church. That the first essential, that the Lord is the God of heaven and earth, and that his human is Divine, is “a testimony,” and consequently, that they are “witnesses” who confess and acknowledge it in the heart, may be seen (n. 6, 846), and likewise from the following passages: I am the fellow servant of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus; for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy (Rev. 19:10). The angels of Michael overcame the dragon by the blood of the Lamb and by the Word of his testimony: and the dragon went away to make war with the rest of her seed, who kept the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ (Rev 12:11, 17). The souls of them that were smitten with the axe for the testimony of Jesus and for the Word of God (Rev. 20:4). These are they who acknowledged the Lord. This is called “the testimony of Jesus” because the Lord testifies it from his Word, thus from himself; on which account he is called: The faithful and true witness (Rev. 1:5; 3:14). And he says:"

When the Comforter, the Spirit of truth, is come, he shall testify of me (John 15:26). That the Comforter, the Spirit of truth, which is also the Holy Spirit, is the proceeding Divine, and that this is the Lord him-self, may be seen in Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Lord (n. 46–54). Now because the Lord himself is the Witness, therefore those also are meant by “witnesses” who testify this from the Lord, as John did: Jesus said, Ye sent unto John, and he was a witness to the truth; yet I receive not testimony from man (John 5:33–34). John came for a testimony, that he might testify concerning the light: he was not the light, but that he might testify of the light. The Word, which was with God, and which was God, was the true light (John 1:1–14, 34). [2] That the second essential of the new church, which is conjunction with the Lord by a life according to the precepts of the Decalogue, is “a testimony” is manifest from the fact that the Decalogue is called “the testimony”; as in these passages: Thou shalt put into the ark the testimony which I will give thee (Exod. 25:16). Moses put the testimony into the ark (Exod. 40:20). The mercy seat which is over the testimony (Lev. 16:13). Leave the staffs of the tribes before the testimony (Num. 17:4.

But who now is the one God? A trine or triune God is not one God when this trine and triune is in three persons; but he, in whom the trine or triune is in one person, is one God, and that God is the Lord. Entangle the ideas as far as you can, yet you will never be able to extricate the idea that God is one, unless he is also one person. That this is so, the whole Word teaches, both in the old prophetic, and in the new apostolic, as may be clearly seen from the Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Lord. 491. And they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and sixty days signifies that these two, the acknowledgment of the Lord, and a life according to the precepts of the Decalogue, which are the two essentials of the new church, are to be taught until the end and the beginning. That these two, the acknowledgment of the Lord, and a life according to the precepts of the Decalogue, are the two essentials of the new church, and are meant by “the two witnesses” may be seen above (n. 490); and that “to prophesy” signifies to teach (n. 8, 133). By “one thousand two hundred and sixty days” is signified until the end and the beginning, that is, until the end of the former church, thus to the beginning of the new. The reason why this is signified by this number is because it has the same signification as three and a half, and by three and a half is signified an end and a beginning (n. 505); for the number one thousand two hundred and sixty, when reduced into years, makes three years and a half. The like is signified by the same number in the next chapter: And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and sixty days (Rev. 12:6). 492.

The sons of Israel represented mourning by various things, which, from correspondences, were significative, as by putting ashes on the head, by rolling themselves in the dust, by sitting a long time silent upon the earth, by shaving themselves, by lamentation and howling, by rending the garments, and also by “putting on sackcloth,” besides other particulars; and each of these signified some evil of the church among them, for which they were punished; and when they were punished, they represented repentance by such things, and on account of the representation of repentance and then at the same time of humiliation they were heard. [2] That mourning on account of the devastation of truth in the church was represented by “putting on sackcloth” may be seen from the following passages: The lion is come up from the thicket, he has gone forth from his place to reduce the land to wasteness; for this gird you with sackcloth, lament, howl (Jer. 4:7, 8). O daughter of my people, gird thee with sackcloth, and roll thyself in ashes, for the waster shall suddenly come upon us (Jer. 6:26).

By “an olive tree” is signified love and charity, of which presently; and by “lamp stands” is signified enlightenment in truths (n. 43), and thence intelligence and faith, because intelligence is from enlightenment in truths, and faith is from this. By “standing before God” is signified to hear and do what he commands (n. 366), here therefore that these two are with them from the Lord, who is the God of the earth, that is, with those who are in the two essentials of the new church, spoken of above; from which it is plain, that by the two witnesses being “two olive trees and two lamp stands” is signified that they were love and intelligence, or charity and faith, for these two make the church; love and charity its life, and intelligence and faith its doctrine. [2] An olive signifies love and charity, because the olive tree signifies the celestial church, and thence “the olive,” which is its fruit signifies celestial love, which love is love to the Lord; hence it is that this love is also signified by the oil, by which all the holy things of the church were anointed. The oil, which was called the oil of holiness, was: From olives mixed with aromatics (Exod. 30:23–24).

And Jesus spoke with his disciples on that mount concerning the consummation of the age, and his coming at that time (Matt. 24:3, and following verses; Mark 13:3, and following verses).

Such things are said in the Word, because they are appearances; and the Word, in its literal sense, is written by correspondences and appearances.

But this passage is to be understood in the same manner as the former, viz., that they who would smite these two essentials of the new church with a plague, that is, destroy them, which is done by evil through falsities, will cast themselves into all kinds of evils and falsities; and as the natural sense is thus changed while it becomes spiritual, therefore also this expression, “as often as they will,” is changed in like manner into this, as often and so far as they do this. The reason is because in proportion as anyone destroys these two essentials, he so far destroys the truths of the Word; and so far as he destroys the truths of the Word, so far he casts himself into evils and falsities; for these two essentials are the truths of the Word, as may appear manifestly from the two doctrines of the new Jerusalem; one concerning the Lord, and the other concerning the doctrine of life from the precepts of the Decalogue. This passage, that “the witnesses had the power of smiting the earth with every plague as often as they will,” is similar to many others in the Word, which attribute to Jehovah, that is, to the Lord, that “he smites men with plagues,” and that this is his will, when yet it must be understood that he neither smites them, nor is it his will to do so, as in Zechariah: This shall be the plague with which Jehovah shall smite all the people that have fought against Jerusalem (Zech. 14:12, and following verses).

By “the beast that cometh up out of the abyss” are meant they who came up out of the abyss, and appeared like locusts (chap. 9:1–12).

[2] The reason why they who are principled in the internals of the doctrine of faith alone will impugn and reject these two essentials is because they have confirmed themselves in two things diametrically opposite to them: first, that it is not the Lord, but God the Father, who is to be approached; and second, that a life according to the precepts of the Decalogue is not a spiritual life, but only a moral and civil life, and this they confirm, lest anyone believe that he can be saved by works, but only by their faith. All they who have had these dogmas impressed deeply on their minds in schools and academies, do not recede from them afterwards. There are three reasons for this which hitherto have not been known: First, because they have entered, as to their spirit, into association with their like in the spiritual world, where there are many satans, who are delighted with nothing but falsities, from which they cannot at all be separated but by rejecting those falsities; nor can this be done but by immediately approaching God the savior, and beginning a Christian life according to the precepts of the Decalogue."

And because they know how to confirm such things subtly before the unlearned by falsifications of the Word, and before the learned by sophistry, it is here said that “the beast which came up from the abyss overcame and killed the two witnesses.” But this takes place only with those who love to follow their own inclinations, being borne along by the delights of their lusts. When these think about salvation, they cherish those lusts in their hearts and embrace their faith with both hands, thinking that they may be saved by uttering certain words with a tone of confidence, and that they need not attend to anything of their life for the sake of God, but only for the sake of the world. [4] The third reason is that they who, in youth, had imbibed the internals of that faith which are called the mysteries of justification, on being afterwards promoted to an honored ministry, do not think in themselves concerning God and heaven, but concerning themselves and the world, retaining only the mysteries of their faith for the sake of reputation, that they may be honored as wise, and by reason of their wisdom, be thought worthy of being rewarded with wealth. The reason why this is an effect of that faith is because there is nothing of religion in it. That this is so may be seen in the third relation above (n. 484). [5] That by “wars” in the Word, are signified spiritual wars, which are fightings against truth, and are effected by reasonings from falsities, is evident from these passages: Spirits of demons go forth to gather them to war in the great day of God almighty (Rev. 16:14).

The wars of the kings of the north, and of the south, and others, in Daniel (chapters 10, 11, 12) signify no other than spiritual wars; besides “the wars” mentioned in other places (as in Isaiah 2:3–5; 13:4; 21:14, 15; 31:4; Jeremiah 49:25, 26; Hosea 2:18; Zechariah 10:5; 14:3; Psalms 27:3; 46:8, 9). [6] Since by “wars” in the Word, are signified spiritual wars, therefore the ministry of the Levites was called “military service,” as appears from these things: It was commanded that the Levites should be numbered, to perform military service, to do work in the tent of the congregation (Num. 4:23, 35, 39, 43, 47)."

By “the bodies of the two witnesses” are signified the two essentials of the new church, which are the acknowledgment of the Lord as the only God of heaven and earth, and that conjunction with him is by a life according to the precepts of the Decalogue (n. 490, etc.). By “the street of the great city” is signified the falsity of the doctrine concerning justification by faith alone; by “a street” is signified falsity, as will be seen presently; and by “a city” is signified doctrine (n. 194). It is called “a great city” because it is the doctrine which reigns in the whole Reformed Christian world among the clergy, though not in like manner among the laity. By “streets” in the Word, almost the same is signified as by “ways,” because streets are ways in a city; but still by “streets” are signified the truths or falsities of doctrine, because “a city” signifies doctrine (n. 194); and by “ways” are signified the truths or falsities of the church, because “the earth” signifies the church (n. 285). That “streets” signify truths or falsities of doctrine, may be seen from the following passages: And judgment is rejected, and justice hath stood afar off: for truth is stricken in the street, and rectitude cannot come (Isa. 59:14). The chariots shall rage in the streets, they shall run to and fro in the broad ways (Nah. 2:4). In the days of Jael the ways ceased, the broad ways ceased in Israel (Judg. 5:6–7)."

By “fire and brimstone,” that love with its lusts is signified. I saw similar things happen when the cities and societies of such were overthrown in the day of the last judgment, and they were cast into hell. These loves and their evils are signified by “Sodom and Gomorrah” (in these places: Isaiah 1:10; 3:8–9; 13:19; Jeremiah 23:14; 49:18; 50:37, 40; Lamentations 4:6; Ezekiel 16:46–50; Amos 4:11; Zephaniah 2:9–10; Deuteronomy 29:23; 32:32; Matthew 10:14–15; 11:23; Mark 6:11; Luke 10:10–12; 17:28–29). [3] That this love is signified by “Sodom” is not known in the world; but keep this in mind and remember it when you come into the world of spirits, as is done after death, and you will be fully convinced. But it is to be known, that there is a love of dominating from self-love, and a love of dominion from the love of uses; the latter love is celestial, but the former infernal. Therefore when one makes the head, the other makes the feet, that is, when the love of dominating from self-love makes the head, then the love of dominion from the love of uses, which is also the love of serving the neighbor from the Lord, at first makes the feet, afterwards the soles of the feet, and lastly is trodden under foot. But when the love of dominion from the love of uses (which as was said, is celestial love) makes the head, then the love of dominating from self-love (which, as was observed, is an infernal love) at first makes the feet, afterwards the soles of the feet, and finally is trodden under foot. These two loves, however, are with difficulty distinguished by man in the world, because their external forms are similar; yet they may be distinguished by this, that the celestial love is with those who approach the Lord, and live according to the precepts of the Decalogue; and that the infernal love is with those who do not approach the Lord, and who do not live according to the precepts of the Decalogue. 503.

Egypt there is the natural, Assyria is the rational, and Israel is the spiritual; these three make the man of the church. Hence the king of Egypt was called “the son of the wise,” “the son of the kings of antiquity”; and Egypt was called “the cornerstone of the tribes” (Isaiah 19:11, 13); and it is said of Solomon that: His wisdom excelled the wisdom of the Egyptians (1 Kings 4:30).

It is said in the church, that they “crucify the Lord” who blaspheme him; as do those also who, like the Jews, deny him to be the son of God. The reason why they who deny the Lord’s human to be Divine are like the Jews is because every man regards the Lord as a man, and he who regards his human as like the human of another man cannot then think of his Divine, howsoever he may call this the son of God, born from eternity, and equal to the Divine of the Father. When it is spoken and read, it is heard indeed, but still it is not at the same time believed; when the Lord is thought of as a material man like any other man, and retaining the like properties of the flesh; and as his Divine is then removed and not regarded, therefore the same state is induced as if it were denied, for he denies that his human is the son of God, as did the Jews, for which reason they crucified him. That the Lord’s human is nevertheless the son of God, is openly said (in Luke 1:32, 35; Matt. 3:16–17; and in other places). [2] From these things it appears, why the men of the church approach God the Father immediately, and many also the Holy Spirit immediately, but scarcely anyone approaches the Lord immediately. Since the Jews, from the denial that the Lord was the messiah, the son of God, crucified him, therefore their Jerusalem is also called Sodom (Isa. 3:9; Jer. 23:14; Ezek. 16:46, 48). And the Lord says: On the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all; even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed (Luke 17:29–30).

Because these two prophets tormented them that dwell upon the earth signifies that these two essentials—one concerning the Lord and concerning the Divine human; and the other concerning a life according to the commandments of the Decalogue— are contrary to the two essentials received in the church of the Reformed, one of which relates to a trinity of persons, and the other to faith alone being saving without the works of the law, and that by reason of this contrariety, those two essentials of the new church, which is the new Jerusalem, are held in contempt, dislike, and aversion. That this is what is signified, when by “the two prophets” or “witnesses” are meant the two essentials of the new church, and when by “them that dwell upon the earth” are meant they who are in the two essentials of the church of the Reformed, follows as a necessary consequence; by “tormenting” is signified to be held in contempt, dislike, and aversion. 510.

By “standing upon their feet” is signified the external of man, which is called the external man, which is in itself natural; for the body speaks and acts what its spirit thinks and wills, and to speak and to act is natural; that feet signify things natural, may be seen (n. 49, 468). [2] What is specifically meant by this expression, shall be explained: Every man who is reformed is first reformed as to the internal man, and afterwards as to the external. The internal man is not reformed by merely knowing and understanding the truths and goods by which man is saved, but by willing and loving them; but the external man, by speaking and doing the things which the internal man wills and loves, and in proportion as this takes place, in the same proportion man is regenerated. The reason why he is not regenerated before is because his internal is not before in the effect, but only in the cause, and, unless the cause be in the effect, it is dissipated. It is like a house built upon ice, which sinks to the bottom when the ice is melted by the sun; in a word, it is like a man without feet to stand and walk upon. It is the same with the internal or spiritual man, if it is not founded on the external or natural man. Such then is the signification of “the two witnesses standing upon their feet after the spirit from God entered into them”; and also of similar expressions in Ezekiel: Jehovah said unto me, Prophesy unto the wind, and when I prophesied, the spirit entered into them, and they stood upon their feet (Ezek. 37:9–10). A voice speaking unto me, said, Son of man, stand upon thy feet; and the spirit entered into me and stood me upon my feet (Ezek. 2:1–2). I fell on my face, then the spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet (Ezek. 3:23–24). This is what is meant also by the Lord’s words to Peter:"

And great fear fell upon them that saw them signifies commotion of mind and consternation at Divine truths. “Fear” has various significations according to the thing which causes it; here “great fear” signifies commotion of mind, and consternation at Divine truths; for Divine truths have these effects with the evil, for they terrify them when at the same time they hear of hell and eternal damnation; but that terror soon vanishes, together with the faith that there is any life after death. 512. Verse 12. And they heard a great voice out of heaven, saying unto them, Come up hither signifies that these two essentials of the new church were taken up by the Lord into heaven, whence they came, and where they are, and the protection of them. By “a great voice from heaven” is signified from the Lord, for a voice from heaven is from no other source; “come up hither” signifies their being taken up into heaven, whence they came, and where they are, and their protection. 513. And they went up into heaven in a cloud signifies the taking them up into heaven, and conjunction there with the Lord by the Divine truth of the Word in its literal sense.

By “enemies” are meant “they who were in the great city, which is spiritually called Sodom and Egypt,” who were those that are in faith separated from charity, as may be seen above (n. 501, 502, and following numbers). 515. Verse 13. And in that hour there was a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell signifies a remarkable change of state then took place with them, and they were torn away from heaven and sank down into hell. “In that hour” signifies at the time when they saw “the two witnesses” ascend into heaven, and nevertheless they remained in their falsities as above (n. 514); for “the two witnesses prophesied,” that is, taught them (verse 3), and afterwards were killed, and revived; they also saw them ascend up to heaven, and still did not recede from their falsities, then there became a great earthquake. That a similar thing happened with the two doctrines of the new Jerusalem, one concerning the Lord, and the other concerning life according to the commandments of the Decalogue, may in some measure be seen from the relations after each chapter. Those two doctrines are the two witnesses here treated of. By “an earthquake” is signified a change of state (n. 331), here their destruction, because in it “a tenth part of the city fell”; by “a tenth part” is signified all there, for “ten” signifies much and all (n. 101); in like manner, “the tenth part,” or “a tenth,” as “the fourth part,” or “a fourth,” signifies the same as “four” (n. 322); and “the third part” or “a third” the same as “three” (n. 400). By “falling” is signified to sink down into hell, which takes place when they are torn away from heaven; for the cities in the world of spirits which are in evils and falsities, after they that dwell therein are visited, informed, and warned, and still remain in their evils and falsities, are shaken with an earthquake, by which a gulf is opened, into which they sink down, and then their inhabitants appear to themselves to be at the bottom, as it were, in a desert, whence they are severally removed to their places in hell.

By “being killed” is signified here, as before, to be killed spiritually, which is to perish as to the soul; by an “earthquake” is signified a change of state among them, and their destruction, as above; by “names of men seven thousand” are signified all who were in the confession of faith alone, and for that reason made no account of the works of charity, and therefore condemned those two holy essentials of the new church; by “names” are signified they who are such, for “a name” signifies the quality of a man (n. 81, 122, 165); and by “seven thousand” are signified all who were such, for the same is signified by “seven thousand” as by “seven,” just as by “twelve thousand” is signified the same as by “twelve” (n. 348). That “seven” signifies all and all things, and is predicated of the holy things of heaven and the church, and in the opposite sense of the same when profaned may be seen (n. 10, 391). 517. And the rest were terrified, and gave glory to the God of heaven signifies that they who had adjoined some goods of charity to faith, when they saw their destruction, acknowledged the Lord, and were separated. By “the rest” are here meant they who adjoined some goods of charity to faith; by “being terrified” is signified through fear, when they saw the destruction of the others; by “giving glory to the God of heaven” is signified to acknowledge the Lord as the God of heaven and earth; by “giving glory” is signified to acknowledge and worship; and by “the God of heaven and earth” is meant the Lord, because he is the God of heaven and earth (Matt. 28:18). These, because they acknowledged the Lord from fear, were separated, in order that they might be explored as to the origin from which they did good, whether from themselves or from the Lord. All they do good from themselves who do not shun evils as sins, that is, who do not live according to the commandments of the Decalogue; but they do good from the Lord, who so shun and live."

That “woe” signifies lamentation over the perverted state of the church, may be seen above (n. 416); by “the third woe” is signified the last lamentation, when it is complete and there is an end; for “three” and “a third” have that signification (n. 505). “To come quickly” signifies hereafter, and “hereafter” means from chapter 12 to 17, and, lastly, chapter 20, where it treats of the last judgment upon them. 519. Verse 15. And the seventh angel sounded signifies the exploration and manifestation of the state of the church after the consummation, when the coming of the Lord and of his kingdom takes place. By “sounding with a trumpet” is signified to explore and make manifest the state of the church after its consummation, when the coming of the Lord and of his kingdom takes place. The reason is because this is signified by “the seventh angel sounding”; for by the six angels and their trumpets sounding were signified explorations and manifestations of the state of the consummated church, as appears from the foregoing chapter, where its consummation only is treated of; but that now its state after consummation, which is the coming of the Lord and of his kingdom, is treated of, appears from what follows in this verse, and afterwards in this verse: And the seventh angel sounded, and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of the world are become our Lord’s and his Christ’s, and he shall reign for ages of ages (Rev. 11:15). The reason why this manifestation is effected by “the sounding of the seventh angel” is because “seven” signifies the same as a week, and six days of the week are days of labor, and of what belongs to man, and the seventh is holy and the Lord’s. That by consummation is meant the devastation of the church when there is no longer any truth of doctrine and good of life therein, thus when its end has come, may be seen (n. 658, 750); and because then is the coming of the Lord and of his kingdom, therefore both"

[3] The reason why the Lord’s Divine human is meant by “Christ” is because Christ is the messiah, and the messiah is the son of God, who was expected to come into the world. That Christ is the messiah appears from this: We have found the messiah, which is, being interpreted, the Christ (John 1:41). The woman said, I know that the messiah cometh, which is called Christ (John 4:25). For “messiah,” in the Hebrew language, is the anointed, as Christ is in the Greek language. That the messiah is the son of God, appears from the following passages: The high priest asked him, whether he was the Christ (messiah) the son of God (Matt. 26:63; Mark 14:61; Luke 22:67; John 20:31). Thou art the Christ the son of God, which should come into the world (John 11:27). Peter said, We believe and acknowledge that thou art the Christ the son of the living God (John 6:69).

For it is like a malefactor who attributes his punishment to the law, or to the fire that burns, if he thrusts his hand in it, or like ascribing to a drawn sword in the hand of one defending himself, if he is thrust through, when he has run against its point.

The reason is because they are called “the living” who have spiritual life. Spiritual life is with those only who approach the Lord and at the same time shun evils as sins.

The reason these are meant by “the dead” is because spiritual death is meant; therefore also by “the slain” they are signified who are destroyed by that death (n. 321, 325), and in other places.

The reason is because affection is of the love, and love is the life of man, therefore the life of everyone after death is such as his ruling love had been in the world; and the ruling love of truth and good is with those who have loved the truths of the Word, and have lived according to them. Nothing else but the delight of good and the pleasantness of truth is meant by “reward” in the following passages: Behold the Lord Jehovah will come in strength; behold, his reward is with him (Isa. 40:10; 62:11).

The reason why “to fear” here signifies to love is because everyone who loves also fears to do evil to him whom he loves. Genuine love is not given without that fear. Therefore he who loves the Lord fears to do evils, because evils are contrary to him, being contrary to his Divine laws in the Word, which are from him and thus are himself; yea, they are contrary to his Divine essence, which is that he wills to save all, for he is the savior, and cannot save man unless man lives according to his laws and commandments. And, what is more, he who loves evils also loves to do evil to the Lord, yea to crucify him. This lies inmostly hid in all evil, even among those who confess him with their lips in the world. That it is so is unknown to men, but it is well known to the angels. [2] That “to fear God” signifies to love the things which are of God, by doing them, and by not willing to do those which are against him, appears from these passages: What doth Jehovah God require of thee, but to fear Jehovah thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him (Deut. 10:12, 20).

I will give them one heart and one way to fear me, and I will put my fear in their heart, that they depart not from me (Jer. 32:39–40). The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom (Ps. 111:10). Besides other places; as in Isa. 8:13; 25:3; 29:13; 50:10; Jer. 33:9; Ps. 22:23; 33:8, 18; 34:7, 9; 55:19; 115:11, 13; 147:11; Rev. 14:7; Luke 1:50. But the fear of God with the evil is not love, but the fear of hell. 528. And to destroy them that destroy the earth signifies the casting of those into hell who have destroyed the church. The reason why by “destroying them that destroy the earth” is signified the casting of those into hell who have destroyed the church is because by “the earth” the church is signified (n. 285), and because it follows after these things, “And the time of the dead is come that they should be judged,” by which is signified the last judgment upon those who have no spiritual life (n. 525); thus here, by “the time is come of destroying them that destroy the earth” is signified the casting down into hell of those who have destroyed the church. The like is said of Lucifer, by whom Babylon is meant, in Isaiah: Because thou hast destroyed thy land and hast slain thy people (Isa. 14:20). 529. Verse 19.

By “the temple of God” is signified the Lord’s Divine human, likewise heaven, where angels are, and also the church on earth; that these three are signified by “the temple of God,” and that they cannot be separated, may be seen (n. 191); but here, by “the temple of God” is signified the Lord in his Divine human in heaven where the angels are, because it is called “the temple of God in heaven.” By “the ark in the temple” is meant the Decalogue, for in the ark there were only the two tables on which the Decalogue was written. By the temple being “open” is signified that these two, the Divine human and the Decalogue, which are the two essentials of the new church, are now seen, and were seen after the evil were cast into hell (n. 528). The reason why it is said “the ark of his covenant was in his temple” is because a covenant signifies conjunction, as will be seen below. [2] But something shall first be said of the Decalogue. What nation is there in the whole world which does not know that it is evil to kill, to commit adultery, to steal, to testify falsely? If mankind did not know these things, and if laws were not made to guard against these crimes, they must perish; for a society, republic, and kingdom would fall without such laws. Who can suppose that the Israelitish nation could have been so much more stupid than all others, as not to know that these things were evils? Therefore anyone may wonder why these laws, universally known throughout the whole world, should have been promulgated by Jehovah himself from Mount Sinai with so great a miracle, and were written with his own finger. But hear: they were promulgated with so great a miracle by Jehovah himself, and were written by his finger, to make known to them that those laws were not only civil and moral laws, but also spiritual laws, and that to act contrary to them, was not only to commit evil against a fellow citizen and against society, but that it was also to sin against God. Wherefore these laws, by being promulgated from Mount Sinai by Jehovah, were made laws of religion. For it is evident that whatsoever Jehovah God commands, he commands that it may be"

[3] These laws, because they were the first fruits of the church about to be established by the Lord among the Israelitish nation, and because they were in a short summary the complex of all things of religion, whereby a conjunction of the Lord with man and of man with the Lord was given, therefore they were so holy, that nothing could be more holy. That they were most holy may appear from this: Jehovah himself, that is the Lord, descended in fire, and the mountain then smoked and quaked, and there were thunders, and lightnings, and a thick cloud, and the voice of a trumpet (Exod. 19:16, 18; Deut. 5:22–26). The people before the descent of Jehovah prepared and sanctified themselves three days (Exod. 19:10–11, 15). The mountain was hedged about lest anyone come near to the lowest part, lest he die (Exod. 19:12–13, 20–23; 24:1–2). This law was written upon two tables of stone, and that it was written with the finger of God (Exod. 31:18; 32:15–16; Deut. 9:10). The face of Moses shone, when he brought those tables a second time down from the mount (Exod. 34:29–35). Those tables were deposited in the ark (Exod. 25:16; 40:20; Deut. 10:5; 1 Kings 8:9). The place in the tabernacle, where the ark was, was called the holy of holies (Exod. 26:33; and in other places). The ark, from the law in it, was called Jehovah there (Num. 10:35–36; 2 Sam. 6:2; Ps. 132:8). Jehovah spoke with Moses over the ark (Exod. 25:22; Num. 7:89)."

By carrying the ark around Jericho, the walls fell down (Josh. 6:1–20). Dagon, the god of the Philistines, fell down to the earth before the ark, and afterwards lay upon the threshold of the temple with his head broken off (1 Sam. 5:3–4). The Ekronites and the Bethshemites were smitten on account of the ark to the number of several thousands (1 Sam. 5; 6). The ark was introduced by David into Zion with sacrifices and rejoicing (2 Sam. 6:1–19). Uzzah, because he then touched it, died (2 Sam. 6:6–7). The ark in the temple of Jerusalem was the inmos t part (1 Kings 6:19 seq.; 8:3–9).

[4] By that law called “a covenant” conjunction is signified; the reason is because covenants were entered into for the sake of love, of friendship, of consociation, and thus of conjunction. Therefore it is said of the Lord, that: He shall be for a covenant to the people (Isa. 42:6; 49:8). And he is called: The angel of the covenant (Mal. 3:1)."

These things took place in the parts below, where the evil still abode, before the last judgment was executed upon them; for it is said in the preceding verse (18), “And the time is come of judging the dead, and of destroying them which destroy the earth.” Such things exist in the world of spirits, from the presence and influx of heaven which is above them. 531. To the above I will add this relation. I was once seized suddenly with a disease almost deadly. My whole head was weighed down. A pestilential smoke ascended from that Jerusalem which is called “Sodom and Egypt.” I was half dead with the severe pain. I expected the end. Thus I lay in my bed three days and a half. My spirit became such, and from it my body. And then I heard voices about me, saying, “Lo, he who preached repentance for the remission of sins, and the man Christ alone, lies dead in the streets of our city.” And they asked some of the clergy whether he was worthy of burial. They said, “No; let him lie to be looked at.” And they passed to and fro, and mocked. All this befell me, of a truth, when I was explaining this chapter of Revelation. Then were heard harsh speeches of scoffers, especially these, “How can repentance be performed without faith? How can the man Christ be adored as God? Since we are saved of free grace without any merit of our own, what need we then but the faith alone, that God the Father"

Are not these things according to Scripture, and also according to reason?” These things the crowd standing by applauded. [2] I heard these things, nor could I reply, because I lay almost dead. But after three days and a half my spirit recovered, and, being in the spirit, I left the street and went into the city, and said again, “Do the work of repentance, and believe in Christ, and your sins will be remitted, and ye will be saved; but otherwise ye will perish. Did not the Lord himself preach repentance for the remission of sins, and that they should believe in him? Did not he command the disciples to preach the same?

[3] When they were thus submerged, and they seemed inundated, I desired to know their lot in the deep. And it was said to me from heaven, “Thou shalt see and hear.” And then the waters, in which they seemed to be inundated, disappeared before my eyes; for waters in the spiritual world are correspondences, and hence appear around those who are in falsities.

Why then has all this befallen us?” [4] But immediately a voice from one side said to them, “Do you know any sin in which you are? Have you ever examined yourselves?

Depart ye, therefore, everyone to his own place. You see the openings into those caverns, enter, and there work shall be given each of you to do, and afterwards food in proportion to your work; if not, still hunger will compel you to enter.” [5] After this there came a voice from heaven to some on earth, who were without that great city, and who are described also (verse 13), crying aloud, “Take heed to yourselves, take heed how you associate with such persons; can you not understand that evils, which are called sins and iniquities, render man unclean and impure?

This is actual repentance. [6] “Who cannot understand that he who does not search out and see his sins, remains in them? For all evil is delightful from birth; for it is delightful to revenge, to commit whoredom, to defraud, to blaspheme, and especially to rule over others from self- love; is it not the delight that causes them not to be seen, and if perchance it is said they are sins, do you not from that delight excuse them? Yea, you persuade yourselves by falsities and confirm that they are not sins, and thus continue in them, and practice them afterwards more than before, even till you no longer know what sin is, or whether there be sin. It is otherwise with everyone who actually repents. His evils which he knows and acknowledges, he calls sins, and on that account begins to shun and turn away from them, and to feel their delight as undelightful. And in proportion as this is the case, he sees and loves goods, and at length feels delight in them, which is the delight of heaven. In a word, so far as anyone rejects the devil, so far he is adopted by the Lord, and by him is taught, led, withheld from evils, and is held in goods. This and no other is the way from hell to heaven.” [7] It is wonderful, that the Reformed have a certain deep-rooted opposition and aversion to actual repentance, which is so great, that they cannot force themselves to examine themselves, neither can they see their sins, and confess them before God. It is as if a horror invades them when they think of it. I have inquired of many in the spiritual world concerning this, and they all said that it was beyond their power. When they heard that the Papists do it, that is, that they examine themselves and confess their sins openly before a monk, they have greatly wondered, more especially as the Reformed cannot do the same in private before God, although it is alike enjoined them before they approach the holy supper.

And a great sign was seen in heaven signifies revelation from the Lord concerning his new church in the heavens and on earth, and concerning the difficult reception and resistance to its doctrine. By “a sign from heaven” is here meant a revelation concerning things to come; and by “a great sign seen in heaven” is meant a revelation concerning the new church, for “the woman clothed with the sun,” which is the subject treated of in this chapter signifies that church. “The male” which she brought forth signifies its doctrine; her being pained to bring forth signifies its difficult reception; “the dragon desiring to devour the male” and afterward “he persecuted the woman” signifies the resistance it meets with. These things are meant by “a great sign was seen in heaven.” “A sign” is mentioned in the Word of things to come, and then it is revelation; it is also spoken of truth, and then it is testification; and it is also spoken of the quality of any state or thing, and then it is manifestation. “A sign” is spoken of things to come, and then it is revelation, in the following passages: They shall tell you what shall happen, that we may know their end, or make you hear things to come; show signs of the future (Isa. 41:22–23). The disciples said unto Jesus, What shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the consummation of the age? (Matt. 24:3; Mark 13:4; Luke 21:7). There shall be signs from heaven, and signs in the sun, the moon, and the stars (Luke 21:11, 25). And then shall appear the sign of the son of man (Matt. 24:30). It was said unto king Hezekiah, This shall be a sign unto thee that Jehovah will do this thing, the shadow on the degrees of Ahaz shall be brought back. Afterwards Hezekiah said, What is the sign that I shall go up into the house of Jehovah? (Isa. 38:7–8, 22; and in other places). That “a sign” is said of truth, and then it is testification, and also it is said of the quality of any state, and then it is manifestation, is evident from other passages in the Word."

A woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet signifies the Lord’s new church in the heavens, which is the new heaven, and the Lord’s new church about to be upon earth, which is the new Jerusalem. That the Lord’s new church is signified by this “woman,” is evident from the particulars in this chapter understood in the spiritual sense; that by “a woman,” in other parts of the Word also, the church is signified, may be seen (n. 434); and the church is signified, because the church is called the Bride and Wife of the Lord. The reason why she was seen “clothed with the sun,” is because the church is in love to the Lord, for it acknowledges him and does his commandments, and this is to love him (John 14:21–24). That “the sun” signifies love (see n. 53). The reason why “the moon” was seen under the woman’s feet is because the church on earth, which is not yet conjoined with the church in the heavens, is meant. By “the moon” is signified intelligence in the natural man, and faith (n. 423); and by being seen “under the feet,” is signified that it is about to be upon earth; otherwise by “feet” is signified the church itself when it is conjoined. [2] It is to be known, that there is a church in the heavens as well as on earth, for there also is the Word; there are temples also, and preachings in them, and there are ministerial and priestly offices. For all angels there were men, and their departure out of the world was only a continuation of their life; therefore they are also perfected in love and wisdom, everyone according to the degree of the affection of truth and good which he took with him out of the world. The church among them is here meant by “the woman clothed with the sun,” who had upon her head a crown of twelve stars”; but because the church in the heavens cannot subsist, except there be also a church on earth, which is in concordant love and wisdom, and as this was about to be, therefore “the moon was seen under the feet of the woman,” which here specifically signifies faith, by which, such as it is at this day, there is no conjunction. [3] The reason why the church cannot subsist in the heavens unless there is a church on earth in conjunction with it, is because heaven where angels are, and the church where men are, act as one, like the internal and the external with man; and the internal with"

From these things, it may be seen how absolutely necessary it is that there should be a church somewhere in the world, where the Word is, and where by it the Lord is known. 534. And upon her head a crown of twelve stars signifies its wisdom and intelligence from knowledges of Divine good and Divine truth from the Word. By “the crown upon the head” is signified wisdom and intelligence (n. 189, 235, 252); by “stars” are signified the knowledges of Divine good and Divine truth from the Word (n. 51, 420); and by “twelve” are signified all things of the church, which have relation to its good and truth (n. 348); consequently, by “a crown of twelve stars on the woman’s head,” is signified the wisdom and intelligence of the new church from the knowledges of Divine good and Divine truth from the Word. 535. Verse 2. And being with child, she cried, travailing, and pained to bring forth signifies the nascent doctrine of the new church, and its difficult reception on account of the resistance by those who are meant by “the dragon.” “To be with child” signifies the nascent doctrine, because by “the offspring which was in the womb” (whose birth is treated of in verse 5), is signified the doctrine of the new church; for nothing else is signified by “being with child,” “in travail,” and “bringing forth,” in the spiritual sense of the Word, than to conceive and bring forth those things which are of spiritual life, concerning which presently. By “she cried, travailing, and pained to bring forth,” is signified the difficult reception of that doctrine, because of resistance by those who are meant by “the dragon.” This is plain from what follows in this chapter, as “that the dragon stood before the woman about to bring forth, that he might devour her offspring,” and afterwards he pursued her into the wilderness."

Sing, O barren, thou that didst not bear, shout, thou that didst not travail, for more are the sons of the desolate than the sons of the married (Isa. 54:1). They have ceased until the barren hath borne seven, and she that hath many children lacketh (1 Sam. 2:5). By “the barren” are signified the gentiles, who had no genuine truths, because they had not the Word; by “the married” and “she that hath many children” are signified the Jews who had the Word. She that hath borne seven languisheth, she hath breathed out her soul (Jer. 15:9). Speaking also of the Jews: We have conceived, we have travailed, we have as it were brought forth wind, we have not wrought any deliverance in the earth (Isa. 26:18).

Pangs and sorrows take hold, they travail like one bringing forth (Isa. 13:8). The iniquity of Ephraim is bound up, the pains of one in travail shall come upon him; he is a son not wise, for he stayeth not the time in the womb of sons (Hos. 13:12–13). Ephraim, thy glory shall fly away like a bird, from the birth, and from the belly, and from conception; give them, O Jehovah, a miscarrying womb, and dry breasts; even when they have begotten, I will slay the desires of their belly (Hos. 9:11, 14, 16). In these passages also is described the difficulty of receiving the truths of doctrine from the Word, by many things relating to “pain in bringing forth,” and in like manner in many other places. Moreover, Jehovah, that is, the Lord, is called “the former from the womb” (Isa. 44:2, 24; 49:1, 5); and by “former from the womb” is meant the reformer. 536. Verse 3.

It is said, they who make God three, and the Lord two, by whom are meant those who think of three persons as three Gods, and separate the Lord’s human from his Divine. And who thinks otherwise, or can think otherwise, whilst, according to a formula of faith, he prays, “That God the Father for the sake of the son would send the Holy Spirit?” Does he not pray to God the Father as to one God, and for the sake of the son as another, and concerning the Holy Spirit as a third? From which it is evident that although in thought he makes three persons one God, still he divides them, that is, divides his idea into three gods when he so prays. The same formula of faith also makes the Lord two, since he thinks only of the Lord’s human, and not at the same time of his Divine; “for the sake of the son” means for the sake of his human which suffered the cross. From what has now been said, it may appear who they are that are meant by the dragon, who would devour the woman’s offspring, and afterwards “pursued the woman into the wilderness on account of her offspring.” [3] The reason why the dragon is called “great,” is because all the churches of the Reformed distinguish God into three persons, and make faith alone saving, except some here and there, who do not think alike concerning the trinity, and concerning faith. They who divide God into three persons, and adhere to these words of the Athanasian doctrine, “There is one person of the Father, another of the son, and another of the Holy Spirit”; and also to these, “The Father is God, the son is God, and the Holy Spirit is God”; these, I say, cannot make one God out of three; they may indeed say that they are one God, but they cannot think so.

Now because these two essentials of the doctrine in the churches of Reformed are falsities, and as falsities devastate the church, since they take away its truths and goods, therefore they were represented by “a dragon.” The reason is, because by “a dragon,” in the Word, is signified the devastation of the church, as may appear from the following passages: I will make Jerusalem heaps, a habitation of dragons, and I will reduce the cities of Judah to a waste (Jer. 9:11). Behold, a great tumult out of the land of the north, to reduce the cities of Judah to a waste, a habitation of dragons (Jer. 10:22).

[5] That by “the dragon” are here meant those who are in faith alone, and reject the works of the law as not saving, has sometimes been testified to me in the spiritual world by living experience. I have seen several thousands of them assembled together, when from a distance they have appeared like a dragon with a long tail, that seemed set with spines like thorns, which signified falsities. Once, also, there was seen a dragon still larger, which raising his back and lifting up his tail towards heaven, endeavored to draw down the stars from thence.

The reason why it is said that the dragon has much power is because the salvation of man by faith alone, without the works of the law, which faith is meant by “the dragon,” captivates minds, and then confirmations persuade. It captivates, because man, on hearing that the damnation of the law is taken away, and the Lord’s merit is imputed to him through faith alone in this, he can indulge in the pleasures of his mind and body, without any fear of hell; hence comes the power which is signified by “the ten horns of the dragon.” That such has been his power, evidently appears from the reception of that faith everywhere throughout the Reformed Christian world. 540. And upon his heads, seven diadems signifies all the truths of the Word falsified and profaned. By “diadems” or precious stones, are signified the truths of the Word; specifically, the truths of the sense of the letter of the Word, but here, those truths falsified and profaned, from their being seen “upon the seven heads of the dragon,” by which is signified insanity from truths falsified and profaned (n. 538).

The reasons I know, but I shall here mention only one of them. They assert, that whatsoever proceeds from man’s will and judgment is not good; and that therefore the goods of charity, or good works, being done by man, contribute nothing to salvation, but faith only; when, nevertheless, that alone, by virtue of which man is man, and by which he is conjoined with the Lord, is that he can do good and believe truth, as from himself, that is, as from his own will according to his own judgment. If this faculty were taken away from him, all power of conjunction of man with the Lord, and of the Lord with man, would also be taken away at the same time; for this is the reciprocal of love, which the Lord gives to everyone who is born a man, and which he also preserves in"

That by “a daughter” is signified the affection of the truth of the church, thus the church as to that affection, appears from so many passages in the Word, that to adduce them would fill many pages; nothing else is meant by “the daughter of Zion,” “the daughter of Jerusalem,” “the daughter of Judah,” “the daughter of Israel.” Some passages respecting “the daughter of Zion” may be seen adduced (n. 612). Who cannot see that not any “daughter of Zion,” “Jerusalem,” “Judah,” and “Israel,” so often mentioned in the Word, can be meant? 544. Who was to tend all nations with a rod of iron signifies which, by truths from the sense of the letter of the Word, and, at the same time, by rational things from natural light, will convince all who are in dead worship from faith separated from charity, that are willing to be convinced. This is concerning the doctrine of the new church, because it is spoken of “the son a male,” by whom that doctrine is signified (n. 543); “to tend” signifies to teach and instruct (n. 383); here to convince those who are willing to be convinced; by “nations” are signified they who are in evils of life (n. 483); here, they who are in dead worship from faith separated from charity, because these are here treated of; and these are in evils of life, for when charity is separated, there is not any good of life, and where good is not, there evil is. That “to rule with a rod of iron” signifies by the truths of the literal sense of the Word, and at the same time by rational things from natural light, may be seen above (n. 148). 545. And her offspring was caught up unto God and his throne signifies the protection of the doctrine by the Lord, because it is for the new church, and its being guarded by the angels of heaven. By these words is signified the protection of the doctrine by the Lord, because it is said that “the dragon stood before the woman about to bring forth, to devour her offspring after it was brought forth”; and by “offspring” and “a son, a male” is signified the doctrine for the new church (n. 542, 543). Being guarded by the angels is also signified, because it is said, that “it was caught up unto God and to"

And the woman fled into the wilderness signifies the church which is the new Jerusalem, at first among a few. By “the woman” is signified the new church (n. 533); and by “a wilderness” is signified where there are no longer any truths. That its being at first among a few is signified, because it follows, “where she hath a place prepared by God, that they should nourish her there a thousand two hundred and sixty days,” by which is signified its state at that time, that in the meanwhile it may be provided among many; even until it increases to its appointed state (n. 547). By “a wilderness,” in the Word, is signified: (1) The church devastated, or in which all the truths of the Word are falsified, such as it was among the Jews at the time of the Lord’s advent. (2) The church in which there are no truths, because they have not the Word, such as it was among the upright gentiles in the Lord’s time.

By “place” is signified state (n. 947); and by “to nourish,” provision for its increase, for thus is the church nourished; hence by “having a place prepared by God that they may nourish her,” is signified the state of the church that in the meantime it may be provided among many; by “a thousand two hundred and sixty days” is signified to the end and the beginning (n. 491), that is, to the end of the former church and the beginning of the new, the same as by a time, and times, and half a time, verse 14 (n. 562); thus also to its appointed state, that is, until it exists as has been provided. It is of the Lord’s Divine providence, that the church should at first be among a few, and that it should successively increase among many, because the falsities of the former church must first be removed; for before this, truths cannot be received, since truths, which are received and implanted before falsities are removed, do not remain, and they are also dissipated by the dragonists; the like happened with the Christian church, which increased successively from a few to many. Another reason is that the new heaven is first to be formed, which will act as one with the church that will be on earth; therefore we read that: He saw a new heaven, and the holy Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from God (Rev. 21:1–2)."

Verse 7. And there was war in heaven, Michael and his angels fought with the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels signifies the falsities of the former church fighting against the truths of the new church. By “war” is signified spiritual war, which is of falsity against truth, and truth against falsity (n. 500), for no other war can take place in heaven, where this is said to have existed; neither can it take place in heaven, when once formed of angels; but it was done in “the former heaven which passed away” (spoken of in Rev. 21:1). Concerning which heaven, see the explanation there given; for that heaven passed away by the last judgment on the dragon and his angels, which is also signified by “the dragon was cast down, and his place was found no more in heaven,” as appears from what follows. What the falsities are, which are meant by “the dragon,” and which are about to fight against the truths of the new church, may be seen above (n. 537). By “Michael” is not meant any archangel; neither by “Gabriel and Raphael,” but ministries in heaven are meant; the ministry signified by “Michael” is performed by those who confirm from the Word, that the Lord is the God of heaven and earth, and that God the Father and he are one, as the soul and body are one; also that men ought to live according to the commandments of the Decalogue, and that then men have charity and faith. “Michael” is also mentioned in Daniel (10:13, 21; 12:1); and by him a similar ministry is meant, as appears from chapters 9–11, and from the last verses of chapter 12. But by “Gabriel” is meant the ministry of those who teach from the Word, that Jehovah came into the world, and that the human he there assumed is the son of God, and Divine; for which reason, the angel who announced the same to Mary is called “Gabriel” (Luke 1:19, 26–35). They also, who are engaged in those ministries, are named “Michaels” and “Gabriels” in heaven. By “an angel,” in the highest sense, is meant the Lord; and in a relative sense, the heaven of angels, as also an angelic society as may be seen above (n. 5, 65,"

Verse 8. And they prevailed not, and their place was not found any more in heaven signifies that they were convicted of being in falsities and evils, but still they remained in them, and that therefore they were torn away from conjunction with heaven and cast down. That this may be understood, something must first be said concerning the state of those who come into the other life after death. All there are first instructed by angels, and led from one society to another, and explored whether they will receive the truths of heaven, and live according to them. But still, all those who have confirmed themselves in falsities in the world do not receive them; therefore they are sent into societies where they are who are in similar falsities, which societies have no conjunction with heaven, but with hell. Therefore after some time in the world of spirits they sink down into hell, and are sent away to their places, everyone according to his evil and falsity thence; this is what is meant by their being convicted of being in falsities and evils, and still they remain in them, and that therefore they are torn away from conjunction with heaven, and cast down. What their lot is there may be seen above (n. 153, 531). 550. Verse 9. And that great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the devil, and satan signifies that they who are meant by “the dragon” turned from the Lord to themselves, and from heaven to the world, and thence became sensual from the corporeal, who could not but be in the evils of their lusts and thence in falsities, and by separation from the Lord and heaven became devils and satans. Who are meant by “the dragon” may be seen (n. 537); these, inasmuch as they make God three, and the Lord two, and because they place the commandments of the Decalogue among works by which there is not any salvation, are called “the old serpent, the devil, and satan”; and by “a serpent” is signified a man sensual from the corporeal (n. 424), who turns from the Lord to himself, and from heaven to the world; and by “the devil” are"

Such also was the serpent which seduced Eve and Adam, as appears from his description and the curse pronounced upon him (Gen. 3:1–5, 14–15). “The dragon” is here called “the devil and satan,” but he is so called, because all in hell are devils and satans; and thence hell in the aggregate is so called. 551.

By “to seduce” is signified to pervert, and by “the world” is signified the church; the same as by “earth” (n. 285).

But it is to be known, that when “the world” and “the earth” are mentioned together, “the world” signifies the church as to good, and “the earth” signifies the church as to truth. 552. He was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him signifies that he was cast down into the world of spirits, which is intermediate between heaven and hell, from whence there is immediate conjunction with the men of the earth [tellus]. The reason why by “the earth,” upon which the dragon is said to have been cast out, is meant the world of spirits, is that that world is immediately beneath the heavens, and when anyone is cast down from heaven, he does not fall immediately into hell, but upon the earth of the world immediately beneath it, for that world is intermediate between heaven and hell, or below the heavens and above the hells. Many things concerning that world may be seen in Heaven and Hell, published at London in the year 1758 (n. 421–535) All who are in that world communicate immediately with men upon earth; consequently, the dragon and his angels communicate with those who are in falsities, and thence in evils, through the received heresy of faith alone; on which account, it is said below, “Therefore rejoice, ye heavens; woe to the inhabitants of the earth and the sea, for the devil is come down unto you, having great anger, knowing that he hath but a short time (verse 12 of this chapter). Also that “he pursued the woman into the wilderness, and went to make war with the rest of her seed” (verses 13–17). It is to be known that every man, as to his affections and thoughts thence, is in society with those who are in the world of spirits, and mediately through them, with those who are either in heaven or in hell. The life of every man depends on that conjunction. 553. Verse 10. And I heard a great voice in heaven, saying, Now is come the salvation, and the power, and the kingdom of our God and the authority of his Christ signifies the joy of the angels of heaven, because the Lord alone now reigns in heaven and in the church, and because they are saved who believe in him.

That by “God” is meant the Divine itself from whom are all things, and which is called Jehovah the Father; and by “Christ” is meant his Divine human which is called the son of God, may be seen above (n. 520); and because the Divine from whom are all things, and the Lord’s Divine human are one, like the soul and the body, it follows that the Lord alone reigns. This is meant by “the gospel of the kingdom,” and by “the kingdom of God.” (Matt. 3:2; 4:17, 23; 7:21; 9:35; 11:11; 12:28; Mark 1:14–15; 9:1; 15:43; Luke 4:43; 8:1; 9:60; 10:8–11; 11:17–18, 20; 16:16; 21:31; 22:18; 23:50–51.) [2] That the Lord has all power in heaven and on earth, appears manifestly in Matt. 28:18; John 3:35; 17:2, 10. That they are saved who are in the Lord and the Lord in them, and that it is the Divine human in which they are, John 14; 15; 17; and that no others are saved, but they that believe in him, appears from these passages: As many as received him, to them he gave power to become the sons of God, to them that believe in his name (John. 1:12). That everyone that believeth in the son should not perish, but have eternal life (John 3:15). God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believeth in him may have eternal life (John 3:15). He that believeth in the son is not judged; but he that believeth not is judged already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten son of God (John 3:36). He that believeth in the son hath eternal life, but he that believeth not the son, shall not see life, but the anger of God abideth on him (John 3:36)."

Verily I say unto you, he that believeth in me hath eternal life (John 6:33, 35, 47). Unless ye believe that I am, ye shall die in your sins (John 8:24). Jesus said, I am the resurrection and the life, he that believeth in me, though he were dead, shall live; whosoever liveth and believeth in me, shall not die to eternity (John 11:25–26; besides other places as in John 6:38–40; 7:37–38; 8:12; 12:36–46.) To believe in the Lord is to approach him immediately, and to have confidence that he saves; and since no one can have this confidence except he who lives well, therefore this also is meant by “believing in him” (see above, n. 67). 554. For the accuser of our brethren is cast down, that accused them before our God day and night signifies that by the last judgment they are removed who opposed the doctrine of the new Jerusalem. By the dragon “being cast down” is signified that they were removed who are meant by “the dragon”; that they were removed by being cast down from heaven into the world of spirits, and then into hell, which is their last judgment, was said before. By “brethren” are meant they who are the doctrine of the new Jerusalem, and in a life according to it; by “accusing” is signified to oppose the doctrine, to maintain that it is false, and to cry out against it; and because they do this continually, as it were before God, the dragon is called “the accuser of our brethren, accusing them before God day and night.” This also the devil does when he tempts, for he brings forth various things out of man, which he calls falsities, and condemns. 555.

Those at the present day, that are in faith alone, believe that, by “the blood of the Lamb,” is here meant the Lord’s passion of the cross, and this because they make the Lord’s passion of the cross the principal one of their dogmas, saying that thereby he transferred to himself the condemnation of the law, made satisfaction to the Father, and reconciled the human race to him; besides many other things. That this, however, is not the case, but that the Lord came into the world to subdue the hells and glorify his human, and that the passion of the cross was the last combat, by which he fully conquered the hells and fully glorified his human, may be seen in Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Lord (n. 12–14). Hence it may be seen, that by “the blood of the Lamb” is not here meant the passion of the cross according to the modern dogma. That by “the blood of the Lamb” is meant the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord, which is the Divine truth of the Word, may appear from this consideration, that the Lord is the Word; and because he is the Word, the Divine truth therein is his blood, and the Divine good therein, his body. This may be made manifest in this manner: Is not every man his own good and his own truth? And, since good is of the will, and truth of the understanding, every man is his own will and his own understanding. What else constitutes a man? Is not man, as to his essence, these two? But the Lord is good itself and truth itself, that is Divine good and Divine truth, which two are also the Word. 556. And they loved not their soul unto death signifies who loved not themselves more than the Lord. By “loving their soul” is signified to love themselves and the world, for by the soul is signified man’s own life, which everyone has by birth, which is to love himself and the world above all things; therefore by “not loving his soul” is signified not to love himself and the world more than the Lord and the things which are of the Lord; “unto death” signifies to be willing to die rather; consequently it is to love the"

The same is signified by these words of the Lord: Whosoever will find his soul, shall lose it, and whosoever shall lose his soul for the sake of Jesus, shall find it (Matt. 10:39; Luke 17:33). He that loveth his soul shall lose it; but he that hateth his soul in this world shall keep it unto life eternal (John 12:25). Jesus said, If any one will come after me, let him deny himself; for whosoever will save his soul, shall lose it; but whosoever will lose his soul, for my sake, shall find it. What is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, but cause the loss of his soul? or what shall a man give as a sufficient price of redemption for his soul? (Matt. 16:24, 26; Mark 8:35–37; Luke 9:24–25). By “loving the Lord” is meant to love to do his commandments (John 14:20–24). The reason is, because he himself is his own commandments, for they are from him, consequently he is in them, thus in the man in whose life they are inscribed; and they are inscribed in man by willing and doing them. 557.

The reason why every man is in conjunction with those who are in the world of spirits, is because man, as to the affections of his mind and the thoughts thence proceeding, is a spirit; therefore as to such affections and thoughts, he is continually in conjunction with spirits who are in a similar affection, and thence in similar thoughts. There is such a conjunction, that if this bond was broken for a single moment, man would fall down dead. The church has hitherto known nothing of this; nor that man, after death, is his own affection and thought thence, therefore his own charity and faith thence, and that no one can be faith separated from charity. 559.

By “the face of the serpent” is signified the subtle arts of seducers; by “the face,” subtle artfulness; and by “the serpent,” seducers. That by “the serpent” are signified seducers, is plain from the following passage in this chapter: The great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, which seduceth the whole globe of earth (Rev. 12:9). He laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, and cast him into the abyss, that he should seduce the nations no more (Rev. 20:2–3). The like is here meant as by the serpent which seduced Eve and Adam, of whom it is said: And the serpent was more subtle than any wild beast of the field; and the woman said to Jehovah, The serpent seduced me (Gen. 3:1, 13). [2] By “face,” in the Word, is signified that which is interior in man, because the face is the type of his mind formed to correspondence; therefore, by “the face of the serpent” is signified anger, hatred, and subtlety. By “a time, and times, and half a time,” is signified the same here, as by “a thousand two hundred and sixty days,” verse 6, where it is said: And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God, that they should nourish her a thousand two hundred and sixty days (Rev. 12:6); which may be seen explained above (n. 547). The same is also signified by “three days and a half” (Rev. 11:9, 10); also by “the three years and six months” of famine (Luke 4:25); and in Daniel, by A stated time of stated times and a half when he shall have finished to scatter the hand of the people of holiness (Dan. 12:7)."

The reasonings of those who are meant by “the dragon,” are all from fallacies and appearances, which, if confirmed, appear outwardly like truths, but within they conceal falsities in abundance. This I can declare, that those in the church, who hereafter confirm themselves in faith alone, cannot recede from it, except by serious repentance, because they conjoin themselves with the dragonists, who now are in the world of spirits, and are tumultuous, and there out of hatred against the new church, they infest all whom they meet; and as they are conjoined with men on the earth, as observed above, they will not suffer those who have once been caught by their reasonings to recede from them; for they hold them bound in chains, as it were, and then shut their eyes so that they can no longer see any truth in light. 564.

How can any man be led by the Lord, and conjoined with heaven, who shuts up his understanding in such things as relate to salvation and eternal life? Is it not the understanding which will be enlightened and taught?

Again, who can acknowledge any truth and retain it, unless he sees it?

Therefore by “the dragon being angry with the woman,” is signified that he burned with hatred and breathed revenge against the church; by “the dragon’s anger” is signified hatred (n. 558); by “making war” is signified to assault and impugn by reasonings from falsities (n. 500); by “the rest of her seed which keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ,” are meant novitiates who receive the doctrine concerning the Lord and concerning the Decalogue; what “the testimony of Jesus Christ” is, may be seen above (n. 6, 490). [2] The reason why by “the dragon” are here meant those who believe themselves wise from confirmations in favor of the mystic union of the Lord’s Divine and human is because these are in the pride of their own wisdom, and know how to reason; and from pride proceeds hatred, and from hatred proceed anger and revenge against those who do not believe likewise. By the mystic union, which is also called the hypostatic union, are meant their fictions concerning the influx and operation of the Divine in the Lord’s human as upon another; not knowing that God and man, or the Divine and the human in the Lord, are not two but one person, united like soul and body, according to the doctrine received throughout the whole Christian world, which has its name from Athanasius; but to adduce their fictitious things respecting this mystic union would be an idle thing, because they are absurd.

They all agreed in this, that no one can, except from God, because: No man can receive anything except it be given him from heaven (John 3:27). For which reason the dispute was, whether it is possible to anyone unless he goes immediately to the Lord. They said on the one hand, that the Lord is to be approached directly, because he is the Word; and on the other, that doctrinal truth may also be seen when God the Father is immediately approached.

They were those who in the world prayed to the Father, and confirmed themselves in justification by faith alone; and they said that they saw the tenet that man is justified by faith alone without the works of the law, in clear light, and also from the Word. They were asked, “By what faith?” They answered, “In God the Father.” But after they were examined, it was said to them from heaven, that they did not know even one doctrinal truth from the Word. But they replied that still they saw this in the light. It was then said to them that they saw it in fatuous light. They asked, “What is fatuous light?” They were informed that fatuous light is the light of the confirmation of falsity; and that this light corresponds to the light in which owls and bats are, to which darkness is light, and light is darkness. This was confirmed by the fact, that when they looked upwards to heaven, where light itself is, they saw darkness; but when they looked downwards to the abyss whence they were, they saw light."

And then the keeper said, “You see that the things which you have written upon the paper are truths.

[6] The angelic spirits who were present wondered that they had not before known anything of that place, and of the table there. And a voice then came to them from the southern quarter, saying, “Come hither, and you will see something still more wonderful.” And they came, and entered into a chamber, the walls of which shone as if from gold; and they saw there also a table, upon which lay the Word, set around with precious stones in heavenly forms. And the angel keeper said, “When the Word is opened, a light beams forth thence of ineffable brightness; and at the same time there appears from the precious stones a rainbow above and around the Word. When any angel from the third heaven comes thither, and looks at the open Word, there appears above and around the Word a rainbow of various colors on a red ground.

When an angel from the lowest heaven comes and looks, there appears a rainbow on a white ground. When any good spirit comes and looks, there appears a variegation of light, as of marble.” That it was so, was also shown them visibly. The angel keeper further said, “If anyone approaches, who has falsified the Word, the splendor is then first dissipated; and if he approaches, and fixes his eyes on the Word, there is an appearance of blood around; and he is then admonished to depart, because there is danger.” [7] But a certain one, who in the world had been a prominent author on the doctrine of faith alone, boldly approached, and said, “When I was in the world, I did not falsify the Word; I also exalted charity together with faith; and I taught that man in the state of faith, in which he does charity and its works, is renewed, regenerated, and sanctified; and also that faith is then not solitary,"

But then suddenly fire with smoke issued from the Word, and an explosion took place with a great crash, by which he was thrown to a corner of the chamber, and lay there as dead for half an hour. This the angelic spirits wondered at; but it was said to them, that that prelate had exalted the goods of charity as proceeding from faith more than others; but that still he meant no other than political works, which are also called moral and civil, and which are to be done for the sake of the world and of prosperity therein; but not any works which are to be done for the sake of God and salvation: and also that he included the unseen works of the Holy Spirit, of which the man knows nothing; which are implanted in the act of faith during its state. [8] The angelic spirits then conversed among themselves concerning the falsification of the Word: and they agreed upon this, that to falsify the Word is to take truths from it, and apply them to confirm falsities; which is to drag them forth from the Word outside of it, and slay them. As for example: he who takes therefrom this truth, that the neighbor is to be loved, and that good is to be done to him from love for the sake of God and eternal life; if anyone then confirms this, that it is to be done, but not for the sake of salvation, because all good from man is not good, he drags that truth from the Word outside of the Word, and destroys it; since the Lord in his Word enjoins it upon every man who wishes to be saved, to do good to his neighbor as of himself, and yet to believe that it is of the Lord."

THE SPIRITUAL SENSE The contents of the whole chapter In this chapter the dragon continues to be treated of, and the doctrine and faith which is meant by it is described; what its quality is with the laity, and afterwards what its quality is with the clergy: by “the beast coming up out of the sea,” that doctrine and faith with the laity is described (verses 1–10); and by “the beast out of the earth,” the same with the clergy (verses 11–17): lastly, concerning the falsification of the truth of the Word by the latter (verse 18). The contents of each verse Verse 1. “And I saw a beast coming up out of the sea” signifies the laity in the churches of the Reformed, who are principled in the doctrine and faith of the dragon concerning God and salvation: “Having seven heads” signifies insanity arising from mere falsities: “And ten horns” signifies much power: “And upon his horns ten"

Verse 2. “And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard” signifies a heresy destructive of the church because derived from truths of the Word falsified: “And his feet like a bear’s” signifies full of fallacies from the literal sense of the Word read but not understood: “And his mouth as the mouth of a lion” signifies reasonings from falsities as if from truths: “And the dragon gave him his power, and his throne, and great authority” signifies that this heresy prevails and reigns in consequence of its reception by the laity. Verse 3. “And I saw one of his heads as if wounded to death” signifies that the doctrine of faith alone does not accord with the Word, in which works are so often enjoined: “And the stroke of his death was healed” signifies the remedy applied on this account: “And the whole earth wondered after the beast” signifies that then this doctrine and faith was gladly received. Verse 4. “And they adored the dragon which gave authority to the beast” signifies the acknowledgment that it is such as is laid down by the leaders and teachers, who have established its authority on the reception they have procured for it among the community at large: “And they adored the beast” signifies the acknowledgment on the part of the community that it is holy truth: “Saying, who is like unto the beast? Who is able to fight with him?” signifies the excellence of that doctrine, because it cannot be contradicted by anyone. Verse 5. “And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies” signifies that it teaches what is evil and false: “And there was given unto him authority to work forty-two months” signifies the liberty of teaching and doing the evils and falsities of that doctrine, even to the end of that church and the beginning of the new. Verse 6. “And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name” signifies their sayings, which are scandals against the essential divinity and Divine human of the Lord, and at the same time against everything relating to the church derived from the Word, whereby the Lord is worshiped: “And his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven” signifies scandals against the Lord’s celestial kingdom and against heaven.

Verse 8. “And all that dwell on the earth shall adore him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb” signifies that all acknowledged that heretical doctrine as holy in the church, except those who believed in the Lord: “Slain from the foundation of the world” signifies the Lord’s Divine human not acknowledged from the first establishment of the church. Verse 9. “If anyone hath an ear let him hear” signifies that they should attend to this who desire to attain wisdom. Verse 10. “If anyone shall lead into captivity he shall go into captivity” signifies that he who by means of this heretical doctrine misleads others from believing well and living well, will himself be drawn into hell by his own evils and falsities: “If anyone shall kill with the sword he must be killed with the sword” signifies that he who by means of falsities destroys the soul of another, is himself destroyed by falsities, and perishes: “Here is the patience and the faith of the saints” signifies that the man of the Lord’s new church, by temptations from such things, is explored as to the quality of his life and faith. Verse 11. “And I saw another beast coming up out of the earth” signifies the clergy who are principled in the doctrine and faith of the dragon concerning God and salvation: “And he had two horns like a lamb, and he spoke as a dragon” signifies that what they say, teach, and write is from the Word, as though it were the Lord’s Divine truth, and yet it is truth falsified. Verse 12. “And he exerciseth all the authority of the first beast before him” signifies that they confirmed these tenets, which thence derive their authority: “And he causeth the earth and them that dwell therein to adore the first beast whose stroke of his death was healed” signifies that from their being received by the community at large, it is established and confirmed that they ought to be acknowledged and held sacred in the church. Verse 13. “And he doeth great signs” signifies testifications that the things they teach are true, although they are false: “So that he also maketh fire to come down from heaven unto the earth before men” signifies attestations that their falsities are truths.

Verse 17. “And that no one could buy or sell, if he hath not the mark or the name of the beast, or the number of his name” signifies that it is not lawful for anyone to teach from the Word, unless he acknowledges it, and swears to the belief and love thereof, or to something which amounts to the same. Verse 18. “Here is wisdom” signifies that it is the part of a wise man, from what had been said and explained in this chapter, to see and understand the nature of the doctrine and faith of the clergy respecting God and salvation: “He that hath intelligence let him count the number of the beast” signifies that he who is in illumination from the Lord, may know the nature and quality of the proofs they produce from the Word in confirmation of that doctrine and faith: “For it is the number of a man” signifies the quality of the Word and thence of the church: “And his number is six hundred sixty-six” signifies this quality, that all the truth of the Word is falsified by them."

And I saw a beast coming up out of the sea signifies the laity in the churches of the Reformed who are in the doctrine and faith of the dragon concerning God and salvation. What the faith of the dragon is and its quality, may be seen (n. 537). The same faith continues to be treated of in this chapter; and by this “beast” which “was seen to come up out of the sea,” is meant that faith with the laity; but by “the beast out of the earth” (mentioned at verse 11), is meant that faith with the clergy. That the dragon continues to be treated of here is evident from these things in this chapter; that “the dragon gave the beast coming up out of the sea his power, and throne, and great authority” (verse 2); and that “they adored the dragon which gave authority to the beast” (verse 4); and of “the beast from the earth, that he spoke like the dragon” (verse 11); and that he exerciseth all the authority of the former beast before the dragon (verse 12). The reason why the laity are meant by “the beast out of the sea,” and the clergy by “the beast out of the earth,” is because by “the sea” is signified the external of the church, and by “the earth” its internal (n. 398, and in other places); and the laity are in the externals of the doctrine of the church, and the clergy are in its internals; on this account “the beast out of the earth” is also called, in what follows, “the false prophet.” That they who are in the churches of the Reformed are meant, is because the Reformed are treated of as far as chapter 16 inclusive, and the Roman Catholics in chapters 17 and 18, and afterwards the last judgment, and finally the new church. [2] They were seen as “beasts,” because a dragon is a beast, and because “a beast” in the Word signifies man as to his affections; harmless and useful beasts signify man as to good affections, and noxious and useless beasts signify man as to his evil affections; on which account the men of the church in general are called “sheep,” and a congregation of them, “a flock,” and their teacher is called “a pastor.” Hence also it is that the Word as to its power, affection, understanding, and wisdom, is described above, by “four animals,”"

The reason is because the affections of a man, in the spiritual world, appear at a distance as beasts, as has been stated before; and beasts, considered in themselves, are nothing but forms of natural affections, but men are not only forms of natural, but of spiritual affections at the same time. [3] That men, as to their affections, are meant by “beasts,” may appear from these passages: Thou didst cause a bountiful rain to drop, thou didst confirm thy inheritance, when it was laboring; the beast of thy assembly shall dwell in it (Ps. 68:9–10). Every wild beast of the forest is mine, the beasts upon a thousand mountains. I know every bird of the mountains, the beasts of the fields are mine (Ps. 50:10). Assyria is a cedar in Lebanon, he has become of high stature, in his branches all the birds of the heavens made their nests, and under his branches all the beasts of the field have brought forth, and under his shadow have dwelt all great nations (Ezek. 31:3–6, 10, 13; Dan. 4:7–13). In that day I will make a covenant for them with the beast of the field, and with the bird of the heavens, and I will betroth thee unto me forever (Hos. 2:18–19). Rejoice and be glad, be not afraid, ye beasts of my fields, for the habitations of the wilderness have become herbaceous (Joel 2:21–22). In that day there shall be a great tumult, Judah shall fight against Jerusalem, and there shall be a plague of the horse, of the mule, of the camel, and of every beast; then shall everyone that is left go up to Jerusalem (Zech. 14:13–16).

Jehovah gathered the outcasts of Israel; all ye beasts of my fields, come ye (Isa. 56:8–9). Jehovah will destroy Assyria, every wild beast of the nation shall rest in the midst of her; both the spoonbill and the bittern in her pomegranates (Zeph. 2:13–14). The sheep are scattered without a shepherd, and are food for every wild beast of the field (Ezek. 34:5, 8). I will cast thee forth upon the faces of the field, and will make every bird of the heavens to dwell upon thee, and I will satisfy every wild beast of the earth from thee (Ezek. 32:4; also 5:17; 29:5; 33:27; 39:4; Jer. 15:3; 16:4; 19:7; 27:5–6). The enemy reproacheth Jehovah; O give not to the beast the soul of the turtledove (Ps. 74:18–19). I saw in vision four beasts coming up out of the sea, the first was like a lion, and had eagle’s wings, the second was like a bear, the third like a leopard, and the fourth was terrible (Dan. 7:2–7). The spirit impelling Jesus made him go into the wilderness, and he was with the beasts, and the angels ministered unto him (Mark. 1:12–13). [4] He was not with beasts, but with devils, who are here meant by “beasts”; besides other passages where “beasts” and “wild beasts” are named (as in Isa. 35:9; 43:20; Jer. 12:4, 8–10; Ezek. 8:10; 34:23, 25, 28; 38:18–20; Hos. 4:2, 3; 13:8; Joel 1:16, 18, 20; Hab. 2:17; Dan. 2:37, 38; Ps. 8:6–8; 80:13; 104:10, 11, 14, 20, 25; 148:7, 10; Exod. 23:28–30; Lev. 26:6; Deut. 7:22; 32:24).

By all the beasts that were sacrificed were signified good affections; and likewise by the beasts which were eaten; but the contrary by the beasts which were not to be eaten (Lev. 20:25–26). 568. Having seven heads signifies insanity from mere falsities, in like manner as by “the seven heads of the dragon” (n. 538). 569. And ten horns signifies much power, in like manner as the horns of the dragon, which also were ten (n. 539). 570. And upon his horns ten diadems signifies the power of falsifying many truths of the Word. By “a horn” is signified power (n. 539); by “ten” is signified much (n. 101); and by “diadems” are signified the truths of the Word falsified (n. 540); therefore by “upon his horns ten diadems,” is signified to have it in his power to falsify many truths of the Word. Of the dragon it is said that he had “seven diadems” on his heads, but of this beast that he had “ten diadems” on his horns; the reason is because here it signifies the power of falsifying many truths of the Word, but there the falsification of all; for the laity are able, but do not; for they who are in falsities and in the belief of them, are opposed to truths, consequently, when they see truths in the Word, they falsify them. 571.

As to the first, that it is blasphemy to deny the Lord’s Divine in his human, the reason is that he who denies it is opposed to the faith received throughout the whole Christian world, named from Athanasius, where it is expressly said that in Jesus Christ, God and man, that is, the Divine and the human, are not two but one, and that they are one person, united like soul and body.

[2] As to the second, that it is blasphemy not to draw the doctrine of the church from the Word, but to hatch it out of one’s own intelligence, the reason is because the church is from the Word, and its quality is according to the understanding of the Word, as may be seen in Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Sacred Scripture (n. 76–79). And the doctrine that faith alone, that is, faith without the works of the law, justifies and saves, is not from the Word, but from a single expression of Paul falsely understood (Rom. 3:28, see n. 417); and every falsity of doctrine is derived from no other source than from one’s own intelligence. For what is more universally taught in the Word, than to shun evil and do good? And what is more evident than that God and the neighbor ought to be loved? And who does not see, that no one can love the neighbor, unless he lives according to the works of the law, and he who does not love his neighbor does not love God? For in the love of the neighbor the Lord conjoins himself with man, and man conjoins himself with the Lord, that is, the Lord and man are together in that love. And what is it to love the neighbor but not to do him evil, according to the commandments of the Decalogue (Rom. 13:8–11)? And as far as man does not will to do evil to the neighbor, so far he is willing to do him good; hence it is evident that it is blasphemy to exclude the works of this law from salvation, as they do, who make faith alone saving, which is faith separated from good works. By “blasphemy” (Matt. 12:31–32; Rev. 17:3; Isa. 37:6–7, 23–24) is meant to deny the Lord’s Divine, as the Socinians do, and to deny the Word; for they who thus deny the Lord’s Divine cannot enter heaven, for the Lord’s Divine is the all in all in heaven, and he who denies the Word denies all things of religion. 572. Verse 2. And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard signifies a heresy destructive of the church, because it is from the truths of the Word falsified.

That “a leopard” signifies the truths of the Word falsified, is owing to its black and white spots, for by the black spots are signified falsities, and by the white among them is signified truth. Therefore because it is a fierce and savage beast, it signifies the truths of the Word falsified and thus destroyed. Similar is the signification of a “leopard” in the following passages: Can the Ethiopian change his skin, and the leopard his spots? Then may ye also do good that have been taught to do evil (Jer. 13:23). The lion out of the forest hath smitten the magnates, and a wolf of the fields shall devastate them, a leopard shall watch over their cities, everyone that goeth out shall be torn in pieces, because their backslidings are strong (Jer. 5:6). “The leopard watching against their cities,” means watching against the truths of doctrine. “A city” means doctrine (n. 194). As they have forgotten me, therefore I have become unto them as a lion, as a leopard by the way will I observe them (Hos. 13:6–7). “A way” also signifies truth (n. 176). The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard with the kid (Isa. 11:6). Here the Lord’s kingdom which is to come is treated of; “a kid” signifies the genuine truths of the church, and “a leopard” the same falsified.

That these are signified by “bears” was clear to me from the bears seen in the spiritual world, and from some there who were clothed in bear skins, who had all read the Word, but had not seen any doctrinal truth therein; also who had confirmed the appearances of truth therein, whence they had fallacies. In that world there appear bears that are hurtful, and bears that are harmless, and some that are white; but they are distinguished by their heads; those which are harmless have heads like calves or sheep. “Bears” have such a signification in the following passages: He hath overturned my highways, as a bear lying in wait for me, as a lion in secret places, he hath turned aside my ways, he hath made me desolate (Lam. 3:9–11). I will meet them as a bear that is bereaved, and there will I devour them like an immense lion, the wild beast of the field shall tear them (Hos. 13:7–8).

The lion and the bear, which David took by the beard and smote (1 Sam. 17:34–37) has a like signification and likewise 2 Sam. 17:8.

This took place because Elisha represented the Lord as to the Word (n. 298); and because “baldness” signifies the Word without the sense of the letter, thus not anything (n. 47); and the number forty- two, blasphemy (n. 583); and “bears” signify the sense of the letter of the Word, read indeed, but not understood. 574. And his mouth as the mouth of a lion signifies reasonings from falsities as if from truths. By “mouth” is signified doctrine, preaching and discourse (n. 452), here reasoning from falsities of doctrine, because by “the head,” in which is the mouth, is signified insanity from mere falsities (n. 568); by “a lion” is signified Divine truth in power (n. 241, 471), but here falsity in power appearing like truth by reasonings (n. 573); hence by “his mouth being as the mouth of a lion,” are signified reasonings from falsities as if from truths. That “a leopard,” “a bear,” and “a lion” signify such things, may appear from similar beasts that were seen by Daniel, of which it is thus written: Four great beasts came up out of the sea; the first was like a lion, and had eagle’s wings; I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and erected upon its feet like a man, and a man’s heart was given to it. The second beast was like a bear, and it raised up itself on one side; and it had three ribs in its mouth, between its teeth; and it was said, Arise, devour much flesh. The third beast was like a leopard, which had upon its back four wings as of birds; the beast had also four heads, and dominion was given to it. The fourth beast was terrible and dreadful, and exceedingly strong, and it had great iron teeth; it devoured and broke in pieces, and trampled the residue with its feet (Dan. 7:3–7).

By “one of the heads” is signified the chief and fundamental article of the whole doctrine of the church of the Reformed. For the beast had seven heads, by which is signified insanity from mere falsities (n. 568); thus also all falsities in the aggregate: for by “seven” in the Word is signified all (n. 10, 391). And as all the falsities of their doctrine concerning salvation depend on this one, that man is justified and saved by faith alone without the works of the law, it is this which is signified by “one of the heads of the beast.” By its being “as it were wounded unto death,” is signified that it does not agree with the Word, where works are so often commanded. For everything of the doctrine of the church, which does not agree with the Word, is not sound, but is sick with a deadly disease; for the doctrine of the church must be from the Word, and from no other source. 577. And the stroke of his death was healed signifies the healing of that head of the doctrine by this reasoning, that no one can do a good work of himself, and fulfil the law, and that there is on that account provided another means of salvation instead, which is faith"

That this is the healing for “the wounded head,” and is also applied, is known, when by the wounded head is meant that which precedes (n. 576); and therefore there is no need to explain it further. 578. And the whole earth wondered after the beast signifies that then that faith was received with joy, and became the doctrine of the whole church, because they thus would not be servants under the law, but free under faith. And “it wondered” signifies astonishment that the stroke of death was healed, and thence reception with joy. By “the whole earth” is signified the whole church of the Reformed, for the earth is the church (n. 285); therefore by “the whole earth wondered after the beast” is signified that this faith was received with joy, and became the doctrine of the whole church. It is received with joy because they thus are not bondmen under the law, but free under faith; not knowing that the very reverse is true, namely, that they who believe themselves to be free under faith, or from that faith, or through that faith, are slaves under sin, that is, under the devil, for sin and the devil are one and the same; for thus they believe that the law does not condemn, and therefore that to sin without the condemnation of the law is freedom, provided they have faith; when nevertheless this is slavery itself; but man when he shuns sin, that is, the devil, from being a slave becomes free. [2] Here I will add this relation: I spoke in the world of spirits with some doctors of the church, about what they meant by “works of the law,” and what by “the law” under whose yoke, servitude, and condemnation they say they are not. They said they meant the works of the law of the Decalogue. And I then said, “What are the things decreed in the Decalogue? Are they not these: ‘thou shalt not kill,’ ‘thou shalt not commit whoredom,’ ‘thou shalt not steal,’ ‘thou shalt not bear false witness’? Are these the works of the law, which you separate from faith, saying, that ‘faith alone, without the works of the law, justifies and saves,’ and are these what Christ made satisfaction for?” And they replied, “They are.” And then there was heard a voice from heaven, saying, “Who can be so"

It is said that “all the earth wondered after the beast”; that “after” the beast means to follow and obey it, appears from these passages: David hath kept my commandments and hath walked after me with the whole heart (1 Kings 14:8). The sons of Jesse went after Saul to the war (1 Sam. 17:13). Thou shalt not go after many to do evil. Thou shalt not answer in a cause after many, to pervert (Exod. 23:2). Go not after other gods, whom ye know not (Jer. 7:9). They went after other gods to serve them (Jer. 11:10; Deut. 8:19). The men that went after Baalpeor Jehovah will destroy (Deut. 4:3). 579. Verse 4. And they adored the dragon, which gave authority to the beast signifies the acknowledgment of the doctrine of justification by faith, without the works of the law, by the leaders and teachers, who have caused it to prevail through reception by the common people. By “adoring” is signified to acknowledge it as holy in the church; by “the dragon” is signified the doctrine of justification and salvation by faith alone, without the works of the law (n. 537); by this “beast” is signified the common people because it is the laity (n. 567); by “giving power” is signified to cause it to prevail by its reception among the laity (n. 575). 580.

But that these truths, and many others, are falsified, may be seen above (n. 566). By “the beast” is here signified the same as by “the dragon,” on account of the reception and acknowledgment; therefore it is said that they “adored the dragon,” and “adored the beast.” 581. Saying, Who is like unto the beast? Who is able to fight with him? signifies the excellence of that doctrine above all others, because it cannot be contradicted by anyone. “Who is like unto the beast” signifies the opinion of the excellence of that church above all others on account of its doctrine; by “the beast” is signified the common people, thus the church, and abstractly its doctrine. “Who is able to fight with him” signifies, who can contradict that man is not able to do any spiritual good from himself, besides other things, as above (n. 566); and as this cannot be contradicted, “are we not therefore saved by faith without the works of the law?” But that this conclusion is absurd, yea, insanity itself, may be seen by everyone who knows anything and is wise from the Word. “Who is able to fight with him,” also signifies that this doctrine has been so ingeniously and subtly confirmed, and so fortified by its leaders, and the teachers after them, that it cannot be impugned. 582. Verse 5. And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies signifies that it teaches evils and falsities. By “a mouth speaking” is signified doctrine, preaching, and discourse (n. 452); by “speaking great things and blasphemies,” is signified to teach evils and falsities; for “great” is predicated of good, and in the opposite sense of evil (n. 656, 663, 896, 898), and by “blasphemies” are signified the truths of the Word falsified thus falsities; what is here signified by “blasphemies” in particular, may be seen above (n. 571). The reason why it teaches evils is because it removes the works of the law, thus the things which ought to be done, from salvation, and he who does this is in spiritual evils, which are sins."

And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, and his name signifies their sayings, which are scandals, against the Divine itself and the Divine human of the Lord, and at the same time against everything of the church from the Word, by which the Lord is worshiped. “He opened his mouth in blasphemy” signifies the things uttered, which are false; by “a mouth” is signified doctrine, preaching, and discourse (n. 452), thus by “opening the mouth,” is signified to utter them; and “blasphemies” signify falsifications of the Word, and other things, as above (n. 571, 582), and in the present case, scandals, because it follows, against God and his name; by “God” is signified the Lord’s Divine, as also in many other parts of Revelation; and by “his name” is signified everything by which the Lord is worshiped, likewise the Word, because worship is according to it (n. 81). That by “the name” of Jehovah, or of God, is signified the Lord’s Divine human, and at the same time the Word, likewise everything by which he is worshiped, may further appear from the following passages: Jesus said, Father, glorify thy name; then came a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again (John 12:28).

By “a tabernacle” nearly the same is signified as by “a temple,” namely, in the supreme sense, the Lord’s Divine human, and, in a relative sense, heaven and the church (n. 191, 529). But by “a tabernacle,” in this latter sense, is signified the celestial church, which is in the good of love from the Lord to the Lord; and by “a temple,” the spiritual church, which is in the truths of wisdom from the Lord; by “them that dwell in heaven” is signified heaven. “The tabernacle” signifies the celestial church, because the most ancient church, which was celestial, because in love to the Lord, held holy worship in tabernacles; and the ancient church, which was a spiritual church, held holy worship in temples. Tabernacles were of wood, and temples of stone, and “wood” signifies good, and “stone” truth. [2] That by “a tabernacle” is signified the Lord’s Divine human as to the Divine Love, likewise heaven and the church, which are in love to the Lord, may appear from the following passages: Jehovah, who shall abide in thy tabernacle; who shall dwell in the mountain of thy holiness?

And whatsoever is given to be seen from heaven, the same is representative of heaven, and thence of the church.

The like is signified by these words in Daniel: The fourth beast that came up out of the sea, which had a mouth speaking great things, made war with the saints and prevailed (Dan. 7:20–21). Also by these: The he-goat ran at the ram, and cast him to the earth, and stamped upon him; and lifted himself up against the prince of the host, and the habitation of his sanctuary was cast down; and he cast down the truth to the earth (Dan. 8:5–7, 11–12).

That this “king” is the “he-goat,” is said there (verse 21). The like is also signified by: The beast that came up out of the abyss, and made war with the two witnesses, and overcame and killed them (Rev. 11:7). (See n. 500.) They overcame, because the laity do not discern their subtleties, which they call mysteries, for they conceal them under appearances and fallacies; therefore they said, “Who is like unto the beast? Who is able to fight with him?” (verse 4), (n. 579, 581). [2] That by “saints” are meant those who are in truths from the Lord through the Word, may appear from the passages adduced above (n. 173), and also from the following: Jesus said, Father, sanctify them in thy truth, thy Word is truth. I sanctify myself, that they may be sanctified in the truth; I in them, and thou in me (John 17:17, 19, 23). Jehovah came from Sinai, he came from the myriads of holiness, from his right hand went the fire of the law to them, all his saints are in thy hand; he shall receive of thy words (Deut. 33:2–3). From this it is plain, that they are called “saints” who are in Divine truths from the Lord through the Word: also, that they who live according to the commandments, that is, according to the truths of the Word, were the “saints of Jehovah” (Lev. 19:2; Deut. 26:18–19). And if they would keep the covenant, they would be a “holy nation” (Exod. 19:5–6). The Decalogue is the covenant which they were to do (n. 529).

By virtue of truths from the Lord the angels are called “holy” (Matt. 25:31; Luke 9:26); and in like manner the prophets (Luke 1:70; Rev. 18:20; 22:6); and the apostles (Rev. 18:20). It is for this reason that the temple is called “the temple of holiness” (Ps. 5:7; 65:4) and Zion, “the mountain of holiness” (Isa. 65:11; Jer. 31:23; Ezek. 20:40; Ps. 2:6; 3:4; 15:1). And Jerusalem is called “the holy city” (Isa. 48:2; 64:10; Rev. 21:2, 10; Matt 27:53). And the church is called “the people of saints” (Isa. 62:12; 63:18; Ps. 149:1); and also the “kingdom of saints” (Dan. 7:18, 22, 27). The reason why they were called holy, is because “angels,” in an abstract sense signify Divine truths from the Lord; “prophets,” truths of doctrine; “apostles,” truths of the church; “the temple,” heaven and the church as to Divine truth; and, in like manner, “Zion,” “Jerusalem,” “the people” and “the kingdom of God.” That no one is holy from himself, not even the angels, may be seen in Job 15:14, 15, but from the Lord, because “the Lord alone is holy” (Rev. 15:4).

Slain from the foundation of the world signifies the Lord’s Divine human not acknowledged from the establishment of the church. By “the Lamb slain” is signified that the Lord’s Divine human is not acknowledged; this may be seen above (n. 59, 269), where these words are explained: I am the first and the last, and am he that liveth, and was dead, and behold I am alive for ages of ages (Rev. 1:17–18). And the following: And I saw, and behold, in the midst of the throne, a Lamb standing as it were slain; and they sang a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God (Rev. 5:6, 9). “From the foundation of the world” signifies from the establishment of the church, both the Jewish and the Christian. That the Jews did not acknowledge the Lord’s Divine human is known. That the Roman Catholics do not is also known. And that the Reformed do not may be seen above (n. 294).

That “the world” also means the people of the church (John 12:19; 18:20).

Here it is said, “If anyone hath an ear let him hear,” in order that they may attend to what goes before, and that otherwise they are not wise. 591. Verse 10. If anyone shall lead into captivity he shall go into captivity signifies that he who by means of this heretical doctrine leads others away from believing well and living well, will himself be led away into hell by his own falsities and evils.

By “going into captivity” is signified to be led away into hell by his own falsities and evils. By “captivity” is here meant spiritual captivity, which is to be seduced, and thus led away from truths and goods, and led into falsities and evils. That by “captivity” in the Word is meant this spiritual captivity may appear from the following passages: Hear all ye people, and see my sorrow; my virgins and my young men have gone into captivity (Lam. 1:18). God forsook his habitation and tent where he dwelt among men, and gave his strength into captivity (Ps. 78:60–61)."

By “a sword,” “a sabre,” and “a long sword,” is signified truths, and in the opposite sense, falsity, both combating (n. 52, 836); therefore by “killing” and “being killed” is signified to destroy and be destroyed, or to destroy and perish, which is effected by falsities. 593. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints signifies that the man of the Lord’s new church, by temptations from them, is explored as to the quality of his life and faith. By “patience” is here signified patience in temptations, and then exploration of man’s quality as to life according to the Lord’s commandments, and as to faith in the Lord; therefore it is said, “here is the patience and the faith”; by “saints” are signified they who are of the Lord’s new church, specifically they who are in Divine truths therein (n. 586). Patience is predicated of temptations, whereby man is explored as to what he really is; also elsewhere in Revelation (as in chapters 1:9; 2:3, 19; 3:10). That it is as to life according to the Lord’s commandments, and as to faith in him, is evident from these words: They have no rest day nor night who adore the beast and his image, here is the patience of the saints; here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus (Rev. 14:11–12). 594. Verse 11. And I saw another beast coming up out of the earth signifies the clergy in the churches of the Reformed who are in the doctrine and faith of the dragon concerning God and salvation. What the faith of the dragon is and its quality, may be seen above (n. 537). That it is the laity that are meant by “the beast which came up out of the sea,” and the clergy by “the beast which came up out of the earth,” because by “the sea” is signified the external of the church, and by “the earth” its internal (n. 398, 567); and the"

That the clergy are now described, appears from all the particulars which follow, when understood in the spiritual sense; and manifestly from this that this beast is also called “the false prophet” (Rev. 16:13; 19:20; 20:10); and especially from the following passage: And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that did signs before him, by which he seduced them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that adored his image (Rev. 19:20). That this beast did signs before the other, by which he seduced them, is said in this chapter in these words: And he doeth great signs, and he seduceth them that dwell on the earth, on account of the signs which it was given him to do before the beast, saying to them to make an image to the beast, and adore it (Rev. 13:13–15). 595. And he had two horns like a lamb, and he spoke like the dragon signifies that they speak, teach, and write from the Word, as if it were from the Lord’s Divine truth, and yet it is truth falsified. By “horns” is signified power (n. 270, 443), here the power of speaking, teaching, and writing, thus of reasoning and arguing. That the horns were seen “like a lamb” signifies that they propagate these their notions as though they were the Lord’s Divine truths, because they are from the Word; for by “a lamb” is meant the Lord as to the Divine human, and also as to the Word, which is the Divine truth from the Divine good; hence it is that upon this beast, which is also the false prophet (n. 594), there appeared two horns like a lamb; but that they were Divine truths falsified, is signified by “he spoke like a dragon.” That all the truths of the Word are falsified by those who are in the faith of the dragon concerning God and salvation, may be seen above (n. 566). [2] That these two things are signified by “this beast had two horns like a lamb and he spoke like a dragon” appears evidently from these words of the Lord in Matthew:"

By “Christ” is signified the same as here by “lamb”; namely the Lord as to the Divine truth of the Word; therefore their saying, “Lo, here is Christ” signifies that they would say that this is the Divine truth of the Word; but that it is that falsified is signified by these words: “If anyone shall say unto you, here is Christ, or there, believe it not, for there shall arise false Christs and false prophets.” That these are they concerning whom the Lord prophesied, is plain from this, that it is said they would give great signs and wonders, and would if possible lead into error the elect; the same as is said of the beast, which is the false prophet (in verses 13–14 of this chapter). The things which the Lord foretold in that chapter of Matthew relate to the last time or state of the church, which is there meant by “the consummation of the age.” 596. Verse 12. And he exerciseth all the authority of the first beast before him signifies that they have confirmed the dogmas which are signified by “the dragon,” and are received by the laity, and that through it they prevail. That this is signified, may be seen from the explanation above concerning the authority given by the dragon to the beast coming up out of the sea (n. 575, 579); and because this beast, which is the false prophet, exercised that authority before the dragon, nothing else is signified than that they caused them to prevail by confirmations. 597. And he causeth the earth and them that dwell therein to adore the first beast the stroke of whose death was healed signifies that thus by confirmations they have established this, that it is to be acknowledged as a holy thing of the church, that because no one can do a good work from himself and fulfil the law, the only means of salvation is faith in the justice and merit of Christ, who suffered for man, and thereby took away the condemnation of the law. It is unnecessary to explain this any further, because it follows from the explanations given above (n. 566, 577–582). By “the earth and them that dwell therein,” are signified the churches of the"

Verse 13. And he doeth great signs signifies testifications that the things they teach are true, although they are false. By “signs” are signified testifications that things are true, because formerly signs were wrought to bear testimony to the truth. But after signs and miracles ceased, their signification still remains, which is a testification of the truth. But here by “signs” are signified testifications from the beast or false prophet, that his falsities were truths, by reason that after they are confirmed they do not appear otherwise. That the testifications that it is the truth are signified by signs, may appear from the following passages: In the consummation of the age there shall arise false Christs and false prophets, and shall give great signs and portents, and, if it were possible, they would lead into error the very elect (Matt. 24:24; Mark 13:22). There shall also be dreadful signs from heaven; and there shall be signs in the sun, the moon, and the stars, the sea and the waves roaring (Luke 21:11, 25).

Learn not the way of the nations, and be not dismayed by the signs of the heavens (Jer. 10:2). They are the spirits of demons working signs to gather them to the battle of that great day (Rev. 16:14). The beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that did signs before him, and seduced (Rev. 19:20).

[3] Hence it may clearly be seen that by “the great signs,” which this beast of the dragon works, are not meant signs, but the testifications by them that what they teach are truths; for every heretic who has confirmed himself in falsities, after confirmation strives to prove that his falsities are truths; for then he no longer sees truths, inasmuch as the confirmation of falsity is the denial of truth, and a truth denied loses its light; and so far as falsities shine from the light of confirmation, which is a fatuous light, so far the light of truth becomes darkness, as may be seen above (n. 566). 599. So that he also maketh fire to come down from heaven upon earth before men signifies attestations that their falsities are truths of heaven, and that they who receive them are saved, and that they who do not receive them perish. The reason why this is signified by these words is because the greatest signs were made by fire from heaven; whence it was a common expression among the ancients in confirmation of anything, when the attestation of truth was spoken of, that “they could bring down fire from heaven and testify it”; by which was signified that they could testify even to that extent. That the truth was also attested by “fire from heaven,” appears from the following passages: That the burnt offering which was offered by Aaron was consumed by fire from heaven (Lev. 9:24). In like manner the burnt offering offered by Elijah (1 Kings 18:38). [2] “Fire from heaven,” in the opposite sense, was a sign testifying that they were in evils and thence in falsities and that they would perish; but this fire was a consuming fire; as: The fire from heaven that consumed the two sons of Aaron (Lev. 10:1–6). That which consumed two hundred and fifty men (Num. 26:10). That which consumed the uttermost parts of the camp (Num. 11:1-4)."

The disciples being angry with the impenitent, said to Jesus, Lord, wilt thou that we call fire to come down from heaven and consume them? (Luke 9:54.) These passages are adduced to show that “fire from heaven” signifies a testification, yea, an attestation, that truth is truth, and, in the opposite sense, that falsity is truth, as here. “Fire” also signifies celestial love, and thus zeal for the truth, and in the opposite sense, infernal love, and thence zeal for falsity (n. 468, 494). 600.

[2] Every church appears before the Lord as a man; if it is in truths from the Word, it appears as a beautiful man, but if it is in truths falsified, it appears as a man-monster. The church so appears from its doctrine and from a life according to it; from which it follows, that the doctrine of a church is its image. This may also be seen from this: Every man is his own good and truth, or his own evil and falsity, from this and from no other source man is a man. Consequently it is doctrine and life according to it which makes “the image” of the man of the church, the image being that of a beautiful man, if the doctrine and the life according to it is from the genuine truths of the Word; but it is the image of a man- monster, if from falsified truths of the Word. [3] Man, also, in the spiritual world, appears like some animal; but it is his affection which thus appears at a distance. They who are in truths and goods from the Lord, appear as lambs and doves; but they who are in falsified truths and adulterated goods, appear as owls and bats. They who are in faith separated from charity, appear as dragons and goats; they who are in falsities from evil, as basilisks and crocodiles. And they who are such, and yet have confirmed the doctrinals of the church, appear like fiery flying serpents. From these things it may be seen, that the doctrine of the church and life according to it are meant by “the image of the beast” which they made for “them that dwell upon the earth.” [4] But what became of those who “adored the image of the beast,” may be seen (Rev. 14:9–11; 19:20; 20:4).

Verse 15. And it was granted to him to give breath unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should also speak signifies that it was permitted them to confirm that doctrine by the Word, from which it is as it were vivified when it is taught. By “granted” is signified that it was permitted; for all falsities of doctrine, as well as evils of life, are done from permission, concerning which see Angelic Wisdom concerning Divine Providence (n. 234–284, 296). By “the image of the beast,” that doctrine is signified (n. 601); by “giving breath to the image of the beast” is signified to confirm it from the Word, for there is no spirit and life to any doctrine of the church from any other source. That “the image of the beast might speak” signifies that thus it is as it were vivified when it is taught. That this is meant by “giving breath to the image of the beast, that it might speak,” is because in every particular of the Word there is spirit and life, for the Lord spoke the Word; therefore he himself is in it, and he so spoke the Word as that everything therein should have communication with heaven, and through heaven with himself. There is a spiritual sense there by which communication is effected; wherefore the Lord says: The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit and life (John 6:63). 603. And cause that as many as do not adore the image of the beast should be killed signifies that they pronounce damnation upon those who do not acknowledge their doctrine of faith to be the holy doctrine of the church. “To adore the image of the beast” signifies to acknowledge their doctrine of faith as the holy doctrine of the church, for by “adoring” is signified to acknowledge as a holy thing of the church (n. 579, 580, 588, 597); and by “the image of the beast” is signified that doctrine (n. 601); by “being killed” is signified to be killed spiritually, which is to be condemned (n. 325, and elsewhere); and as “being killed” signifies to be condemned, it also signifies to be declared as heretical and excluded from the"

These condemn all who do not think as they do, and so far as they dare, they fulminate against them. [2] This I can relate, that they who have imbibed these mysteries, and thence were in the pride of erudition in the spiritual world, are so enraged against those who adore the Lord alone, and do not acknowledge faith alone as the only means of salvation, that they burn with wrath, anger and fury when they see them, and also when they feel at a distance the Divine sphere of the Lord and a sphere of charity encompassing them. Since they are such, the dragon is therefore described as a most bitter enemy against them; as that: He stood before the woman about to bring forth that he might devour her offspring after it was born. And the serpent cast out of its mouth water as a river after the woman, that he might cause her to be swallowed up by the rivers. And the dragon was angry against the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed (Rev. 12:4, 15, 17). That out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet, there came forth three unclean spirits like frogs, to gather them to the battle of the great day of God almighty (Rev. 16:13–16; likewise 19:19–20, and 20:8–10).

Ye have sold yourselves for nought, therefore ye shall not be redeemed by silver (Isa. 52:3). With thy wisdom and with thy intelligence thou hast made for thyself wealth; and by the multitude of wisdom and by thy traffic thou hast multiplied for thyself wealth (Ezek. 28:4–5). Since by “Tyre” is signified the church as to the knowledges of good and truth, therefore it is said of Tyre: All the ships of the sea were for trading thy merchandise; Tarshish was thy merchant in silver; Javan, Tubal, and Meshech, they were thy merchants, they gave thy merchandise with the soul of man. Syria was thy merchant in chrysophasus; thy wealth, thy traffic, thy merchandise, they that carry on thy merchandise shall fall into the heart of the seas in the day of thy fall (Ezek. 27:1 to the end). Howl, ye ships of Tarshish, for Tyre is laid waste, whose merchants are princes, and whose traffickers are the honored of the earth (Isa. 23:1–8).

By “the number of the beast” is signified the quality of the confirmations of doctrine and faith from the Word with them (n. 608–609); by “six hundred sixty-six” is signified every truth of good, and as this is said of the Word, it signifies every truth of good in the Word, here the same falsified, because it is “the number of the beast.” The reason of this signification is because “six” signifies the same as “three” multiplied by “two”; and “three” signifies what is full and all, and is predicated of truths (n. 505), and “two” signifies the marriage of truth and good; and as “six” is composed of those two numbers multiplied by each other, it therefore signifies every truth of good in the Word, here the same falsified; that it is also falsified by them may be seen above (n. 566). The number “six hundred sixty-six” is used, because in that number six is tripled, and triplication completes; the multiplying by one hundred, whence comes “six hundred,” and by ten, whence comes “sixty,” changes nothing (see n. 348). [2] That “six” signifies what is full and all, and is used where the truths of good are treated of, may appear from those passages in the Word where that number occurs; but the signification of this"

That the householder went out and brought laborers into his vineyard at the third hour and at the sixth hour (Matt. 20:3, 5). That upon the table in the tabernacle the cakes of bread were arranged in two rows, six in each (Lev. 24:6). That there were set six water pots, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews (John 2:6). That there were six cities of refuge or asylums (Num. 35:6, 7; Deut. 19:1–9). That the measuring reed with which the angel measured all parts of the new temple and the new city, was six cubits (Ezek. 40:5). That the prophets should drink water by measure, the sixth part of a hin (Ezek. 4:11). That they should take for an offering the sixth part of an ephah of a homer of wheat (Ezek. 45:13). Because “six” signifies what is full, the word “to take a sixth part” came into use, by which, in the spiritual sense, is signified what is complete and entire; as that: They should offer the sixth part of an ephah out of a homer of wheat (Ezek. 45:13). And it is said of Gog: I will turn thee back, and leave the sixth part of thee (Ezek. 39:2)."

To these I will add this relation. All who are prepared for heaven, which is effected in the world of spirits, which is in the midst between heaven and hell, after a certain time, desire heaven with a certain longing, and presently their eyes are opened, and they see a way which leads to some society in heaven. They enter this way and ascend, and in the ascent there is a gate, and a keeper there. The keeper opens the gate, and thus they go in. Then an examiner meets them, who tells them from the governor, that they may enter in still further, and inquire whether there are any houses which they can recognize as their own, for there is a new house for every novitiate angel; and if they find any, they give notice of it and remain there. But if they do not find any, they come back and say they have not seen any. And then they are examined by a certain wise one there, to discover whether the light that is in them agrees with the light of that society, and especially whether the heat does; for the light of heaven in its essence is Divine truth, and the heat of heaven in its essence is Divine good, both proceeding from the Lord as the sun there. If any other light and any other heat than the light and heat of that society is in them, they are not received; that is, if any other truth and any other good is in them. Therefore, they depart thence, and go in the ways which are opened among the societies in heaven, and this till they find a society which agrees in every respect with their affections, and here they take up their abode to eternity. For they are here among their like, as among relations and friends whom, because they are in a similar affection, they love from the heart and there they are in the enjoyment of their life, and in a fullness of bosom delight derived from peace of soul; for there is in the heat and light of heaven an ineffable delight, which is communicated. Such is the case with those who become angels.

And then they begin to have a beating at the heart, and a straitness over the breast, the mind is seized with anguish, and they become more and more tormented, and in that state writhe themselves about like a serpent laid before the fire; therefore, they roll themselves away, and cast themselves headlong down a precipice which then appears to them; nor do they rest till they are in hell among their like, where they can respire, and their heart can vibrate freely. Afterwards they hate heaven, and reject truth, and in heart blaspheme the Lord, believing that their tortures and torments in heaven proceeded from him. [3] From these few things it may be seen what their lot is who make no account of truths, which yet make the light in which the angels of heaven dwell, and who make no account of goods, which yet make the heat in which the angels of heaven are. From these things it may appear how much they are in error, who believe that everyone may enjoy heavenly beatitude by mere admission into heaven. For the faith at this day is that heaven is received from mercy alone; and that reception into heaven is like being admitted, in this world, into a house where there is a marriage, and then at the same time into the joy and gladness. But let them know that there is a communication of affections in the spiritual world, man being then a spirit, and the life of a spirit is affection, from which, and according to which, is thought; and that homogeneous affection conjoins and heterogeneous affection disjoins, and that heterogeneity would torment a devil in heaven, and an angel in hell. For which reason they are separated exactly according to the diversities, varieties, and differences of the affections which are of love. [4] It was granted me to see upwards of three hundred of the clergy of the Reformed world, all men of learning, who knew how to confirm the doctrine of faith alone even to justification, and some of them still further. And because there prevailed a belief among them also, that heaven consists only in admission by favor, leave was given them to ascend to a society in heaven, though not"

And when they entered into heaven they were received with civility by the angels, but when they discoursed with them, they were seized with trembling, afterwards with horror, and lastly with the agonies as it were of death, and then they cast themselves down headlong, and in their descent they appeared like dead horses. The reason of their appearing like calves as they ascended was because from correspondence the natural affection of seeing and knowing appears gamboling like a calf; and the reason why they appeared like dead horses as they fell was because from correspondence the understanding of truth from the Word appears like a horse, and the nonunderstanding of truth in the Word, like a dead horse. [5] There were boys below, who saw them falling, to whom in their descent they seemed like dead horses. And then they turned away their faces, and said to their master, who was with them, “What is this portent? We beheld men and now instead of them there are dead horses, the sight of which we could not bear, and we therefore turned away our faces. Master, let us not stay in this place, but let us go away”; and they departed. The master then instructed them in the way what “a dead horse” is, saying, “‘A horse’ signifies the understanding of the Word; all the horses which you saw signified that; for when a man goes meditating from the Word, then his meditation, at a distance, appears as a horse, noble and lively, as he meditates spiritually on the Word, and, on the contrary, poor and dead, as he meditates materially.” [6] The boys then asked, “What is it to meditate on the Word spiritually and materially?” And the master replied, “I will illustrate it by examples. Who, when he reads the Word, does not think of God, his neighbor, and heaven? Everyone who thinks of God only from person, and not from essence, thinks materially; also he who thinks of the neighbor only from form, and not from quality, thinks materially; and he who thinks of heaven only from place, and not from the love and wisdom which heaven is he also thinks materially.” But the boys"

But I will return to what I said at first, that he who thinks materially, when he reads the Word or is meditating from it, appears at a distance like a dead horse; but he who reads it spiritually, like a living horse; and that he thinks materially concerning God and the trinity, who thinks of God only from person, and not from essence. For there are many attributes of the Divine essence, such as omnipotence, omniscience, omnipresence, mercy, grace, eternity, and others; and there are attributes proceeding from the Divine essence, which are creation and preservation, salvation and redemption, enlightenment and instruction. Everyone who thinks of God only from person, makes three gods, saying that one God is the creator and preserver, another the savior and redeemer, and the third the enlightener and instructor. But everyone who thinks of God from essence, makes one God, saying, God created and preserves us, redeems and saves us, enlightens and instructs us. “This is the reason why they who think of the trinity in God from person, and thus materially, cannot, from the ideas of their thought, which are material, do otherwise than out of one God make three; but yet, contrary to their thought, they are held to saying that in each there is a communion of all the attributes, and this solely because they have also thought of God obscurely from essence. Therefore, my pupils, think of God from his essence, and from that of his person, and not from his person, and from this of his essence, for to think of his essence from person, is to think materially of his essence also; but to think of his person from essence, is to think spiritually even of his person. The ancient gentiles, because as they thought materially of God, and also of the attributes of God, not only imagined three gods, but many even to the number of a hundred. Know then that the material does not"

It is similar with the thought of the neighbor from form, and not from his quality, and with the thought of heaven from place, and not from the love and wisdom which heaven is. It is similar with each and everything in the Word. Therefore, he who cherishes a material idea of God, and likewise of the neighbor and of heaven, cannot understand anything there. The Word is to him a dead letter, and he himself, when he reads it or meditates on it, appears at a distance as a dead horse. [8] “They whom you saw falling from heaven, and who appeared in your sight like dead horses, were such as had closed the rational sight in themselves and others by this peculiar dogma, that the understanding is to be kept in subjection to their faith; not considering that the understanding, when closed by religion, is as blind as a mole, and there is mere thick darkness in it, and such thick darkness as rejects from itself all spiritual light, opposes its influx from the Lord and from heaven, and sets up a barrier against it in the sensual corporeal part, far below the rational in matters of faith, that is, places it near the nose, and fixes it in its cartilage, on which account they cannot afterwards so much as scent spiritual things; whence some have become such that when they sensate the odor from spiritual things they fall into a swoon; by odor I mean perception. These are they who make God three. They say indeed from essence that God is one; but yet when they pray from their faith, which is that “God the Father would have mercy for the sake of the Son and send the Holy Spirit,” they evidently make three gods. They cannot do otherwise, for they pray to one to have mercy for the sake of another, and send a third.” And then their master taught them concerning the Lord, that he is the one God, in whom is the divine trinity."
