      "text": "APOCALYPSE EXPLAINED 2036 Editor’s Preface This edition of Apocalypse Explained was translated by John C. Ager and revised by John Whitehead. The text was electronically scanned from the Swedenborg Foundation’s Standard Edition of 1911–1912. This process allowed the books to be completely reset in a more readable typeface. It also allowed for updating certain stylistic elements and for substituting contemporary spellings. Arabic numbers have replaced the Roman numerals, and some of the longer passages have been divided into paragraphs for greater ease of reading. The Ager/Whitehead translation, however, has not been materially altered. Volume 4 of Apocalypse Explained continues Swedenborg’s verse- by-verse exposition, or commentary, of the biblical text of the Apocalypse, commonly known as Revelation or the Revelation of John. This volume covers chapters 11 and 12. As was the custom in his day, Swedenborg referred to the Psalms as the book of David, and to the Pentateuch (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy) as the books of Moses. As with previous printings, the bold numerals in brackets, [2], [3], etc., indicate divisions of Swedenborg’s longer numbered sections that were added for the convenience of the reader by J. F. Potts in his six-volume Swedenborg Concordance (London: Swedenborg Society, 1888–1902). The numbers in parentheses (6), (7), etc., are divisions of the exposition by the author. Italicized letters following a number (518a, 518b) are subdivisions added by the Latin editor, S. H. Worcester. The critical notes were originally compiled by Worcester when he edited the Latin text for a Latin-English edition of Apocalypse Explained published by the Swedenborg Foundation between 1889 and 1897. These notes were used sparingly by Whitehead in this English edition, principally in cases where some difference in meaning is involved. All the notes, referenced by superscripts in the text, will be found at the end of the volume. William Ross Woofenden Sharon, Massachusetts"

And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that cometh up out of the abyss shall make war with them and overcome them and kill them. 8.

And they of the peoples and tribes and tongues and nations shall see their bodies three days and a half, and shall not suffer their bodies to be placed in sepulchers. 10. And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them and shall be glad, and shall send gifts one to another, because those two prophets tormented them that dwell upon the earth. 11.

Verse 1. And there was given to me a reed like a staff, signifies the mode of visitation, that is, of exploring the quality of the church in respect to truth and to good. This is evident from the signification of a “reed,” as being that by which the quality is explored, for “to measure” signifies to explore, and a “measure” signifies the quality of a thing; therefore, the “reed,” by which he measured the temple and the altar, as now follows, that is, the “measuring reed,” signifies the mode of exploring the quality. It means the mode of exploring what the quality of the church is in respect to truth and good, because it says afterwards that “he measured the temple and the altar, and them that worship therein,” which signifies the church in respect to truth and good, and thus in respect to worship. [2] Moreover, a “reed” signifies visitation, because visitation is an exploration of the quality of the men of the church, and because a visitation precedes the last judgment, which will be treated of hereafter. What is the nature of that visitation or exploration can be seen from the visitation upon Sodom, that in the first place angels were sent there, and through them visitation or exploration was made of what quality they were in respect to their reception, that is, what was their quality in respect to the reception of Divine truth and Divine good, for these angels represented the Lord in respect to the Divine proceeding; and when it was found that all in Sodom except Lot were unwilling to receive them but wished to do them harm, then their destruction came, which means their last judgment."

      "text": "APOCALYPSE EXPLAINED 2040 [3] The measuring was effected by a reed, because a “reed or cane” signifies Divine truth in the ultimate of order, and a “staff,” which the reed was like, signifies power; and by means of truth in the ultimate of order and its power all visitation or exploration is effected; for in the ultimate all truths, even from their firsts, form what is simultaneous, that is, coexist; therefore all things effected by the Divine, are effected from firsts by means of ultimates, therefore here visitation or exploration is so effected, and such truth is signified by a “reed or cane.” [4] So in the following passages. In Revelation: One of the seven angels had a golden reed, with which he measured the city Jerusalem and its gates and its wall; and he measured the city with a reed unto twelve thousand stadia (Rev. 21:15, 16). And in Ezekiel: In the hand of the angel there was a line of flax and a measuring reed, and the reed was of six cubits, and with it he measured the length, the breadth and the height of the building, of the gate, of the porch, of the court, of the temple, and many other things (Ezek. 40:3, 5, 6, 8, 11, 13, 17, et seq.; 41:1–5, 13, 14, 22; 42:1 to the end). Here, too, the “measuring reed” means the mode of exploring the church in respect to truth and good, as can be seen from this, that the angel measured every particular of the temple as to length, breadth, and height; and “length” signifies good, “breadth” truth, and “height” the degrees of good and truth from the highest or inmost to the lowest or ultimate. (On this signification of “length and breadth,” see the work Heaven and Hell, n. 197.) That a “reed” signifies truth in ultimates whereby explorations are effected, is evident also from this, that there was also a “line of flax” in the hand of the angel, “a line of flax” signifying truth; also from this, that “the reed was of six cubits,” “six” having a similar signification as “three,” namely, truths in the whole complex (see above, n. 384, 532). That “to measure” signifies to explore the quality of a thing will be seen in the following article."

      "text": "APOCALYPSE EXPLAINED 2041 [5] By ultimate truth, or truth in the ultimate of order, is meant sensual truth, such as the truth in the sense of the letter of the Word is to those who are merely sensual. Divine truth in its descent proceeds according to degrees, from the highest or inmost to the lowest or ultimate. Divine truth in the highest degree is such as is the Divine that proceeds most nearly from the Lord, thus such as is the Divine truth above the heavens; and as this is infinite, it cannot come to the perception of any angel. But Divine truth of the first degree is that which comes to the perception of the angels of the inmost or third heaven, and is called celestial Divine truth; from this is the wisdom of those angels. Divine truth of the second degree is that which comes to the perception of the angels of the middle or second heaven, and constitutes their wisdom and intelligence, and is called spiritual Divine truth. Divine truth of the third degree is that which comes to the perception of angels of the lowest or first heaven, and constitutes their intelligence and knowledge (scientia), and is called celestial-natural and spiritual- natural Divine truth. But Divine truth of the fourth degree is that which comes to the perception of the men of the church who are living in the world, and constitutes their intelligence and knowledge; this is called natural Divine truth, and its lowest is called sensual Divine truth. [6] These Divine truths are in the Word in the order of their degrees, and Divine truth in the lowest degree, or in the ultimate of order, is such as is the Divine truth in the sense of the letter of the Word, for children and for the very simple, who are sensual. This Divine truth is what is signified by a “reed or cane.” And as explorations with all are effected by this lowest Divine truth, as was said above, so measurings and weighings in the representative churches were made by means of reeds or canes, which signify such Divine truth. It has just been shown that measurings were made by reeds; that weighings were also thus made can be seen in Isaiah: They weighed silver with a reed (Isa. 46:6)."

This treats of the Lord; and “a bruised reed He will not break” signifies that He will not hurt sensual Divine truth with the simple and with children; “smoking flax He will not quench” signifies that He will not destroy the Divine truth that is beginning to live from a very little good of love with the simple and with children, “flax” signifying truth, and “smoking” signifies its being alive from some little love; and because both, that is, the “reed and flax” signify truth, it is said that the Lord “will bring forth truth into judgment,” which means that He will bring forth with them intelligence, “judgment” signifying intelligence. 627b. [8] A “reed” signifies also sensual truth which is the lowest, such as exists with natural men, even with the evil. In the same: The dry place shall become a pool, and there shall be grass instead of the reed and rush (Isa. 35:7). This refers to the establishment of the church by the Lord; and that those will then have intelligence through spiritual Divine truth who before had none is signified by “the dry place shall become a pool”; and that those will then have knowledge through natural Divine truth who before had only sensual truth, is signified by “there shall be grass instead of the reed and rush,” “grass” signifying knowledge from a spiritual origin, or by which spiritual truth is confirmed, while “reed and rush” signify knowledge from a sensual origin, or by which the fallacies of the senses are confirmed. This knowledge, regarded in itself, is only the lowest natural knowledge, which may be called material and corporeal, in which there is little or nothing of life. [9] In the same:"

      "text": "APOCALYPSE EXPLAINED 2043 The streams shall recede, the rivers of Egypt shall be minished and dried up, the reed and flag shall wither (Isa. 19:6). In the spiritual sense these words mean that all the understanding of Divine truth will perish; “the streams shall recede” signifies that all things of spiritual intelligence will depart; “the rivers of Egypt shall be minished and dried up” signifies that all things of natural intelligence will perish; “the reed and the flag shall wither” signifies that lowest truth, which is called sensual truth, and which is mere knowledge, will vanish; “streams and rivers” signifying the things of intelligence; “Egypt” the natural; “reed and flag” sensual truth or knowledge, and “to recede,” “to be minished,” “to be dried up,” and “to wither,” signifying to perish and disappear. [10] In the same: Thou hast trusted on the staff of this bruised reed, on Egypt, upon which when a man leaneth it goeth into his hand and pierceth it; so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that trust on him (Isa. 36:6). “Egypt” signifies the natural man separated from the spiritual, and its knowledge; when this is separated from the intelligence of the spiritual man it is fatuous, and is applied to confirm evils of every kind, consequently it is a false knowledge. This is what is called “a staff of a bruised reed,” “reed,” as was said, being truth in the ultimate of order, which is sensual knowledge; “bruised” signifies what is broken and not cohering with any interior truth to give it consistency; “staff” means the resulting power to perceive and also to reason about truths. This, therefore, is the meaning of “upon which when a man leaneth it goeth into his hand and pierceth it”; “to lean upon that staff” means to trust in one’s own power to perceive truths and reason about them from what is one’s own [proprium]; “to enter into the hand and pierce it” signifies to destroy all intellectual power, and to see mere falsities instead of truths and to seize upon them; “so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that trust on him” signifies that such is the natural man when separated from the spiritual, in respect to its knowledges and intelligence therefrom, and reasoning from that intelligence."

Have I made gold my hope, and said to pure gold, Thou art my confidence? (Job 31:22–24) This, too, treats of the confidence of self-intelligence, and in the spiritual sense these words describe that from this nothing of truth is seen, but only what is false, which does not cohere with any truth; noncoherence is signified by “let my shoulder blade fall from the shoulder, and mine arm be broken therefrom by a reed,” “shoulder blade,” “shoulder,” and “arm” signifying power, here the power to understand and perceive truth; “to fall from the shoulder,” and “to be broken by a reed” signifies to be separated from the spiritual power to perceive truth, and in consequence to be deceived by the sensual-corporeal man, and to perish by falsity, “reed” meaning truth in the ultimate of order, which is called sensual knowledge, which becomes mere falsity when it is of the natural man alone separated from the spiritual; “the dread of the destruction of God” signifies the loss of all understanding of truth; “by reason of His majesty to be able to do nothing” signifies that nothing of the understanding and perception of truth is from what is man’s own [proprium], but all from God; “to make gold a hope, and to say to pure gold, Thou art my confidence,” signifies that he confided not in himself, by believing anything of good to be from himself.

[13] In David: Rebuke the wild beast of the reed or cane, the congregation of the mighty, among the calves of the peoples; trampling upon the plates of silver, he hath scattered the peoples, he desireth wars; those that are fat shall come out of Egypt, Ethiopia shall hasten her gift1 unto God (Ps. 68:30, 31). This treats of the Lord’s kingdom. To beware of false knowledge, that is, of falsely applied knowledge from the natural man separated from the spiritual, is meant by “Rebuke the wild beast of the reed, cane or rod”; inasmuch as such knowledges, because they are from the fallacies of the senses, strongly persuade, they are called “the congregation of the mighty”; “the calves of the people” mean the goods of the church in the natural man; “plates of silver” are the truths of the church; “to tread upon” and “to scatter” mean to disperse and dissipate, which is done by those who are natural and sensual, and who think naturally and sensually, and not at the same time spiritually, thus who think from the natural and sensual man separated from the spiritual; this man is meant by “the wild beast of the reed” or “cane”; “to desire wars” signifies reasonings against truths; “those that are fat out of Egypt and Ethiopia” are those who have a knowledge of spiritual things, and who are in the cognitions of truth and good, who will draw near to the Lord’s kingdom because they are in light from the spiritual man."

The vastation of the church among the sons of Israel is compared to “the nodding of a reed or cane in the waters,” because a “reed” or cane signifies the truth of the sensual man, which is the lowest, and when this truth is separated from the light of the spiritual man it becomes falsity. For the sensual man derives all that it has from things appearing in the world; consequently reasonings from these respecting spiritual things are mere fallacies, and from fallacies come falsities. (What the fallacies of the senses are in spiritual things, and that falsities are from them, see in the New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine, n. 53; also above in the explanation of Revelation, n. 575; and that sensual knowledges are mere fallacies when the sensual man reasons from them, above, n. 569c, 581a; also what the sensual is, and the quality of the sensual man, see the New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine, n. 50.) 627c.

Those who do not know the spiritual sense of the Word may believe that these and the many other things related of the Lord’s passion involve nothing more than common modes of mockery; as that “they set a crown of thorns upon His head”; that “they parted His garments among them, but not the tunic”; that “they bent the knee before Him” for the sake of mocking Him; and also here, that “they placed a reed in His right hand, and afterwards smote His head with it”; and again, that “they filled a sponge with vinegar, or myrrhed wine, and set it upon a reed, and gave Him to drink.” But"

For they applied all things of the Word to their own loves, and derided every truth that disagreed with their loves, as they did the Messiah Himself, because He did not, according to their explanation and religion, become king over the whole world, and exalt them into glory above all peoples and nations. (That all things related of the Lord’s passion signify such things, see above, n. 64, 83, 195c at the end.) But that “they placed a reed in the Lord’s hand and afterwards smote His head with it” signifies that they falsified Divine truth or the Word, and made an utter mockery of the understanding of truth and of Divine wisdom, a “reed” signifying falsity in what is most external (as above), and “to smite the head” signifying to reject and mock at the understanding of truth and Divine wisdom, which is what “the head of the Lord” signifies; and in “giving the Lord vinegar to drink,” which signifies what is falsified, they placed a sponge filled with it on a “reed,” which signifies falsity in what is most external, which is falsity sustaining. 628. And the angel stood near, saying, signifies the Lord’s will and command. This is evident from the signification of “to stand near,” as being here will (of which presently); also from the signification of “angel,” as being the Lord in respect to the Word (see above, n. 593); also from the signification of “saying,” as being, when the Lord speaks, command; for what the Lord says is to be done, or that anyone should do it, is a command. “The angel stood near” means here the Lord’s will, because in the spiritual world the thought, with the purpose, and will to see another, to speak with him, and to give him a command, causes the other to be present, that is, to stand near; for in that world there are no distances that are constant and thence measurable, as in the natural world; but likeness of affection and of thought thence causes presence, and unlikeness of these causes absence; this is the origin of all distances"

From this universal principle all distances, that is, all presence and absence among angels and spirits, exist; therefore when anyone desires to speak with another, that is, thinks about him from a purpose or wish to speak with him, that one immediately becomes present, or he is present with that one. (That this is so can be seen in the work Heaven and Hell, n. 191–199, where space in heaven is treated of.)

This is evident from the signification of “to measure,” as being to explore what the quality of a thing is (of which presently); from the signification of “temple,” as being in the highest sense the Lord’s Divine Human in relation to Divine truth, and in a relative sense heaven and the church in respect to Divine truth proceeding from the Lord (of which above, n. 220); from the signification of “altar,” as being in the highest sense the Lord’s Divine Human in relation to divine good, and in a relative sense heaven and the church in respect to Divine good proceeding from the Lord (of which also above, n. 391, 490, 496); and from the signification of “them that worship,” as being worship. “They that worship” signifies the worship of the Lord, because worship consists in the adoration of the Lord, and because in the spiritual sense nothing of person is meant, but only the thing abstracted from persons (of which see above, n. 99, 100, 270, 325, 625); this is why “they that worship” signifies adoration and worship. From this it can be seen that “Rise, measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that worship therein,” signifies to explore the church, what is its quality in respect to the reception of Divine truth and Divine good proceeding from the Lord, and thence in respect to worship."

[3] That “to measure” signifies to explore the quality of a thing, and to designate it, can be seen from the passages in the Word where “to measure” and “measures” are mentioned, as in the following in Ezekiel: The man that had the line of flax and the measuring reed in his hand measured the building, likewise the threshold of the gate, the porch of the gate in the house, the porch of the gate from the house, the door of the gate, the gate from the roof of the bedchamber, and many other things which he measured as to breadth, length, and height (Ezek. 40:3, 5, 6, 8, 11, 13, 17, et seq.); He measured the temple, the lintel over the door, the wall of the house, and the house itself, as to breadth and length (Ezek. 41:1–5, 13, 14, 22); He measured the inner court, and the things of that court (Ezek. 42); He measured the altar and the things of the altar (Ezek 43:13, et seq.). Moreover, the measures were designated in numbers, that is, how many reeds, how many cubits, and how many palms; which shows that “to measure” these does not mean to measure but to designate the quality of the thing, and this is designated by the several things measured, namely, the “building,” the “gate,” the “porch,” the “temple,” the “upper lintel,” the “wall,” the “court,” and the “altar.” “The building, the house, and the temple,” signify the church; “the door and the gate” signify truth that introduces; and"

These external things are what are signified by the “porch” without the house, and by “the court.” What the qualities of these things were to be is here designated by measures and numbers; for these chapters treat of the Lord’s church that was to come, and that is called the internal church, and this is thus described. Anyone can see that such measurements would be of no account unless each measurement signified something; but what each signifies can be seen from the signification of the thing measured, and its quality from the signification of the measure as expressed in number. [4] There are only three things that are measured, namely, breadth, length, and height; and “breadth” signifies the truth of the church, “length” the good of the church, and “height” both of these as to degrees; the degrees of truth and good are the quality of truth and good as interior or higher and as exterior or lower. Such is the signification of these three dimensions, because breadth is predicated of heaven from south to north, and length from east to west, and height from the third heaven which is in things highest to the first heaven which is in things lowest. And as those in heaven who dwell from south to north are in the truths of doctrine, so “breadth” signifies the truth of heaven or of the church; and as those who dwell in heaven from east to west are in the good of love, so “length” signifies the good of heaven or of the church; and as those who dwell in the third heaven, who are the most wise, are in things highest, while those who dwell in the first heaven, who are relatively simple, are in things lowest, so “height” signifies wisdom and intelligence as to their degrees. These things therefore are what are designated by measurements in general. [5] In the same:"

That “to measure the temple” or “house” signifies to investigate and explore what is the quality of the church in respect to truth and good, can be seen from its being said “that they may measure the form of the house, the goings out and the comings in thereof”; also “that they may keep all the form thereof”; which cannot mean the form of the temple merely in respect to form, but in respect to those things that are signified by the temple; for it is added “that they may be ashamed of their iniquities that they have done,” which signifies shame for departing from the laws and statutes of the church; therefore it is added, “that he may teach them all the statutes thereof, all the descriptions,2 and all the laws thereof”; which shows that the “temple” signifies the church with its truths and goods, for these are the things that are to be kept, and this is signified by “keeping all the form of the house” or “temple.” The “temple” signifies in the Word the church in respect to truth, and “the house of God” the church in respect to good; for the temple was of stone, but the house of God in ancient times was of wood; and “stones” signify truths, and “wood” signifies good.

This is said of the Lord’s coming and of the establishment of a new church by Him, as can be seen from verses 10 and 11 of the same chapter. “Jerusalem” signifies that new church, and “to measure” it signifies to explore and thus to know what and how great it will be; “breadth” signifies the truth of its doctrine, and “length” the good"

For the church of the Lord is internal and external; in the internal church are those who are in intelligence and wisdom, and thus in the higher heavens, but in the external church are those who are in knowledges and cognitions of truth and good from the Word, and in no interior intelligence and wisdom, and who are therefore in the lower heavens; the former are called spiritual, the latter spiritual-natural, and the spiritual are meant by those who are “in the midst of Jerusalem,” and the spiritual-natural by those who are “in the suburbs.” “Men and beasts” mean those who are in intelligence and thence in the good of life, “men” those who are in intelligence, and “beasts” those who are in the natural affection of good, and thus in the good of life. 629b. [7] Like things are signified by these words in Revelation: The angel who talked with me had a golden reed, to measure the city the New Jerusalem, the gates thereof and the wall thereof; and he measured the wall, a hundred and forty-four cubits, which is the measure of a man, that is, of an angel (Rev. 21:15, 17). Here, too, “the New Jerusalem” means a new church, and the “city” its doctrine, “its wall” signifies Divine truth defending, the number “one hundred and forty-four” signifies all truths and goods in the complex; this number is said to be “the measure of a man, that is, of an angel,” which could not be said unless “measure” signified quality.

And behold, on the bank of the river were many trees on this side and on that side; and every living soul that creepeth, and whithersoever the river cometh, shall live; whence there is much fish (Ezek. 47:3–5, 7, 9). This describes how intelligence, which those have who are of the church, increases by the reception of Divine truth proceeding from the Lord. Divine truth proceeding from the Lord is signified by “the waters issuing from under the threshold of the house towards the east, and going down from the right side of the house from the south of the altar,” as is said in verse 1 of this chapter; the “east” signifies love to the Lord, since the east in heaven is where the Lord appears as a sun; and thence the “right side” is where Divine truth is received in the greatest light, and that side is called the south; therefore it is added “from the south of the altar.” How intelligence increases by the reception of Divine truth proceeding from the Lord is described by the “waters” which the prophet passed through, which first reached “to the ankles,” afterwards “to the knees,” then “to the loins,” and at length were so high that they “could not be passed through”; “the waters to the ankles” signify such intelligence as the sensual and natural man has, for “ankles” signify what is sensual and natural; “the waters to the knees” signify such intelligence as the spiritual-natural man has, for “knees” signify what is spiritual-natural; “the waters to the loins” signify such intelligence as the spiritual man has, for the “loins” signify the marriage of truth and good, which is spiritual; “the waters that could not be passed through” signify celestial intelligence, which is called wisdom, such as the celestial man or an angel of the third heaven has; and because this is ineffable, it is said to be “a river that could not be passed through,” and because it is far above the natural man, these waters are called “waters of swimming.”"

(Isa. 40:10, 12) This, too, is said of the Lord and of Divine truth, from which are heaven and the church, and from which is wisdom. The Lord’s coming, and the arrangement of all things in the heavens by Him from His own power at that time, is signified by “Behold the Lord Jehovih cometh in strength, and His arm shall rule for Him,” “His arm that shall rule” signifying His own power. The arrangement of all things in the heavens by His own power by means of Divine truth, is signified by “Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of His hand, and meted out the heavens with a span, and embraced the dust of the earth in a measure and weighed the mountains in a scale, and the hills in a balance?” “To measure waters” signifies to define Divine truths; “to mete out the heavens with a span” signifies thence to arrange the heavens; “to embrace the dust of the earth in a measure” signifies to arrange lower things; “the hollow of the hand,” “the span,” and “the measure” have a similar signification as “measures” and also the “hand,” namely, the quality of a thing and one’s own power; “to weigh the mountains in a scale and the hills in a balance” signifies to subordinate and equilibrate all things, “scale and balance” signifying right equilibration, and “mountains and hills” the higher heavens, “mountains” meaning those heavens which are in love to the Lord, and “hills” those which are in charity towards the neighbor (as above).

[12] In Jeremiah: If these statutes shall depart from before Me, the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation before Me all the days. If the heavens shall be measured upwards, and the foundations be searched out downwards, I also will reject all the seed of Israel because of all that they have done (Jer. 31:36, 37). “Statutes” signify here all the things of the church that were commanded to the sons of Israel, thus all things of worship; if they do not keep these there will be no church among them, is what is signified by “If these statutes shall depart from before Me the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation before Me all the days,” “Israel” signifying the church, and “the seed of Israel” the truth of the church; and that although a new heaven and a new church will come into existence, yet there will be nothing of heaven and the church with that nation, is signified by “If the heavens shall be measured upwards, and the foundations shall be searched out downwards, I also will reject all the seed of Israel because of all that they have done.” 629c. [13] “To mete” and “to measure” signifies to define and determine what a thing is, also to explore it, because “measure” signifies what a thing is, or quality. That this is the signification of “measure” can be seen from the following passages. In Revelation: The angel measured the wall of the city New Jerusalem, a hundred and forty-four cubits, which is the measure of a man, that is, of an angel (Rev. 21:17). It is clearly evident that here “measure” signifies the quality of the thing that is meant by “the wall of the city New Jerusalem”; for what else could be meant by “the measure of the wall, a hundred"

In Matthew: Judge not that ye be not condemned3 for with what judgment ye judge ye shall be judged, and with what measure ye measure it shall be measured to you (Matt. 7:1, 2). In Luke: Judge not that ye be not judged; condemn not that ye be not condemned; remit and it shall be remitted to you; give and it shall be given to you, good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over, shall they give into your bosom; for with what measure ye measure they shall measure to you again (Luke 6:37, 38). This may be seen explained in the work Heaven and Hell (n. 349). And in Mark: With what measure ye measure it shall be measured to you again; and to you that hear, more shall be added. Whosoever hath, to him shall be given; but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he hath (Mark 4:24, 25). [14] Thus charity towards the neighbor, or the spiritual affection of truth and good, is described, namely, that in the measure and after the manner that anyone is in such charity or in such affection in the world, so he comes into it after death. That we should not think evil of good and truth is meant by the words, “Judge not that ye be not judged, and condemn not that ye be not condemned”; to think evil of what is evil and false is permitted to everyone, but not of good and truth, for these in the spiritual sense are the neighbor. Because it is charity toward the neighbor that is meant it is added, “Remit and it shall be remitted to you, give and it shall be given unto you.” That the spiritual affection, which is called charity, will continue after death according to its measure and quality, is meant by “With what measure ye measure it shall be measured to you again”; and that this measure and quality will be infilled to eternity is meant by “to you that hear a measure shall be added,” also by “good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over, shall be given into your bosom,” “measure” here meaning the measure and quality of affection or charity, which will be increased"

That this will come to pass with those who practice charity is meant by “to you that hear more shall be added,” “those that hear” signifying those who obey and do. That “to love the neighbor” is to love what is true and good, likewise what is sincere and just, may be seen in the New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine (n. 84–106). That no other thought or judgment is here meant than concerning the spiritual life of another can be seen from this, that it is permissible to everyone to think about the moral and civil life of another, and to judge of it; without such thought and judgment concerning others no civil society could subsist; therefore “not to judge and condemn” signifies not to think evil of the neighbor spiritually understood, that is, of his faith and love, which belong to man’s spiritual life, for these lie concealed in his interiors, and therefore are unknown to anyone except the Lord alone. [15] In John: He whom the Father hath sent speaketh the words of God, for not by measure hath God given the spirit unto Him (John 3:24). The “spirit” that God giveth signifies Divine truth, and intelligence and wisdom therefrom; “not by measure” signifies above every measure and quality of men, therefore infinitely, for the infinity that belongs to the Lord is without measure or quality, for measure and quality are properties of the finite, since measure and quality determine what is finite and set limits to it, but what is without limit is infinite. From this it follows that “measure” also here signifies quality, since “not by measure” signifies not predicating what a thing is, or its quality. [16] In David: Make known to me, Jehovah, my end, and the measure of my days what it is, that I may know how transitory I am; behold Thou hast given my days as handbreadths, and my time is as nothing before Thee (Ps. 39:4, 5)."

That there is such a meaning in these words cannot be seen by those who think only naturally, because natural thought cannot be separated from the idea of time. But spiritual thought, like that of angels, has nothing in common with time or space or with person. [17] As “measures” signify the quality of a thing, it is clear what is signified: By the house of measures (Jer. 22:14); By the portion of measures (Jer. 13:25); Also by men of measures (Isa. 45:14); where “measures” signify quality in the whole complex. In Moses: Ye shall not act perversely in judgment, in measure, in weight, or in dimension; balances of justice, stones of justice, an ephah of justice, and a hin of justice, shall ye have (Lev. 19:35, 36). In the same: Thou shalt not have in thy bag divers stones, great and small; thou shalt not have in thy house divers ephahs, great and small; a perfect and a just stone shalt thou have, a perfect and a just ephah shalt thou have (Deut. 25:13–15)."

And the court which is without the temple cast out, and measure it not, signifies that the external of the Word, and thence of the church and worship, is not to be explored. This is evident from the signification of the “court,” as being the external of the Word, and thence of the church and of worship. The “court” has this signification because the “temple” signifies heaven and the church in respect to Divine truth, as was said in the article above; therefore the “court” which was “outside the temple or in front of the temple” signifies the first or lowest heaven. For the “temple,” regarded in itself, signifies the higher heavens; that is, the “adytum,” where the ark of the covenant was, signified the inmost or third heaven, and “the temple outside of the adytum” signified the middle or second heaven; therefore the “court” signified the lowest or first heaven; and what signifies heaven signifies also the church, for the church is the Lord’s heaven on the earth; and what signifies the church, signifies also the Word and worship, for the Word is the Divine truth, from which are heaven and the church, and worship is according to Divine truth, which is the Word. From this it is that the “court” signifies the external or ultimate of heaven and the church, and also the external or ultimate of the Word and of worship. [2] The Word and worship are altogether as heaven and the church are; for as there are three heavens, so in the Word there are three distinct senses: the inmost sense, which is called the celestial sense, is for the inmost or third heaven; the middle sense, which is called the spiritual sense, is for the middle or second heaven; and the ultimate sense, which is called the celestial-natural and spiritual-natural sense, is for the lowest or first heaven.

This is why the “court” signifies the external of the Word, and thence the external of the church and of worship. [3] Moreover, it is to be known that the temple had two courts, one without the temple, and the other within, and “the court without the temple” signifies the entrance itself into heaven and into the church, in which are those who are being introduced into heaven; while “the court within the temple” represented the lowest heaven. It is similar with the church, also with the Word and with worship; for “the court without the temple” signifies the external of the Word, that is, the Word such as it is in the natural sense, which is for the world, by which man is introduced into its spiritual sense, in which the angels of heaven are. But what is properly signified by each court, the inner and the outer, will be told in what follows. Also, why it is here said that “the court without the temple is to be cast out, and not measured,” will be told in the following article, where it is told what is signified by “it is given to the nations.” 630b.

This court was the court of the Tent of meeting, which likewise represented and signified the lowest or first heaven; for “the Tent of meeting” represented heaven; its inmost, where the ark was, over which was the mercy seat, represented the inmost or third heaven; the law in the ark, the Lord Himself as to Divine truth or the Word; and the tent without the veil, where was the table for the loaves, the altar of incense, and the lamp stand, represented the"

[5] As the court represented the lowest heaven, and thence also the external of the church, of the Word, and of worship: The residue of the meal offerings and of the sacrifices for sin were eaten by Aaron and his sons in the court (Lev. 6:16, 26). “Eating in the court” these sanctified things signified appropriating to oneself the goods of the church that were signified by the meal offerings and these sacrifices; and all appropriation of holy things is effected by ultimates, for except through ultimates there can be no appropriation of interior holy things. [6] But the courts of the temple are thus described in the first book of Kings: Solomon made a court before the front of the house of the temple. And afterwards he built the inner court, three layers of hewn stones and a row of hewn cedar (1 Kings 6:3, 36). The temple in like manner represented heaven and the church; the adytum, where the ark was, represented the inmost or third heaven, also the church with those who are in inmosts, which is called the celestial church; the temple outside the adytum represented the middle or second heaven, also the church with those who are in the middle, which is called the internal spiritual church; the inner court represented the lowest or first heaven, also the church with those who are in ultimates, which is called the internal-natural church; while the outer court represented the entrance into heaven.

These words mean that every Divine truth, consequently everything of the church, is to perish; for the end of the church, which is called the consummation of the age, is here treated of. [8] That there were two courts built, an inner and an outer, and there little chambers, porticos, or piazzas, and many other things, can be seen from the description of them in Ezekiel: The angel brought me to the outer court, where, behold, there were chambers and a pavement made for the court round about, thirty chambers upon the pavement, which he measured as to the length and the breadth; and he also measured the bedchambers, the portico, the gate, everything as to length and breadth (Ezek. 40:17–22, 31, 34, et seq.; 42:1–14). And of the inner court it is said in the same: That he measured the inner court, the gates thereof towards the north, the east, and the south; the portico, the steps with the ascents, the bedchambers, the chambers of the singers, the upper lintels (Ezek. 40:23–31, 44, et seq.).

In the prophet Ezekiel, from chap. 40 to chap. 48, a new city, a new temple, and a new earth, are treated of, which signify a new church that was to be established by the Lord; and the “chambers,” the “bedchambers,” the “porticos,” and the rest, signify such things as belong to the church, its doctrine and worship; and their dimensions signify their quality (as was said and shown in the article above). But this is not the place to explain what is signified by the particulars; only that “courts” signify the external things of heaven and of the church, and thence the externals of the Word and of worship. That the externals of these are signified by the “courts” is evident from this alone, that the “temple” in general signifies heaven and the church, therefore the three divisions of the temple, namely, the courts, the temple itself, and the adytum, signify the three heavens according to their degrees. (Of what nature the three heavens are according to their degrees, see in the work Heaven and Hell, n. 29–40.) 630c. [9] That “the temple and the courts” signify heaven and the church can be seen more fully from these words in Ezekiel: The spirit raised me up and brought me into the inner court of the temple, when behold, the glory of Jehovah filled the house; and I heard one speaking unto me out of the house, saying, Son of man, the place of My throne, and the place of the soles of My feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the sons of Israel forever (Ezek. 43:4–7). That these “courts” signify the lowest heaven, or the external of the church, can be seen from its being said that “he was brought into the court, and thence saw the house filled with the glory of Jehovah,” “the glory of Jehovah” signifying Divine truth, which constitutes heaven and the church; also afterwards, that that house was “the place of the throne of Jehovah, and the place of the soles of His feet, where He will dwell in the midst of the sons of Israel forever.” That “the throne of Jehovah” means heaven may be seen above (n. 253, 297, 343, 460, 462, 477, 482); and that “the place of the soles of the feet of Jehovah” means the church, see also above"

[10] In the same: The glory of Jehovah lifted itself up from above the cherub over the threshold of the house, and the house was filled with the cloud. And the cloud filled the inner court. And the court was full of the brightness of the glory of Jehovah; and the voice of the wings of the cherubim was heard even to the outer court (Ezek. 10:3, 4, 5). The “cherubim” seen by the prophet represented the Lord in relation to providence and guard that He be not approached except through good of love; consequently the “cherubim” signify the higher heavens, particularly the inmost heaven, for this guard is there (see above n. 277, 313, 322, 362, 370, 462); therefore the “house that was filled with the cloud” signifies heaven and the church; the “inner court,” which the cloud also filled, signifies the lowest heaven; and the “outer court,” as far as which the voice of the wings of the cherubs was heard, signifies the entrance into heaven, which is specifically in the natural world, and afterwards in the world of spirits. For through the church in the world, and afterwards through the world of spirits, man enters into heaven. (What the world of spirits is, see in the work Heaven and Hell, n. 421–431 seq.) But the “cloud” and “the brightness of the glory of Jehovah” signify the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord. [11] From this it can now be seen what is signified by “courts” in the following passages. In David: Blessed is he whom thou choosest and causest to approach, he shall dwell in Thy courts; we shall be satisfied with the goodness of Thy house, with the holiness of Thy temple (Ps. 65:4). This signifies that those who are in charity, or in spiritual affection, will live in heaven, and there will be in intelligence and wisdom from Divine truth and Divine good; “the chosen“ (or he whom thou choosest) signifies those who are in love towards the neighbor"

[12] In the same: A day in Thy courts is better than thousands, I have chosen to stand at the door in the house of my God (Ps. 84:10). “Courts” here signify the first or lowest heaven, through which there is entrance into the higher heavens; therefore it is added, “I have chosen to stand at the door in the house of my God.” In the same: Give to Jehovah the glory of His name, bring an offering, and come into His courts (Ps. 96:8).

Planted in the house of Jehovah they shall spring forth in the courts of our God (Ps. 92:12, 13). That in these passages “courts” mean heaven, in particular the lowest heaven and the church, can be seen without explanation. [13] Likewise in the following passages. In Isaiah: They shall gather the corn and the new wine, they shall eat and shall praise Jehovah, and they that shall bring it together shall drink in the courts of My holiness (Isa. 62:9). “They shall gather the corn and the new wine” signifies instruction in the goods and truths of doctrine and of the church; “they shall eat and shall praise Jehovah” signifies appropriation and the worship of the Lord; “they that shall bring it together shall drink in the courts of My holiness” signifies the enjoyment of Divine truth, and the consequent happiness in the heavens. [14] In Joel: Let the priests, the ministers of Jehovah, weep between the court and the altar, and let them say, Spare Thy people, O Jehovah (Joel 2:17); “weeping between the court and the altar” signifies lamentation over the vastation of Divine truth and Divine good in the church; for the “court” has a similar signification as the “temple,” namely, the church in respect to Divine truth, and the “altar” signifies the church in respect to Divine good; therefore “between the court and the altar” signifies the marriage of good and truth, which constitutes heaven and the church; and “to weep” signifies lamentation over its vastation. “Courts” also elsewhere in the Word signify the ultimates of heaven, also the externals of the church, of the Word, and of worship (as in Isa. 1:12; Zech. 3:7). 631.

(That evils and falsities are signified by “nations” see above, n. 175b, 331b, 625.) The external of the Word and thence of the church and of worship is perverted by evils of life and falsities of doctrine, because the external of the Word, which is called the sense of its letter, is written according to appearances in the world, because it is for children and the simple-minded, who have no perception of anything contrary to appearances, therefore as these advance in age they are introduced by the sense of the letter, in which are appearances of truth, into interior truths, and thus appearances are put off by degrees, and in their place interior truths are implanted. This may be illustrated by numberless examples; as that we should pray to God not to lead us into temptations; this is said because it appears as if God so leads, and yet God leads no one into temptations; again, it is said that God is angry, punishes, casts into hell, brings evil upon the wicked, and many other like things, and yet God is never angry, never punishes or casts into hell, nor does He at all do evil to anyone, but the wrongdoer himself does this to himself by his evils, for in evils themselves are the evils of punishment. These things are nevertheless said in many passages in the Word, because it so appears. As another example, it is said that: No one should call his father, Father; nor his master, Master (Matt. 23:8–10). Yet they ought to be so called; but this is said because the “Father” means the Lord, who creates and begets us anew, and because He alone teaches and instructs; so when man is in a spiritual idea he will think of the Lord alone as the Father and Master; but it is otherwise when man is in a natural idea. Moreover, in the spiritual world or in heaven, no one knows any other father, teacher, or master than the Lord, because from Him is spiritual life. So in other instances. [2] From this it can be seen that the external of the Word, and thence the external of the church and of worship, consists of apparent truths, therefore those who are in evils in respect to life apply it to favor their own loves and the principles conceived"

This is why it is said that the “court,” which signifies the external of the Word, “is given to the nations,” and afterwards that “they shall trample down the holy city.” This comes to pass in the end of the church, when men are so far worldly, natural, and corporeal that they are wholly unable to see interior truths, which are called spiritual truths; and from this it follows that they then wholly pervert the external of the Word, which is the sense of its letter. Such perversion of the sense of the letter of the Word took place also with the Jews at the end of the church with them, which is meant in the spiritual sense by: The soldiers dividing the garments of the Lord, but not the tunic (John 19:23, 24), which signifies that those who were of the church perverted all things of the Word in respect to the sense of its letter, but not the Word in respect to the spiritual sense, because this they did not know. (That this is what these things mean in the spiritual sense may be seen above, n. 64.) It is similar in the church at this day, because this is its end; for at this day the Word is not explained according to spiritual truths, but according to the appearances of the sense of the letter, which are applied to confirm both evils of life and falsities of doctrine; and because interior truths, which are spiritual truths, are unknown and are not received, it follows that the sense of the letter of the Word is perverted by evils of the will and falsities of thought therefrom. This, therefore, is what is meant by “the court is given to the nations.” 632. And the holy city shall they trample down, signifies that they will destroy all the doctrine of good and truth from the Word. This is evident from the signification of “the holy city,” as being the doctrine of truth and good from the Word; in the sense of the letter “the holy city” means Jerusalem, which in the Word here and there is called “the holy city”; but “Jerusalem” means the church, and a “city” the doctrine of the church; that a “city” [civitas or urbs] signifies doctrine, see above (n. 223); therefore “the holy city” signifies the doctrine of Divine truth, for Divine truth is what is called “holy” in the Word (n. 204).

That this signification of “soles” and of “feet” is from correspondence, see above (n. 65, 606; and in the work Heaven and Hell, n. 96). [2] It is said that “the nations shall trample down the holy city,” because this follows after the words, “The court which is without the temple cast out, for it is given to the nations,” and the “court” signifies the external of the Word, of the church, and of worship, and the external of the Word is what is perverted, and thus adulterated and falsified, by the nations, that is, by those who are in evils and falsities. For, as was said in the preceding article, the external of the Word, which is called the sense of its letter, is for children and the simple-minded, and is therefore written according to appearances, thus for those who are sensual and natural; for infants are first sensual, afterwards natural, and when they advance in age they become spiritual. But when a man does not become spiritual, as is the case with all who live in evil, he does not understand the Word spiritually, but only naturally and sensually, and he who so understands the Word perverts it, and explains it according to the falsities of his religion and according to the evils of his life. This is why it is said that “they shall trample it down.” Moreover, those who deny and despise the truths of heaven and the church appear in the spiritual world to trample them under the soles of the feet, and this, as was said above, because the external sensual of man corresponds to the soles of the feet, which are what trample down. It is said that the external sensual of man does this, but it is the sensual of those only who are merely sensual, who are such as deny the truths of heaven and the church, and who also believe nothing except what they can see with their eyes and touch with their hands. [3] “To trample down” is predicated of such in the following passages also. In Luke:"

This has a similar signification as the passage in Revelation here explained, that “the court is given to the nations, and the holy city shall they trample down forty-two months”; for “they shall fall by the edge of the sword” signifies that they shall perish by falsities; “they shall be led captive among all nations” signifies that evils will make a prey of the goods and truths of the church; “Jerusalem shall be trampled down” signifies the destruction of the church in respect to doctrine; for “Jerusalem” signifies the church in respect to doctrine; “its being trampled down by the nations” signifies the total destruction of the church by evils of life and falsities of doctrine; “until the time of the nations shall be fulfilled” signifies until evil is consummated (see above, n. 624a); this consummation is also signified by the “forty-two months.” This, too, like what is said in Revelation, was said by the Lord respecting the time just preceding the last judgment. [4] In Ezekiel: Is this a small thing to you? Ye feed upon the good pasture, and trample down with your feet the remainder of your pastures; ye drink the sediment of the waters, ye stir up the remainder with your feet; and thus my flock feeds upon what ye have trampled down with your feet, and drink that which is stirred up by your feet (Ezek. 34:18, 19). “Good pasture” signifies all that which spiritually nourishes, especially the Word and the knowledges of truth and good therefrom; “to feed upon it and to trample down the remainder with the feet” signifies to so do away with it that it does not appear, and to so destroy it that it is not, and this is done by reasonings from the corporeal-sensual, and from the natural man separated from the spiritual. This therefore is what is meant by “trampling down with the feet”; “the sediment of the waters” signify truths defiled by falsities, for “waters” mean truths, and “to drink thereof” signifies to learn and to receive; “to stir up the remainder of the waters with the feet” signifies to bring nevertheless into confusion"

The “he-goat” here signifies faith separated from charity, and the “ram” signifies faith conjoined to charity, thus charity, the same as the “he-goats and sheep” in Matthew 25:31–46; “the one horn that waxed great from a little one” signifies justification by faith alone; “the host of the heavens” signifies all truths and goods of heaven and the church, and the “stars” signify the knowledges of good and truth; therefore “to trample down the ram” and also “the host of the heavens” signifies to destroy charity utterly, and with it all the truths and goods of heaven and the church, and this by the corporeal-sensual; for they who are in faith separated from charity, that is, who believe that they are saved by faith alone whatever their life may be, become corporeal-sensual, and are consequently in falsities in respect to all things of the Word and of the church; for they have no perception of the Word otherwise than according to the ultimate sense of its letter, seeing nothing interiorly in it; and even if they speak truths from the Word they nevertheless perceive them falsely; therefore this is what is signified by “the he-goat cast down to the earth some of the host of the heavens and some of the stars, and trampled them down.” That charity towards the neighbor, that is, the good of life, is in like manner destroyed, is meant by “the he-goat cast the ram to the earth and trampled him down”; for they who are in faith separated from charity, who are meant by the “he-goat,” make faith the essential and charity the nonessential, therefore they live for the body and the world, and are solicitous about themselves only, and not at all about the neighbor;"

In Luke: Behold I give you authority to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy, that nothing may by any means hurt you (Luke 10:19). This is so said in the Word because those who are in the hells appear before the eyes of good spirits and angels sometimes in the forms of various beasts and serpents, according to the kind of evil and of falsity therefrom in which they are; their thoughts themselves, when they go forth from the intention of their will, present such appearances. Exhalations from their evils and falsities continually breathe forth through the lands that are over these hells, or by which these hells are covered; so that to walk upon such places is dangerous to those who are only natural, and still more to those who are corporeal-sensual; for an exhalation arises therefrom, and a contagion affects those who walk there. But those who are led by the Lord may safely tread upon that earth without infection or infestation, because the interiors that are of their mind, or of their thought and affection, are elevated by the Lord above their corporeal-sensual, which corresponds to the soles of the feet.

This is evident also from the signification of “forty-two” as being the end of the former church and the beginning of the new; this is the signification of that number, because it means six weeks, and “six weeks” has a similar signification as the “six days” of one week, namely, a state of combat and labor, and thus the end when the church is altogether vastated, or when evil is consummated; and “the seventh week” which then follows signifies the beginning of a new church; for the number “forty-two” arises from the multiplication of six into seven, six times seven making forty-two, therefore “forty-two” has a similar signification as “six weeks,” and “six weeks” something similar to the “six days” of one week, namely, a state of combat and labor, as was said, and also a full state, here the full consummation of good and truth, that is, the full vastation of the church. 633b. [2] In the Word mention is sometimes made of “forty,” sometimes days, sometimes months, sometimes years, and that number signifies either the full vastation of the church, or a complete temptation. That this state is signified by the numbers “forty” and “forty-two,” can be seen from the following passages.

At the end of forty years I will bring together Egypt from the peoples, whither they were scattered, and will bring back the captivity of Egypt (Ezek. 29:11–14). “Egypt” signifies the church in respect to true knowledges, upon which doctrine is based. True knowledges at that time were the knowledges of correspondences and representations, upon which the doctrine of their church was based. But because the Egyptians turned these knowledges into magic, and thus perverted the church, its vastation is described, which is meant by “forty years”; this, therefore, is the signification of “Egypt shall not be inhabited"

This makes clear that “forty years” signifies a state of full vastation of the church, or even to its end, when there will be no more good or truth remaining. But the beginning of a new church, which is signified by “the end of forty years,” is meant by these words, “at the end of forty years I will bring together Egypt from the peoples whither they were scattered, and will bring back the captivity of Egypt.” [3] In the same prophecy: That the prophet should lie on his right side forty days, and lay siege to Jerusalem, which shall want bread and water, and be desolated, a man and his brother, and pine away for its iniquity (Ezek. 4:6, 7, 17); has a similar signification. The full vastation of the church is also here signified by that number; “Jerusalem” signifies the church; “to lay siege to it” signifies to distress the church by evils and falsities; “to want bread and water” signifies to be vastated in respect to the good of love and the truth of doctrine; “to be desolated, a man and his brother, and to pine away for iniquity,” has a similar signification, for “man and his brother” mean truth and charity, and “to pine away” means to die out. [4] The “forty days” of the flood have a similar signification in Genesis: For yet seven days I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights, and I will destroy all substance that I have made from upon the faces of the earth. And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights, then after seven days he sent forth a dove, which did not return unto him (Gen. 7:4, 12; 8:6, 12). The “flood” signifies the devastation of the old or most ancient church, likewise the last judgment upon those who were of that church; “the rain of forty days” signifies the ruin of that church by the falsities of evil; but the beginning of a new church is signified by the drying up of the earth after those forty days, and by its sprouting up anew; the “dove” that he sent out signifies the good of"

[5] The law in Moses: That the wicked man might be smitten with forty stripes, and no more lest thy brother seem vile in thine eyes (Deut. 25:3); originated in this signification of the number “forty.” Full punishment as well as vastation is described by “forty,” since punishment is equally the consummation of evil; and as reformation follows after punishment, it is said that he should not be smitten with more stripes, “lest thy brother seem vile in thine eyes”; for “forty” signifies the end of evil, and also the beginning of good, therefore if he were smitten with more than forty stripes the beginning of good, or reformation, would not be signified. [6] The vastation of the church with the sons of Jacob by a servitude of four hundred years in Egypt is signified by the words of Jehovah to Abraham: Know that thy seed shall be a sojourner in a land not theirs, where they shall subject them to servitude four hundred years (Gen. 15:13). “Four hundred” has a similar signification as “forty,” just as one “thousand” has a similar signification as one “hundred,” and one “hundred” as “ten.” [7] The vastation of the church and also full temptation are signified by the tarrying of the sons of Israel forty years in the wilderness, which is thus spoken of in the following passages: Your sons shall be shepherds in the wilderness forty years, and shall bear your whoredoms even till your carcasses are consumed7 in the wilderness (Num. 14:33, 34)."

Thou shalt remember all the way which Jehovah thy God led thee these forty years in the wilderness, that He might afflict thee and tempt thee; He fed thee with manna; to afflict thee, to tempt thee, and to do thee good at the last (Deut. 8:2, 3, 15, 16). Your fathers tempted Me, they proved Me; forty years I loathed this generation, and I said, It is a people that do err in heart, and they have not known My ways (Ps. 95:9, 10). I have made you to come up out of the land of Egypt, and I have led you in the wilderness forty years to possess the land of the Amorites (Amos 2:10). From what has been cited it is clear that “forty years” signifies not only the vastation of the church with the sons of Israel, but also full temptation; also “the end of those years” signifies the beginning of a new church. The vastation of the church is described by these words, that “they should be shepherds in the wilderness forty years, and should bear whoredoms, even till their carcasses should be consumed; also by these, “until all this generation that had done evil in the eyes of Jehovah was consumed”; also by these, “I loathed this generation, and I said, It is a people that do err in heart, and they have not known My ways.” But the temptation that is also signified by “forty years” is described by these words, “Jehovah thy God hath been with thee these forty years, that thou lackedst nothing”; also by these, “Jehovah led thee forty years in the wilderness, that He might afflict thee and tempt thee; and He fed thee with manna”; also by these, “He led thee in the wilderness to tempt thee, and to do thee good at the last.” The beginning of a new church, after the end of the forty years, is described by their introduction into the land of Canaan, which took place after these forty years; and this is also meant by these words, “to do thee good"

In like manner that Jesus was in the wilderness, tempted by the devil, and fasted there forty days (Matt. 4:1, 2; Mark 1:13; Luke 4:1). 633c. From this it can be seen that the number “forty” in the Word signifies full vastation and consummation, that is, when all the good of the church is vastated and the evil is consummated; also that the same number signifies full temptation, and also the establishment of the church anew, or reformation. From this it can be known what is signified by “the forty-two months during which the nations trampled down the holy city,” likewise by the following in Revelation: That there was given to the beast coming up out of the sea a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies, and there was given to him authority forty-two months (Rev. 13:1, 5). Let no one, therefore, believe that “forty-two months” mean months, or that any time designated by numbers is meant here and in what follows. 634. Verses 3, 4.

Verse 3. And I will give unto my two witnesses, signifies the good of love and charity and the truth of doctrine and faith, both from the Lord. This is evident from the signification of “witnesses,” as being those who in heart and faith acknowledge and confess the Lord, His Divine in His Human, and His proceeding Divine; for this is what essentially bears witness respecting the Lord, that is, acknowledges, and from acknowledgment confesses Him. (Respecting the signification of “witness” and “bearing witness,” see above, n. 10, 27, 228, 392.) “The two witnesses” here signify the good of love and charity, and the truth of doctrine and faith, for it follows that “the two witnesses are the two olive trees and the two lamp stands”; “the two olive trees” signify the good of love to God and the good of charity towards the neighbor; and “the two lamp stands” signify the truth of doctrine and the truth of faith (on the signification of these more presently). [2] These goods and truths are meant by the “witnesses,” because they, that is, all who are in them, acknowledge and confess the Lord, for it is the Divine proceeding that is called the Divine good and the Divine truth, whence is the good of love to God and the good of charity towards the neighbor, and the truth of doctrine and the truth of faith thence, which bear witness concerning Him; from which it follows that those who are in these likewise bear witness concerning the Lord, that is, acknowledge and confess Him. For it is the Divine that bears witness concerning the Divine, and not man from himself; consequently the Lord is in the good of love, and in the truth of doctrine therefrom, that are in man, and it is these that bear witness.

In John: Search the Scriptures, for they are they which bear witness of Me (John 5:39). The Sacred Scriptures or the Word is the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord, and the Divine proceeding is the Lord Himself in heaven and in the church; so when it is said that “the Scriptures bear witness of Him” it is meant that the Lord Himself bears witness respecting Himself. In the same: I am He that beareth witness of Myself, and the Father that sent Me beareth witness of Me (John 8:18). Here it is openly declared that the Lord Himself, or the Divine in Him, bears witness of Him. [4] In the same: Jesus said, When the Paraclete is come, the spirit of truth, he shall bear witness of Me (John 15:26, 27). “The Paraclete, the spirit of truth,” means the Divine proceeding from the Lord, which is the Divine truth. In the same: Jesus said to Pilate, Thou sayest it, because I am King; for this have I come into the world, that I might give testimony to the truth (John 18:37). “To give testimony to the truth” signifies to cause the Divine truth proceeding from Him to bear witness of Him; moreover, this Divine truth is signified in the Word by “king.” These passages are cited to make known that “to bear witness” means to acknowledge and confess the Lord, and that this is from Him; consequently “to bear witness” means the good of love and charity and the truth of"

This is evident from the signification of “to prophesy,” as being to teach (see above, n. 624); here both to teach and to be taught, for this is said of “the two witnesses,” which signify the good of love and charity and the truth of doctrine and faith, for these with man are what teach and what also are taught; for those who are in the goods of love and in the truths of doctrine teach, and the goods of love and the truths of doctrine are what are taught by them. It is evident also from the signification of “a thousand two hundred and sixty days,” as being even to the end of the old church and the beginning of the new, for “a thousand two hundred and sixty days” have a similar signification as “three and a half,” since a thousand two hundred and sixty days make three years and a half, computing three hundred and sixty days to the year, and “three and a half” signifies the end of a former state and the beginning of a new one, here the end of the former church and the beginning of the new one, for this refers here to the last time of the church. Because this is the signification of this number, it is said in the ninth verse of this chapter: They shall see their bodies three days and a half, and shall not suffer them to be placed in sepulchers; and afterwards in the eleventh verse: And after three days and a half the spirit of life from God entered into them. In these passages “three days and a half” signify the end of the old church, when no good of love or truth of doctrine whatever will be received; and also the beginning of a new church when they will be received.

The same number of days has a like signification in the next chapter of Revelation: And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared by God, that there they may nourish her a thousand two hundred and sixty days (Rev. 12:6). The “woman” here means the church; the “wilderness,” where she should be nourished, signifies where there is no reception of good and truth; and “after the passing of those days” signifies a new state of the church. 637a. Clothed in sackcloth, signifies in mourning because of the nonreception of Divine good and Divine truth. This is evident from the signification of “clothed in sackcloth,” as being mourning because of the vastation and desolation of Divine good and Divine truth, here because of their nonreception; for the witnesses were seen clothed in sackcloth, and they signify the Divine good, from which is every good of love and charity, and the Divine truth, from which is every truth of doctrine and faith; these appear to be in mourning when they are not received, but in joy when they are received.

[3] In ancient times, when the externals of the church consisted of mere correspondences and thence of representatives of things spiritual, mourning was represented by many things that are significative; as by sitting and lying on the ground, rolling themselves in the dust, by putting ashes on the head, rending the garments, and putting on sackcloth. “Rending the garments and putting on sackcloth” signified mourning because of the desolation of truth and good in the church, and because of the nonreception of them; for “garments” in general signified the truths of the church (see above, n. 64, 65, 195, 271, 395, 475a, 476); therefore “rending the garments” signified grief because the truths of the church are hurt and as it were rent asunder by falsities; and “to be clothed in sackcloth” signifies mourning because of the deprivation of good and truth, and the consequent vastation of the church. [4] For this reason: When Hezekiah the king heard the words of Tartan the captain of the king of Assyria, he rent his clothes and covered himself with sackcloth, and came to the house of Jehovah; and he sent Eliakim who was over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah (2 Kings 19:1, 2; Isa. 37:1, 2). This was done because the “king of Assyria” here signifies the perverted rational, or the rational that perverts the truths and goods of the church and destroys them by falsities; all the words of Tartan the captain of the king of Assyria, involve such things; and because the desolation and vastation of the church was seen to be imminent, to exhibit mourning and grief on this account they rent their garments and covered themselves with sackcloth.

This has a similar signification as above, namely, the imminent desolation and devastation of the church; for this reason the king rent his garments and had sackcloth upon his flesh, which was a representative sign of mourning and grief. [6] Mourning for like reasons is signified also by the following: Jacob, when he believed that Joseph was torn to pieces, rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days (Gen. 37:34). So when Ahab, by the advice of Jezebel his wife, had taken away the vineyard of Naboth, and had heard the hard words of the prophet respecting that matter, he rent his clothes and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, yea, he lay in sackcloth, and went softly (1 Kings 21:27). The king of Nineveh also, when he heard the words of Jonah, arose up from his throne, and laid his robe from him and covered him with sackcloth, and sat upon ashes, and proclaimed a fast, and that man and beast should be covered with sackcloth (Jonah 3:5, 6, 8). So also Daniel set his face to the Lord God, to seek by supplication and prayer in fasting, sackcloth, and ashes (Dan. 9:3). When Abner was slain, David said to Joab and to all the people that were with him, that they should rend their clothes and gird them with sackcloth, and mourn before Abner; and David himself walked behind the bier (2 Sam. 3:31). This makes clear that in the Jewish and Israelitish church mourning was represented by “rending the clothes and being clothed in sackcloth”; and this because grief of mind and mourning of heart, which were interior things, were represented at that time by external things, which because of their correspondences with spiritual things were significative."

[7] That the representation of mourning by sackcloth signified especially mourning because of the desolation of truth and vastation of good in the church, and also, in particular, repentance, with mourning of heart on account of evils, can be seen further from the following passages. In Isaiah: In that day will the Lord Jehovih of hosts call to weeping and to lamenting, and to baldness, and to girding on sackcloth (Isa. 22:12). This chapter treats of the vastation of the church in respect to Divine truth; its mourning is described by “baldness” and by “putting on sackcloth.” [8] In Jeremiah: The lion is gone up from the thicket, and the destroyer of nations journeyeth; he hath gone forth out of his place to make the land a waste; thy cities shall be destroyed, that there shall be no inhabitant; for this gird ye with sackcloth, lament, howl (Jer. 4:7, 8). “The lion from the thicket” signifies the falsity of evil destroying the truths of the church; and “the destroyer of nations” signifies the evil of falsity destroying the good of the church; the “land that they will make a waste” signifies the church, and the “cities that shall be destroyed” signify the truths of doctrine; “to gird with sackcloth” signifies mourning on this account, therefore it is added “lament and howl.” [9] In the same: O daughter of My people, gird thee with sackcloth and roll thee in ashes; make thee mourning for an only one, a lamentation of bitterness, for the waster shall suddenly come upon us (Jer. 6:26). “Daughter of the people” means the church; “to gird herself with sackcloth and roll herself in ashes” signifies mourning because of the destruction of the good and truth of the church; the destruction of these or the vastation of the church is meant by “the waster shall suddenly come.” Evidently grievous mourning and grief because of"

This is said of Tyre, which signifies the church in respect to the knowledges of truth and good, and therefore also the knowledges of truth and good which belong to the church; here mourning on account of the destruction of these is described. “Shipmasters” signify all who bring and communicate these knowledges; “to make bald” signifies mourning on account of the destruction of all things of intelligence; “to gird with sackcloth” signifies mourning because the ability to know truth is also destroyed.

And in David: Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing, thou hast loosed my sackcloth and hast girded me with joy (Ps. 30:11). In these passages, too, “sackcloth” signifies mourning; and “to gird sackcloth over the body instead of the vesture” signifies mourning because of the destruction of the truth of the church; and “to gird sackcloth upon the loins and upon the flesh” signifies mourning because of the destruction of the good of the church; for “the vesture” signifies the truth of the church, and “loins and flesh” signify the good of the church. [19] That “girding with sackcloth” was merely representative and thus significative of mourning and repentance, but was not in itself mourning and repentance, is evident in Isaiah: Is such the fast that I shall choose, the day for a man to afflict his soul, to bow down his head as a rush, and to lie down in sackcloth and ashes; wilt thou call this a fast, and the day of Jehovah’s good pleasure? Is not this the fast that I choose, to loose the bonds of wickedness, to break thy bread to the hungry, and to bring the afflicted exiles to the home, and when thou seest the naked that thou cover him?

Verse 4. These are the two olive trees and the two lamp stands, signifies the good of love to the Lord and of charity towards the neighbor, and the truth of doctrine and of faith from which are heaven and the church. This is evident from the signification of an “olive yard,” “olive tree,” and “olive,” as being, in a broad sense, the Lord’s celestial kingdom and thus the celestial church; which is distinguished from other churches in this, that those from whom that church exists are in love to the Lord and in love towards the neighbor. This is why “olive tree” and “olive” signify each of these loves, that is, the good of each love. (That “olive tree” and “olive” signify that church, or those goods of the church, will be seen in what follows.) This is evident also from the signification of a “lamp stand,” as being in a broad sense the Lord’s spiritual kingdom, and thus the spiritual church, and as the chief thing of that church is truth of doctrine and truth of faith, so these also are signified by the “lamp stands.” (That this is the meaning of a “lamp stand” in the spiritual sense, see above, n. 62.) [2] It is said that “the two witnesses are the two olive trees and the two lamp stands” (which yet are four), because “two” signifies conjunction and thence a one. For there are two things that make a one, namely, good and truth; good is not good except it be from truth, and truth is not truth except it be from good; consequently it is only when these two make a one that they have being and existence. This conjunction into one is called the heavenly marriage, and heaven and the church are from that marriage. It is similar with the celestial good, which is signified by “the two olive trees,” and with the spiritual good, which is signified by “the two lamp stands.” For the good in the Lord’s celestial kingdom is the good of love to the Lord, and the truth of that good is called the good of love towards a brother and companion; while the good in the Lord’s spiritual kingdom is the good of charity towards the neighbor, and the truth of that good is called the good of faith. But a just idea of these things can scarcely be had unless it is known what celestial good is, and what spiritual good is, and what the"

This makes clear why it is that “the two witnesses” are called “two olive trees and two lamp stands.” (That “two” signifies conjunction into one, or the heavenly marriage, see above, n. 532, at the end.) [3] An “olive tree” signifies the celestial church, because “trees” in general signify perceptions and knowledges, and every church is a church from the knowledges of truth and good, and according to their perception; and “oil” signifies the good of love (see above, n. 375a, d, e); so an “olive yard” and “olive tree” signify the church in which that good reigns. There are three trees that especially signify the church, namely, the “olive tree,” the “vine,” and the “fig tree,” the “olive tree” signifying the celestial church, “the vine” the spiritual church, and the “fig tree” the external, celestial and spiritual church. [4] That such is the signification of “the two olive trees and the two lamp stands” anyone can see and conclude from this, that they are called “witnesses,” and thus are what bear witness of the Lord, that is, acknowledge and confess Him; also from what is said of them in what follows, that “the beast killed them,” and afterwards that “the spirit of life from God entered into them,” which could not be said of olive trees and lamp stands, unless these signified such things as are from the Lord with the angels of heaven and with the men of the church, and bear witness of the Lord, that is, cause angels and men to bear witness of Him. For angels and men cannot from themselves bear witness of the Lord, but the good and truth that are with them from the Lord do this, that is, the Lord Himself from His good and truth with them. [5] In many passages in the Word gardens and forests, also olive yards and vineyards and also trees of many kinds, as the olive tree, the vine, the fig tree, the cedar, the poplar, and the oak are mentioned; but no one has known heretofore that each of these signifies something spiritual belonging to heaven and the church, except that a “vineyard” signifies the church; but not only does a “vineyard” signify the church but also an “olive yard,” and a “forest of cedar” or “Lebanon,” and even trees, such as the “olive tree,” the"

[6] In respect to gardens and forests: “gardens or paradises” signify in particular the intelligence and wisdom which the men of the church have; and “forests or groves” signify the intelligence of the natural man, which regarded in itself is knowledge serviceable to the intelligence of the spiritual man; but an “olive yard” and “vineyard” signify the church, “olive yard” the celestial church, or the church that is in the good of love to the Lord, and “vineyard” the spiritual church, or the church that is in the good of charity towards the neighbor, and thence in the truths of faith. The “olive” and “vine” have a like signification; and this because “oil” signifies the good of love to the Lord, and “wine” the good of charity towards the neighbor and the good of faith; while a “fig tree” signifies the church both celestial and spiritual, but external. These things have these significations from representatives in the spiritual world, and thus from correspondence; for in the inmost heaven, where the Lord’s celestial kingdom is, and where love to the Lord reigns, the paradises and forests consist of olive yards and fig trees; but in the second heaven they consist of vineyards and many kinds of fruit bearing trees; in like manner in the lowest heaven, but with the difference that in this heaven the trees are not so noble. Such things exist in the heavens, because they correspond to the wisdom, intelligence, love, charity, and faith of the angels who are in those heavens. From this it can now be seen why “the witnesses” are called “olive trees,” namely, because “olive trees” mean all who constitute the Lord’s celestial church, that is, who are in the good of love to the Lord, and in the good of love towards a brother and companion. 638b. [7] That such is the signification in the Word of “olive yards,” “olive trees,” and “olives,” can be seen from the following passages.

This treats of the foundation of the house or temple by Zerubbabel; and the “house” or “temple” signifies the church, therefore a “lamp stand” was seen by the prophet, and “near it two olive trees,” almost the same as what was seen by John here in Revelation; and the “two olive trees” and “olive berries” signify celestial goods, which are the goods of love to the Lord and of love towards a brother and companion; the former good is signified by “the olive tree seen at the right side of the bowl,” and the latter by “the olive tree seen near the left side.” The truths of this good are meant by “the sons of the olive tree standing by the Lord of the whole earth,” “to stand by Him” signifying to be and to exist from Him. [8] Because these goods are signified by “olive trees”: The cherubim in the midst of the house or temple were made of olive wood, likewise the doors to the adytum, and the door posts (1 Kings 6:23–33). For the “cherubim,” as well as the doors and posts to the adytum of the temple, signified the guard that there be no approach to the Lord except through the good of love; the “adytum” signified where the Lord is, and “olive wood” the good of love, because “the olive yard,” “the olive tree,” and “the olive” signify the celestial things that are of love. [9] Because “the olive yard” and “the olive tree” signified a church that is in love to the Lord: The oil of holiness with which all the holy things of the church were anointed was made of olive oil and spices mixed with it (Exod. 30:23, 24). For all things of the church are holy Divine things just so far as they are derived from love to the Lord; therefore by means of that oil a representation of the Lord and of heaven and the church was established.

That “light” or the “lamp stand” there signified the Lord’s spiritual church, and the “fire” kindled in the lamps signified spiritual love, which is love towards the neighbor; the “pure olive oil beaten” from which was the fire has a similar signification (respecting which see Arcana Coelestia on that passage). [11] That “olive tree” and “olive” signify the good of love is evident also from the following passages. In Hosea: I will be as the dew unto Israel; he shall blossom as the lily, and he shall infix his roots as Lebanon; his branches shall spread; and his honor shall be as that of the olive, and his odor as that of Lebanon (Hos. 14:5, 6). This is said of the spiritual church, which is signified by “Israel”; “to be to him as the dew” signifies the existence and spiritual new birth of that church; the first state of its new birth or regeneration is signified by “he shall blossom as the lily,” “lily” signifying the blossoming that precedes the fruit; the second state of regeneration is signified by “he shall infix his roots,” which state is its existence in the natural, for there the roots are fixed; the third state is signified by “his branches shall spread,” which signifies the multiplication of knowledges and of cognitions; the fifth8 state, which is the state of fruit bearing, is signified by “his honor shall be as that of the olive,” the “olive” signifying the good of love, of which “honor” is predicated (that “honor” is predicated of the good of love, see above, n. 288, 345); and the sixth9 state, which is the state of intelligence and wisdom, is signified by “his odor as that of Lebanon,” “odor” signifying perception, and “Lebanon” rationality, from which are intelligence and wisdom.

[13] In the same: Thy wife shall be as the fruitful vine on the sides of thy house; thy sons like olive plants around thy tables; thus shall the man be blessed that feareth Jehovah (Ps. 128:3, 4). In the natural sense, which is the sense of the letter, this refers to a wife and sons, and the enjoyments arising from marriage and prolification, but in the internal sense, which is the sense of the spirit of the Word, “wife” signifies the affec tion of truth, and “sons” the truths themselves springing therefrom; for every truth in which there is life is born from the affection of truth; and because a “wife” signifies that affection she is compared to a fruitful vine, since a “vine” signifies the church, and a “fruitful vine” the church in respect to the affection of truth. A “house” signifies the spiritual mind, and its “sides” signify all things in the natural man; “sons” signify the truths that are born from that spiritual affection, and these are compared to “olive plants,” because through truths the goods of love and charity, which are olive trees, are brought forth; “around the tables” signifies the enjoyments arising from spiritual appropriation and nourishment. [14] In Moses: It shall be when Jehovah thy God hath brought thee into the land, He shall give thee great and good cities which thou buildedst not, and houses full of every good thing which thou filledst not, and cisterns hewn out which thou hewedst not, vineyards and olive yards which thou plantedst not (Deut. 6:10, 11). The meaning of these words in the spiritual sense is altogether different from their meaning in the historical sense; for in the spiritual sense “the land of Canaan,” into which they were to be brought, signifies the church; therefore “cities,” “houses,” “cisterns,” “vineyards,” and “olive yards” signify such things as"

[15] It is related of Noah: That he sent forth a dove out of the ark, which returned to him about the time of evening, bearing in its mouth the leaf of an olive plucked off, so that he knew that the waters were abated (Gen. 8:10, 11). This describes in the spiritual sense the regeneration of the man of the church, signified by “Noah and his sons”; here the “dove” sent out a second time signifies the second successive state, which is the state when, falsities having been removed, spiritual good begins to spring forth through truths; for a “leaf” signifies truth, and “olive” the good springing forth therefrom, and “waters” signify falsities. (This may be seen more fully explained in Arcana Coelestia, n. 870–892.) 638c. [16] In Zechariah: His feet shall stand in that day upon the Mount of Olives, which is before the faces of Jerusalem on the east; and the Mount of Olives shall be cloven asunder, a part thereof toward the east and toward the sea with a valley exceeding great, and a part of the mountain shall withdraw toward the north, and a part of it toward the south (Zech. 14:4). What this signifies has been explained above (n. 405d), where it was shown that “the Mount of Olives” signifies the Divine love. For the Mount of Olives was on the east of Jerusalem, and “Jerusalem” signifies the church in respect to doctrine; and every church and every truth of doctrine is illuminated and receives light from the Lord in the east; and the east in heaven is where the Lord appears as a sun; and as the “sun” signifies the Divine love, so the “east” and “the Mount of Olives,” which was on the east of"

Because that mountain, as has been said, signified the Lord’s Divine love, the Lord was accustomed to stay on it, as in the Gospels: That Jesus every day was teaching in the temple, and every night He went out and lodged in the mount that is called the Mount of Olives (Luke 21:37; 22:39; John 8:1); That upon that mountain He spoke with His disciples about the last judgment (Matt. 24:3, et seq.; Mark 13:3, et seq.); And that He went therefrom to Jerusalem and suffered; besides many other things (Matt. 21:1; 26:30; Mark 11:1; 14:26; Luke 19:29, 37; 21:37; 22:39; John 8:1). All these things took place because “the Mount of Olives” signified the Divine love; and things significative, because they were representative of heaven and the church, were what at that time conjoined the Lord with heaven and the world. Moreover, the angels of the inmost or third heaven dwell in the east upon mountains, where olive trees abound more than all other trees. [17] In Jeremiah: Jehovah called thy name a green olive tree, beautiful with fruit of form; at the voice of a great tumult He hath kindled a fire upon it, and they have broken its branches; for Jehovah of Hosts, who planted thee, hath spoken evil against thee, because of the wickedness of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah (Jer. 11:16, 17). Here the house of Judah and Israel is called “a green olive tree, beautiful with fruit of form,” because “the olive tree” and its “fruit” signify the good of love, and “green” and “beautiful in form” signify the truth of that good, from which comes intelligence; for “the house of Judah” signifies the church in respect to the good of love, and “the house of Israel” the church in respect to the truth of that good; “to call its name” signifies its quality; the destruction and vastation of that church by the love of evil is described by “Jehovah hath kindled a fire upon it, and hath broken its"

This is attributed to Jehovah because of the appearance that all evil of punishment10 seems to be from God, because He is omnipotent and does not avert it; for it is not known that to avert the evil of punishment would be contrary to order, for if it were averted evil would increase until there would be no good remaining. [18] In Isaiah: So shall it be in the midst of the land, in the midst of the peoples, as the beating of an olive tree, as the gleanings when the vintage is done (Isa. 24:13). This, too, is said of the vastation of the church in respect to celestial good, and in respect to spiritual good; celestial good is the good of love to the Lord, and spiritual good is in its essence truth from that good; celestial good is signified by the “olive tree,” and spiritual good which is the truth from celestial good is signified by the “vintage”; vastation is signified by the “beating” and “gleanings” after the consummation. [19] In Moses: Thou shalt plant vineyards and cultivate them, but the wine thou shalt not drink, for the worm shall devour it; thou shalt have olive trees in all thy border, but thou shalt not anoint thee with the oil, because thy olive shall be shaken off (Deut. 28:39, 40). A “vineyard” signifies the spiritual church, and an “olive tree” the celestial church, so a “vineyard” signifies also the truth of the church, and an “olive tree” its good; therefore “to plant a vineyard and cultivate it and not drink the wine” signifies that although the church is established and truths of doctrine are taught, still truths will neither affect nor perfect, “wine” signifying the truth of doctrine; “for the worm shall devour it” signifies that falsities will destroy; “thou shalt have olive trees in all thy border” signifies that there will be the goods of love from the Lord through the Word and preachings from the Word throughout the church; “not to"

This has reference to the curse if they should worship other gods, and should not keep the statutes and judgments. [20] In Micah: Thou shalt tread the olive but shalt not anoint thee with oil, and the new wine but thou shalt not drink wine (Mic. 6:15). In Amos: I have smitten with blasting and mildew your many gardens and your vineyards; and the palmerworm hath devoured your fig trees and your olive trees; yet have ye not returned unto Me (Amos 4:9). “Gardens” signify such things as belong to spiritual intelligence; “blasting and mildew” signify evil and falsity in what is most external, or from the corporeal-sensual; “vineyards” signify the spiritual or interior truths of the church; “fig trees” exterior goods and truths, which are also called moral; but “olive trees” the goods of the church; and the “palmerworm” signifies falsity destroying good. [21] In Habakkuk: The fig tree shall not blossom, neither shall there be produce on the vines, the labor of the olive yard shall dissemble, and the field shall yield no food (Hab. 3:17). Here, too, the “fig tree” signifies the externals of the church, “vines” its internals; the “olive yard” its goods; and the “field” the church itself with man.

The right of the king is here treated of, by which is meant and described the dominion of the natural man over the spiritual, namely, that it will destroy all the truths and goods of the church, and make them serve the natural man, and thus evils and falsities. [23] In the book of Judges: Jotham said unto the citizens of Shechem, who had made Abimelech king, The trees went forth to anoint a king over them, and they said unto the olive tree, Reign thou over us. But the olive tree said unto them, Shall I make my fatness to cease, which God and men honor in me, and go to move myself over the trees? And the trees said to the fig tree, Come thou, reign over us. But the fig tree said unto them, Shall I make my sweetness to cease, and my good produce; and go to move myself over the trees? And the trees said unto the vine, Come thou, reign over us. But the vine said unto them, Shall I cause my new wine to cease, that maketh glad God and men, and go to move myself over the trees? And all the trees said unto the thorn bush, Come thou, reign over us. And the thorn bush said unto the trees, If in truth ye anoint me for a king over you, come and put your trust in my shadow, but if not, let anger11 go out from the thorn bush and devour the cedars of Lebanon (Judg. 9:7–15). These words of Jotham signify that the citizens of Shechem were not willing to have celestial good, which is the “olive tree,” nor the truth of that good, which is the “vine,” nor moral good, that is, external celestial and spiritual good, which is the “fig tree,” to reign over them, but the evil of falsity, which appeared to them as good, which is the “thorn bush”; the fire from this is the evil of lust; the “cedars of Lebanon” are things rational which are from truths. From the passages quoted above it can be seen that in most places the olive tree and the vineyard are mentioned together, which is done because of the marriage of good and truth in every particular of the Word; for “olive tree” and “oil” signify the good of the church, and “vineyard” and “wine” the truth of that good. (That “oil” signifies the good of love, and the delight of heaven therefrom, may be seen above, n. 375; and that “wine” signifies the good of charity and truth of faith, n. 376.)"

That the Lord is the God of heaven and earth He Himself teaches in Matthew: Jesus said, All power hath been given unto Me in heaven and on earth (Matt. 28:18). The above is evident also from the signification of “standing before Him,” as meaning the being [esse] from Him, and thus what is His in heaven and in the church. [2] In the Word it is here and there said of angels and of the men of the church that “they stand before God,” also that “they walk before Him,” and in the spiritual sense “to stand before God” signifies being from Him, and “to walk before God” signifies to live according to being from Him; for all the being of heaven and the world proceeds from the Lord; for it is the Divine proceeding that has created and formed all things of heaven and the world; this Divine proceeding is called “the Word” in John 1:1–3; and “the Word” there is the Divine proceeding, which is called Divine truth, from which all things were made and created. Because this extends itself in every direction about the Lord as a sun, it is properly said “to stand before Him,” for it looks to the Lord as its common center, from every quarter and from every boundary. This is, in its essence, the Lord in heaven, for it is the Divine proceeding, and that which proceeds is of Him from whom it proceeds, and indeed is Himself; just as the heat and light that proceed from the sun are of the sun.

Verse 5. And if anyone will hurt them, signifies protection of these by the Lord, that they be not hurt in any way. This is evident from what follows; for it is said, “if anyone will hurt them, fire shall go forth out of their mouth and shall devour their enemies”; also “if anyone will hurt them, thus must he be killed.” From these words and those that further follow it is evident that “if anyone will hurt them” signifies protection by the Lord that they be not hurt in any way. This is said of “the two witnesses,” which signify the doctrine of the good of love to the Lord and of the good of charity towards the neighbor, which is the doctrine of life, which the doctrine of faith is to serve; and these doctrines will be preached at the time of the end of the church.

This is done that the good may be separated from the evil; there is a separation because the interior things of the Word, of the church, and of worship, which are celestial and spiritual, are received by the good, but are rejected by the evil. Moreover, the interior things of the Word, which are revealed at the end of the church, are serviceable for doctrine and life to the new church that is also then established. That this is so is evident from this, that when the end of the Jewish church was at hand the Lord Himself opened and taught the interior things of the Word, and especially revealed those things in the Word that had been foretold of Himself; and when these had been opened and revealed the externals of the church were abrogated, which consisted chiefly of sacrifices and rituals and statutes which shadowed forth the Lord, and represented and thence signified the interior things of the church which He was revealing. That this would be done was predicted in various passages in the prophets. [3] The like has been done at the present time; for it has now pleased the Lord to reveal many arcana of heaven, especially the internal or spiritual sense of the Word, which has heretofore been wholly unknown, and with that He has taught the genuine truths of doctrine. This revelation is meant by “the coming of the Lord” in Matthew 24:3, 30, 37. A revelation is necessary at the end of the church in order, as has been said, that by means of it the good may become separated from the evil, and a new church established, and this not only in the natural world where men are, but also in the spiritual world where spirits and angels are; for in both worlds there is a church, and revelation takes place in both, and thereby separation, as also the establishment of a new church. From this it can be seen that these words signify protection by the Lord that they be not hurt. [4] As regards the successive states of the churches on our globe, they have evidently been similar to the successive states of a man who is being reformed and regenerated, namely, that to become a spiritual man, he is first conceived, next is born, then grows up,"

The church, from the most ancient times to the end of the Jewish church, progressed like a man who is conceived, born, and grows up, and is then instructed and taught; but the successive states of the church after the end of the Jewish church, or from the time of the Lord even to the present day, have been like a man increasing in intelligence and wisdom, or becoming regenerate. For this end the interior things of the Word, of the church, and of worship, were revealed by the Lord when He was in the world; and now again, things still more interior are revealed; and in the measure that things interior are revealed can man become wiser; for to become interior is to become wiser, and to become wiser is to become interior. 642. Fire shall go forth out of their mouth and shall devour their enemies, signifies that those who would do them harm fall into evils and falsities which are from hell, and these destroy them. This is evident from the signification of “fire,” as being love in both senses, here the love of self and of the world, and thus the love of evil and falsity of every kind (of which above, n. 68, 504, 539). From this it follows that “fire shall go forth out of their mouth” signifies that those who desire to hurt them or do them harm fall into evils and falsities of every kind, which are from hell. Also from the signification of “devouring their enemies,” as being that such will be destroyed by the falsities of evil; for “enemies” in the Word signify the falsities of evil, and “adversaries” evils, and the love of evil and falsity is what destroys. [2] It is said that “fire shall go forth out of their mouth”; but this is said according to appearance, and it is according to this that it is also said that “fire and a flame go forth out of the mouth of God,” and that “anger and wrath go forth from His nostril,” and yet nothing of the fire of anger and wrath goes forth from Him, for He is good itself, love itself, and mercy itself, from which nothing of fire, of anger, or of wrath, can go forth, yet it is so said, because it so appears. It so appears, because when an evil and infernal spirit assails anything Divine with intent of hurting it, as when he blasphemes the Lord or the Word, or any good and truth of"

From this it can be seen that the Lord does no evil to such, but that the evil spirit himself brings evil upon himself, that is, the evil itself which is in him does it. [3] This makes clear the meaning of the words, “If anyone desires to hurt the two witnesses, fire shall go forth out of their mouth and shall devour them”; the two witnesses are the good of love and charity, and the truth of doctrine and faith; and these are Divine, because they are from the Lord with angel and man; the meaning is, not that fire will go forth from these, but from the evil itself, which endeavors to do them harm, as has just been said; and that this is to be understood in a similar way as when it was said that fire, anger, and wrath go forth from Jehovah. (But these things are more fully set forth in the work Heaven and Hell, n. 545–550, under the head, the Lord casts no one down into hell, but the spirit casts himself down.) 643. And if anyone will hurt them, thus must he be killed, signifies that according to their endeavor to inflict evil they perish. This is evident from the signification of “will hurt,” as being the endeavor to inflict evil, for to will is to endeavor; also from the signification of “to be killed,” as being to perish, here in respect to spiritual life, which is destroyed solely by the evils and the falsities of evil, for such are the cause of spiritual death (see above, n. 315, 589). It is here again said “If any will hurt them,” because it is meant that everyone perishes according to his wish or endeavor to inflict evil, for it is the will that makes the life of everyone. Everyone perishes according to his wish to hurt “the two witnesses,” who are the “two olive trees and the two lamp stands,” that is, the good of"

Moreover, every man and spirit is under the Lord’s protection, the evil as well as the good; and to him who is under the Lord’s protection no evil can happen —for it is the Lord’s will that no one should perish or be punished. But so far as anyone is under the Lord’s protection he abstains from doing evil, but so far as he does not abstain he removes himself from the Lord’s protection, and so far as he so removes himself he is hurt by the evil spirits who are from hell; for infernal spirits have an unceasing desire to do evil to others; and so far as any are outside of the Lord’s Divine protection, that is, so far as they do evil, they come into the power of those who do evil to them by inflicting punishment and depriving them of such things as belong to spiritual life. In a word, so far as anyone desires to hurt the goods of love and the truths of doctrine he is “devoured by fire and is killed,” that is, he is possessed by evils and the falsities of evil, and so far he spiritually dies, and this comes to pass not from the Divine but from the evil itself that he does. 644a. Verse 6. These have power to shut heaven that it rain no rain in the days of their prophecy, signifies that those who reject the goods and truths of heaven and the church that proceed from the Lord, receive no influx out of heaven. This is evident from the signification of “shutting heaven,” as being lest any influx out of heaven be received (of which presently); also from the signification of “rain,” as being truth fertilizing, which is truth from which there is good that flows down out of heaven (of which also presently); also from the signification of “their prophecy,” as being prediction respecting the Lord and His coming, and respecting the good of love to Him and the truths of faith in Him. This revelation and the proclamation of this revelation at the end of the church is what is chiefly meant by “the days of the prophecy of the two witnesses.” It is the Lord that is chiefly proclaimed at the end of the church by “the two witnesses,” because “the two witnesses,” which are the"

For it is well known that every good of love and every truth of faith flows in out of heaven, that is, from the Lord through heaven, with man, and that it flows in continually; from which it follows that neither the good of love nor the truth of faith is in anywise man’s, but is the Lord’s with him. These both flow insofar as evil and falsity do not obstruct; it is these that shut heaven so that there is no influx; for evil and good, and falsity and truth, are opposites, consequently where the one is the other cannot be; for evil with man prevents the entrance of good, and falsity the entrance of truth; while good causes evil to be removed, and truth falsity; for these are opposites, as heaven and hell are opposites; therefore the one acts against the other with an unceasing endeavor to destroy, and the one that prevails destroys the other. [3] Moreover, there are in every man two minds, an interior which is called the spiritual mind, and another, the exterior which is called the natural mind. The spiritual mind is created for the reception of light from heaven, but the natural mind for the reception of light from the world. The spiritual mind, therefore, which is man’s interior mind, is heaven with him, and the natural mind, which is man’s exterior mind, is the world with him. The interior mind, which is heaven with man, is opened so far as man acknowledges the Divine of the Lord, and man so far acknowledges this as he is in the good of love and charity and in the truths of doctrine and faith. But this interior mind, which is heaven with man, is unopened so far as man does not acknowledge the Divine of the Lord, and does not live the life of love and faith; and that mind is shut so far as man is in evils and in falsities therefrom; and when it is shut then the natural mind with man becomes a hell; for in the natural mind are evil and its falsity, consequently when the"

This is said of “the two witnesses,” as was said above that “fire shall go forth out of their mouth and shall devour their enemies,” and yet no fire goes forth from them and devours (as has been said in the two articles above). “That it rain no rain” signifies no influx of Divine truth out of heaven, because “water,” which makes rain, signifies the truth of the Word, and the truth of doctrine and faith therefrom (see above, n. 71, 483, 518, 537, 538); and as rain water descends out of the clouds in heaven, so “to rain rain” signifies the influx of Divine truth from the Lord in heaven, and as rain fertilizes the earth, so “rain” signifies Divine truth fertilizing and making fruitful the church, for which reason “rain” signifies also spiritual blessing. 644b. [5] That “rain” in the Word does not mean rain, but the inflowing Divine, which causes intelligence and wisdom, and also the good of love and the truth of faith in man, to grow and become fruitful, and that “to rain” signifies influx can be seen from the following passages. In Moses: My doctrine shall flow down as the rain, My word shall distill as the dew, as the drops on the grass, and as the showers on the herb (Deut. 32:2). Doctrine is here compared to rain, because “rain” signifies the Divine truth proceeding, from which is everything of doctrine; for all comparisons in the Word are also from correspondences. Because “rain” signifies the Divine truth flowing down it is said, “My doctrine shall flow down as the rain.” “Dew” signifies good, and since “word” has the same signification, therefore it is said, “My word shall distill as the dew.” So intelligence and wisdom therefrom are signified by “the drops on the grass,” and by “the showers on the herbs,” for as the grass and herb of the field grow from the waters of the rain and dew, so do intelligence and wisdom"

This is first said by Moses, because in this chapter he is speaking of the twelve tribes of Israel, which signify in the spiritual sense all truths and goods of the church, and thus doctrine in the whole complex. [6] In the same: The land which ye shall pass over to possess it is a land of mountains and valleys, of the rain of heaven it drinketh waters. And I will give the rain of your land in its time, the former rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in thy corn, and thy new wine, and thine oil. But if ye shall serve other gods, and shall not walk in my statutes, the anger of Jehovah shall glow against you; He will shut heaven that there be no rain, and the land shall not yield her produce (Deut. 11:11, 14, 16, 17). This describes the land of Canaan and its fruitfulness; but as that land means in the spiritual sense the church, it follows that all things of this description signify such things as belong to the church, as “mountains,” “valleys,” “corn,” “new wine,” “oil,” “produce,” and “rain.” “A land of mountains and valleys” signifies the higher and lower, or internal and external things of the church; the internal things of the church are with the internal man, which is also called the spiritual man, and the external things of the church are with the external man, which is called the natural man; that both these are such as to receive the influx of Divine truth is signified by “of the rain of heaven it drinketh waters.” That Divine truth inflows in both states, that is, when the man of the church is in his spiritual state and when he is in his natural state, is signified by “the rain given in its time, the former rain and the latter rain”; for the man of the church is by turns in a spiritual state and in a natural state, and the influx and reception of Divine truth in a spiritual state is meant by “the former or morning rain,” and in a natural state by “the latter or evening rain”; spiritual and celestial good and truth which the man of the church has therefrom is meant by the “corn,” “new wine,” and “oil,” which they shall gather in; that the falsities of doctrine and of worship will prevent the influx and reception of Divine truth, and in consequence, the increase of spiritual life, is signified by “if ye shall serve other gods there shall be no rain, and the land will not yield her produce,” “other gods” signifying the falsities of doctrine and of worship."

Here “the rain that shall be given in its time, and the produce of the land,” have a similar signification as above; and as the church was at that time an external church, representative of interior spiritual things, so when they walked in the statutes, and kept the commandments and did them, it came about that they had rain in its time, and the earth yielded its produce, and the tree of the field its fruit; and yet the rain and the produce thence were representative and significative, “rain” represented the Divine flowing in, “the produce,” the truth of doctrine and the understanding of truth, and “the fruit of the tree,” the good of love and the will of good. [8] This can be seen from its being said: That the rain was withheld, and consequently there was a famine in the land of Israel for three years and a half, under Ahab, because they served other gods and killed the prophets (1 Kings 17 and 18; Luke 4:25). This was a representative, and thus a significative, that no Divine truth flowing in out of heaven could be received because of the falsities of evil, which were signified by “other gods” and by “Baal,” whom they worshiped. “Killing the prophets” signified also the destruction of the Divine, for a “prophet” signifies in the Word the doctrine of truth from the Word.

The “vineyard” which is laid waste signifies the church; “it is not pruned nor hoed” signifies no ability to be cultivated and so prepared to receive; “the briar and bramble” which shall come up signify the falsities of evil; “to command the clouds that they rain no rain” signifies that no influx of Divine truth from heaven is received.

Here “the Word” which goeth forth out of the mouth of God is compared to the rain and snow from heaven, because “the Word” means Divine truth proceeding from the Lord, which with us flows in through the Word; “rain and snow coming down out of heaven” have a similar meaning, “rain” signifying spiritual truth, which has been appropriated to man, and “snow” natural truth, which is like snow when it is in the memory only; but it is made spiritual by love, as snow is made rain water by heat. “To irrigate the earth and to make it to bring forth and to bud” signifies to vivify the church that it may bring forth the truth of doctrine and of faith, and the good of love and of charity; the truth of doctrine and of faith is signified by “the seed that it gives to the sower,” and the good of love and of charity by “the bread that it gives to the eater”; “it shall not return to Me empty, but it shall do what I will,” signifies that it shall be received, and that by it man shall be led to look to the Lord.

That the Lord with such flows in with the good of love, and from that good into truths, is signified by “He shall give them the former rain in righteousness”; “righteousness” is predicated in the Word of the good of love, and “the righteous” mean those who are in that good (see above, n. 204a).

[19] In Jeremiah: The Maker of the earth by His power prepareth the world, by His wisdom and by His understanding He stretcheth out the heavens; at the voice that He giveth forth there is a multitude of waters in the heavens; and He maketh the vapors to go up from the end of the earth; He maketh lightnings for the showers, and bringeth forth the wind out of His treasuries (Jer. 10:12, 13; 51:16; Ps. 135:7). “The world which the Maker of the earth prepares by His power” signifies the church in the whole globe, “power” signifying the potency of Divine truth; “the heavens which He stretcheth out by wisdom and understanding” signify the church in the heavens corresponding to the church on earth, “wisdom and understanding” signifying the Divine proceeding, from which angels and men have the wisdom of good and the understanding of truth, and “to stretch out” signifying the formation and extension of the heavens in general, and the extension of understanding and wisdom with everyone who receives; “at the voice that He giveth forth there is a multitude of waters in the heavens” signifies that from the Divine proceeding there are spiritual truths in immeasurable abundance, “voice” signifying the Divine proceeding, “waters” truths, and “multitude” abundance; “He maketh the vapors to go up from the end of the earth” signifies truths in ultimates, such as the truths of the Word are in the sense of the letter, in which are spiritual truths, “the end of the earth” signifying the ultimates of the church, “vapors” truths for those who are in ultimates, and “to make them to go up” meaning to give spiritual truths from ultimates because they are in ultimates, for spiritual truths are what especially make the church fruitful; “He maketh lightning for the showers” signifies enlightenment from"

Ye hypocrites, ye know how to discern the face of the earth and of heaven, how is it that ye do not discern this time? (Luke 12:54–56) By this comparison the Lord teaches that they see earthly things but not heavenly things; and the comparison itself, like all other comparisons in the Word, is derived from correspondences; for “a cloud rising in the west” signifies the Lord’s coming at the end of the church predicted in the Word, “cloud” signifying the Word in the letter, “rising” the Lord’s coming, and the “west” the end of the church; “straightway it is said, There cometh a shower” signifies that then there will be an influx of Divine truth; “and when ye see the south wind blowing” signifies the proclamation of His coming; “it is said, There will be a scorching heat” signifies that then there will be an influx of Divine good. The same words signify also contentions and combats of truth from good with falsities from evil, “shower and scorching heat” signifying also such contentions and combats; for this comparison follows the words of the Lord: That He came not to give peace on the earth, but division, and that the father shall be divided against the son, and the son against the father, the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against the mother (Luke 12:51–53); and these words signify such contention and combat; that “shower” also has this signification may be seen below. Because this comparison, regarded in its spiritual sense, implies the coming of the Lord, and because from blindness induced by falsities they did not acknowledge Him, although they might have known Him from the Word, it therefore follows:"

[21] In Hosea: Let us know, and let us follow on to know Jehovah; His going forth is prepared as the clouds; and He shall come to us as the rain, as the latter rain that irrigateth the earth (Hos. 6:3). This is said of the Lord and His coming; and as all Divine truth proceeds from Him, from which angels and men have life and salvation, it is said “He shall come to us as the rain, as the latter rain that irrigateth the earth,” “to irrigate the earth” signifying to render fertile the church, which is said to be rendered fertile when truths are multiplied and thence intelligence increases, and when goods are made fruitful, and thence celestial love increases. [22] In the second book of Samuel: The rock of Israel spake to me; as the light of morning the sun riseth, of a morning without clouds; from the brightness after rain there is grass out of the earth (2 Sam. 23:3, 4). This is said of the Lord, who from the Divine truth that proceeds from Him is called “the Rock of Israel.” That Divine truth proceeds from His Divine good is meant by “as the light of the morning the sun riseth.” There is a comparison with light because “light” signifies the Divine truth proceeding, and with the morning because “morning” signifies the Divine good, and with the rising sun because “rising” and the “sun” signify the Divine love; that these are without obscurity is signified by “the light of a morning without clouds”; the enlightenment of the man of the church by the reception and after the reception of Divine truth from the Lord’s Divine good is signified by “from the brightness after rain,” “brightness” signifying enlightenment, and “rain” influx and consequent reception. That those who are of the church have therefrom knowledge, intelligence, and wisdom, is signified by “the"

[23] In Matthew: Love your enemies, bless13 them that curse you, bless them that hate you, and pray for them that hurt and persecute you; that ye may be sons of your Father who is in the heavens; who maketh His sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust (Matt. 5:44, 45). Here first charity towards the neighbor, which is to wish good and do good even to enemies, is described by “loving them, blessing them, and praying for them,” for genuine charity regards only the good of another. Here “to love” signifies charity, “to bless” instruction, and “to pray” intercession, and for the reason that inwardly in charity there is the end to do good. That this is the Divine itself with man, such as it is with regenerate men, is signified by “that ye may be sons of your Father in the heavens,” “Father in the heavens” means the Divine proceeding, for all who receive this are called “sons of the Father,” that is, of the Lord; “the sun that He maketh to rise on the evil and on the good” signifies the Divine good flowing in; and “the rain that He sendeth on the just and on the unjust” signifies the Divine truth flowing in; for the Divine proceeding which is “the Father in the heavens,” flows in with the evil equally as with the good, but the reception of it must be on man’s part, yet not on man’s part as from man, but as if from man, for the ability to receive is given to man continually, and it also flows in to the extent that man removes the evils that oppose, and does this also from the ability that is continually given, the ability itself appearing to be man’s, although it is of the Lord. 644d. [24] From this it can now be seen that “rain” signifies in the Word the influx of the Divine truth from the Lord, from which man has spiritual life, and this because “waters,” of which rain consists, signify the truth of doctrine and the truth of faith. But as “waters,” in the contrary sense, signify the falsities of doctrine and"

This is the signification of shower [imber] in Matthew: Everyone that heareth My words and doeth them I will liken to a prudent man who built his house upon a rock; and the shower descended, and the rivers came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house, yet it fell not. But everyone that heareth My words and doeth them not shall be likened unto a foolish man who built his house upon the sand; and the shower descended, and the rivers came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house, and it fell, and great was the fall of it (Matt. 7:24–27). Here “shower” and “rivers” mean temptations, in which man conquers or in which he yields; “waters” mean the falsities that usually inflow in temptations; and “rivers,” which here are inundations of water from a shower, signify temptations; “the winds that blow and beat” signify the thoughts that arise therefrom, for temptations arise through the breaking in of falsities injected by evil spirits into the thoughts. The “house” they beat upon signifies man, strictly his mind, which consists of understanding or thought and of will or affection; he that receives the words of the Lord, that is, Divine truths, in one part of the mind only, which is that of the thought or understanding, and not at the same time in the other part, which is that of the affection or will, yields in temptations, and falls into grievous falsities, which are the falsities of evil; therefore it is said, “great was the fall of it”; but he who receives Divine truths in both parts, that is, both in the understanding and in the will, conquers in temptations. The “rock” upon which that house is founded signifies the Lord as to Divine truth, or Divine truth received by the soul and heart, that is, by faith and love, in other words, by the understanding and will; while the “sand” signifies Divine truth received only in the memory, and somewhat therefrom in the thought, and thus in a scattered and disconnected way, because intermixed with falsities, and falsified by notions. This makes clear what is meant by “hearing the words and not doing them.” That this is the sense of these words can be seen more clearly from what precedes them."

Thus said the Lord Jehovih, I will make a wind of tempest to break through in My wrath, and an overflowing rain in Mine anger, and hailstones in wrath for a consummation, and I will throw down the wall that ye have daubed with what is unfit (Ezek. 13:11, 13, 14). “Daubing with what is unfit” signifies the confirmation of falsity by fallacies, whereby falsity appears as truth; “hailstones” signify truths without good, thus without any spiritual life, which are all inwardly falsities, for ideas that are dead cause them to be merely shells, and like pictures in which there is nothing living; such truths merely known belong to the natural man, into which nothing from the spiritual flows. “The overflowing rain and the wind of tempests” signify falsities rushing in copiously, and things imaginary, and disputes about truths, which make it impossible for anything of truth to be seen, and which thus destroy man.

(But the particulars of the description in these chapters of the flood and of the salvation of the family of Noah, may be seen explained in Arcana Coelestia . That “waters” signify truths, and in the contrary sense, falsities, may be seen above, n. 71, 483, 518, 537, 538; and that “the overflowings of waters” signify the overflowings of falsities and temptations, see also above, n. 518e.) 645. And they have power over the waters to turn them into blood, signifies that truths with such are turned into falsities from evil. This is evident from the signification of “having power” when “the olive trees and lamp stands” are referred to, as signifying the goods of love and the truths of doctrine; not that these themselves have such power, namely, to turn truths into falsities, since this is contrary to their nature, which is to turn falsities into truths, for good acts with them and not evil, and yet they appear to have this power and appear to do this, because this occurs when they are hurt; but it is the evil that is from hell, or hell from which all evil comes, that “turns waters into blood,” that is, truths into falsities from evil. The above is evident also from the signification of “waters,” as being truths (of which above, n. 71, 483, 518, 537, 538); also from the signification of “blood,” as being the truth of the Word, and thence of doctrine from the Word, and in the contrary sense falsity, in particular the truth of the Word falsified, for “to shed blood” signifies to do violence to charity, and also to Divine truth which is in the Word.

[2] That this is done anyone can see and conclude from this, that every good of love and truth of faith is from the Lord, and that those who do not acknowledge and confess the Lord are unable to receive any good of love or truth of faith; for by non- acknowledgment and denial they shut heaven to themselves, that is, they reject all the influx of good and truth from heaven, or through heaven from the Lord; consequently they are in what is their own [suum proprium], which regarded in itself is nothing but evil and falsity therefrom; and for this reason, because they think and will from what is their own [proprium], that is, from self, they are unable to think or to will anything that does not flow forth from the love of self and the love of the world, and from the lusts of those loves, thus are unable to think or will anything whatever that is from love to the Lord or from love towards the neighbor; and those who will and think from the loves of self and of the world and their lusts only are unable to will anything but evils or think anything but falsities.

So long as man lives in the world he does not know that he is raised up above what is his own, because he does not feel it, and yet there is an elevation or as it were a drawing of man’s interior understanding and interior will towards the Lord, and thus a turning of man’s face in respect to his spirit towards the Lord.

[4] But since it is according to Divine order that where there is a drawing there must be an impelling force, for without this there can be no drawing, so it is according to Divine order that there be with man an impelling force; and although this is from the Lord, yet it appears as if it were from man, and the appear ance causes it to be as if it were man’s. This impelling force as if from man, corresponding to the drawing that is from the Lord, is acknowledgment, thus reception from acknowledgment and confession of the Lord and from a life according to His commandments. There must be this on man’s part and from his life’s freedom, and yet man must acknowledge that even this is from the Lord, although from the obscurity of perception in which man is he has no other feeling than that it is as if from himself. These things are said to make known that a man who denies the Lord cannot be in anything but evils and in falsities therefrom, because he cannot be drawn away from what is his own, that is, be elevated above it; neither can he be influenced by any drawing from the Lord, and consequent turning of the interiors of his mind towards the Lord. 647.

In the sense of the letter of the Word it is indeed said of Jehovah God, that is, the Lord, that He is angry, and wrathful, that He is furious against the evil,15 and that He does evil to them, yea, that He wills to do so; and yet the Lord is never angry or wrathful, nor does He will or"

This makes clear that “as often as the witnesses will” does not mean as often as they will, but as often as the evil will, that is, from willing do evil, in other words, assault the goods and truths of heaven and the church that are from the Lord that they may inflict injury upon them. [2] That the Lord, and thus the good of love and the truth of faith that are of the Lord with man and angel, will no evil to anyone can be seen from this, that the Lord God is not the cause of evil with anyone, and he who is not the cause of evil is not the cause of punishment, but the evil itself that is with man is the cause. In the spiritual world where heaven and hell are, all things are so arranged that the Lord never casts anyone down into hell, but the evil spirit casts himself down (see in the work Heaven and Hell, n. 545–550); and this because the Lord is not the cause of evil, and he who is not the cause of evil cannot be the cause of any effect that springs from evil. From this it is clear that the contents of this verse, namely, that the two witnesses “have power to shut heaven that it rain no rain,” and that “they have power over the waters to turn them into blood, and to smite the earth with every plague as often as they will,” are not to be understood according to the sense of the letter, but according to the spiritual sense, which is, that those who do evil to the “two witnesses” bring such things upon themselves; for so far as anyone does evil to them so far he shuts heaven against himself, and turns truths with himself into falsities, and destroys himself by the lusts of evil. 648.

[2] That this is the signification of “testimony,” can be seen from what has been thus far said about “the two witnesses,” namely, that by them the good of love and charity and the truth of doctrine and faith are meant, because these are what especially testify concerning the Lord, for they are from the Lord, and are His with man; therefore “their testimony” signifies preaching concerning these. That “testimony” here signifies the acknowledgment of the Divine in the Lord is evident from what follows in Revelation: That the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy (Rev. 19:10). For unless a man acknowledges this from the heart, and believes it from spiritual faith, he can have no ability to receive the good of love or the truth of doctrine."

For this reason men think of the Lord in the same way as they think of a common man, and from that thought their faith flows, however much they may say with the lips that they believe in His Divine. Let anyone explore, if he can, the idea of his thought about the Lord, whether it be not such. But when it is such man cannot be conjoined to the Lord by faith and love, nor through conjunction receive any good of love or truth of faith. This, then, is why there is at the end of the church no acknowledgment of the Lord, that is, of the Divine in the Lord and from the Lord. It is believed that there is an acknowledgment of the Divine of the Lord, because such is the doctrine of the church; but so long as His Divine is separated from His Human, His Divine is yet not acknowledged interiorly but only exteriorly, and to acknowledge exteriorly is to acknowledge with the mouth only and not with the heart, or in speech only and not in faith. [4] That this is so can be seen from Christians in the other life, where the thoughts of the heart are manifested. When they are permitted to speak from doctrine and from what they have heard from preaching they attribute a Divine to the Lord, and call it their belief; but when their interior thought and faith are explored they have no other idea of the Lord than as of a com mon man who has no Divine. It is man’s interior thought that is the source of his faith; and as such is the thought and consequent faith of man’s spirit, there is plainly no acknowledgment of the Divine in the Lord and from the Lord in the Christian world at the end of the church.

The beast that cometh up out of the abyss shall make war with them, signifies assault from infernal love. This is evident from the signification of “beast,” as being the affection of the natural man in both senses (of which presently); also from the signification of “the abyss,” as being hell (of which above, n. 538); also from the signification of “to make war,” as being to assault, for by “wars,” in the Word, such wars as are in our world are not meant, but such as are in the spiritual world, all of which are combats of falsities from evil against truths from good; that such is the signification of “wars” in the Word will appear in what follows, where wars are again mentioned. From this it can be seen that “the beast that cometh up out of the abyss shall make war with them,” that is, the witnesses, signifies that infernal love from the falsities of evil shall assault the truths of good. [2] It has been shown before that a “beast” signifies a love or affection of the natural man; let something now be said about assault. Infernal love is especially the love of self, for the love of self is the love of what is man’s own, and what is man’s own is nothing but evil; consequently so far as a man is in that love he is against the Lord, and thus against the good of love and charity, and against the truth of doctrine and faith, thus against these “two witnesses”; for this reason, the hells where the love of self reigns are more direful and malignant than others, and are directly opposed to the Lord, and thence unceasingly assault the goods of love and faith, because these are from the Lord alone, and are the Lord with man and angel. That these hells are more direful than the others can be seen from this, that they continually breathe forth the destruction of those who confess the Divine of the Lord, therefore of those who"

[3] These hells are more malignant than the rest because so far as man is in the love of self, and at the same time in the love of self- intelligence, his natural lumen is in a kind of brightness, as it were, for the love of self is like a fire that kindles that lumen; it is from this that men can ingeniously think and reason against the Divine and against all things of heaven and the church. I have sometimes been astonished when I have listened to such, and have thought that they above all others were capable of being led to receive faith, but I perceived that this was impossible, for so far as they were enlightened in corporeal, worldly, and natural things they were in thick darkness in respect to celestial and spiritual things. This thick darkness was seen to be exceedingly dusky, with something fiery intermixed. This I could confirm by much experience, if this were the place for describing experiences. The love of self is what is here meant in particular by “the beast coming up out of the abyss,” which made war with the two witnesses and killed them. [4] That a “beast” signifies the love and affection of the natural man in both senses can be seen from very many passages in the Word; and this has heretofore been unknown, and as it may seem strange that “beasts” should signify the love or affection of the natural man, it is necessary to confirm this from the Word. Natural affections are signified by “beasts” because these affections are altogether similar to the affections of beasts, consequently a man who16 is not imbued with spiritual affections through the goods and truths of heaven differs little from beasts. For man has above the beasts the superadded faculty to think and thence to will spiritually, which gives him the eminent faculty to see and perceive abstract things; but if this spiritual faculty is not vivified by the knowledges of truth and good, and afterwards by faith and the life of faith, he is no better than the beasts, except merely that by virtue of that higher faculty he is able to think and speak.

But such things are only appearances of the affections that are with spirits; and when these are made apparent it is also known there not only that the appearances are from these affections, but also from whom they are; but as soon as the affections with such cease, these appearances also cease. From this it can also be seen why “beasts” are so often mentioned in the Word. [6] But let us proceed to the confirmations from the Word. In David: Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of Thy hands. Thou hast put all things under His feet, the flock and herds, yea, the beasts of the fields, the bird of heaven, and the fishes of the sea (Ps. 8:6–8). This whole psalm treats of the Lord and His dominion over all things of heaven and the church; the things of heaven and the church are meant here and elsewhere in the Word by “the works of the hands of Jehovah”; and as it is over these things that the Lord has dominion, and as spiritual things in the Word are expressed by natural things, for the Word in its bosom is spiritual, so by “flock,” “herds,” “the beasts of the field,” “the birds of heaven,” and “the fishes of the sea,” these are not meant, but the spiritual things of heaven and the church. “Flock and herds” signify spiritual things and natural things that are from a spiritual origin, a “flock,” that is, lambs, kids, she-goats, sheep, and rams, signifying spiritual things, and “herds,” which are bullocks, oxen, cows, and camels, natural things from spiritual things; “beasts of the field” signify the affections of the natural man, “birds of the heavens” thoughts therefrom, and “fishes of the sea,” the knowledges of the sensual- natural man. Except for this meaning, why should the Lord’s dominion over these be described? [7] In the same:"

Here evidently “wild beast” stands for a people that receives the influx of Divine truth from the Lord, for of God’s “inheritance,” which signifies the church, it is said, “Thy wild beast (Thy congregation) shall dwell in it”; “the rain of good will” signifies the influx of Divine truth from Divine clemency. [8] In the same: Jehovah, who sendeth forth springs into the brooks; they run between the mountains, they give drink to every wild beast; the wild asses quench their thirst, by them the bird of the heavens dwells, from among the boughs they give forth their voice; who causeth the grass to spring forth for the beast, and the herb for the service of man, that he may bring forth bread out of the earth.

As in the Hebrew “wild beast” is derived from a word that means life, Eve the wife of Adam had her name from the same word. This is said that it may be known what “wild beast” and “beast” signify in the proper sense. [10] What is signified by “Jehovah sendeth forth springs into the brooks, to run between the mountains, and give drink to every wild beast of the fields, the wild asses quench their thirst, and by them the bird of the heavens dwells,” has been explained above (n. 483a). “Jehovah causeth the grass to spring forth for the beast, and the herb for the service of man, that he may bring forth bread out of the earth,” signifies the instruction and nourishment of the natural and spiritual man by truths from the Word, that he may have thereby the good of love and charity; “grass” signifies the truth of the natural man, which is true knowledge (see above, n. 507); “beast” signifies affection for it which wishes to be instructed and spiritually nourished; “herb” signifies the truth of the spiritual man; “man” signifies intelligence therefrom and “bread” signifies the good of love and charity, which is nourished by truths. As “darkness” and “night” signify the lumen of the natural man, which compared to the light of the spiritual man is like night, “the wild beast of the forest” signifies the affection of knowledges, “the sea great and wide in spaces” the natural itself, “the creeping thing without number” knowledge therein, and “the wild beasts great and small” the various affections, it is evident what is signified by “Thou appointest the darkness that there may be night, in which every wild beast of the forest goeth forth; the sea great and wide in its spaces, wherein is the creeping thing without number, wild beasts the small with the great.” [11] In the same: They shall sow fields and plant vineyards, and make fruit of increase, and He shall bless them so that they may be multiplied exceedingly; and He shall not diminish their beast; yet are they diminished and bowed down because of the vehemence of wickedness and grief (Ps. 107:37–39)."

Who cannot see that the enumeration of such things in the Divine Word would be wholly unmeaning unless they signified something with man that can praise, that is, worship Jehovah? From a knowledge of correspondences it is known that “whales” signify the knowledges of the natural man in general, “deeps” and “seas” the natural itself where the knowledges are, “wild beast” and “beasts,” the affections of the natural man as well those which belong to his understanding as those of his will, “the creeping things” the sensual, which is the ultimate of the natural man, and “birds of wing” the thinking faculty therefrom.

Why else should the Word (which is given solely to teach man the way to heaven, by teaching him the truths of faith and the goods of love), speak of Jehovah as “preparing rain for the earth, making grass to spring forth upon the mountains, giving to the beast his food, and to the sons of the raven which call upon Him”? These things, however, are worthy of the Divine Word, when by “rain” the influx of Divine truth is meant, by “mountains” the good of love, by “making grass to spring forth” the instruction of the natural man by the knowledges from the Word, by “beasts” the affections of the natural man, which desire to be thus nourished. “To give food” signifies nourishment; and since “the sons of the raven” signify natural men who are in an obscure lumen from fallacies respecting Divine truths, as were many of the nations, it is said “He giveth to the sons of the raven which call,” for such can call upon Jehovah, but not the sons of a raven. [14] In the same: Every wild beast of the forest is Mine, the beasts upon a thousand mountains. I know every bird of the mountains, and the wild beast of My fields is with Me (Ps. 50:10, 11). This is said of sacrifices, that the Lord does not delight in them, but in the confession of heart and calling upon Him; yet “the wild beast of the forest,” “the beasts upon the mountains,” and “the bird of the mountains,” and “the wild beast of the fields,” have a similar signification as above, namely, things pertaining to the man of the church. [15] In the same: Thy righteousness is like the mountains of God, Thy judgments are a great deep; O Jehovah, Thou preservest man and beast (Ps. 36:6). “Man and beast” signify interior affection, which is spiritual, from which is intelligence, and exterior affection, which is natural, from which is knowledge corresponding to intelligence."

In Zechariah: The angel who came to measure Jerusalem said, Run, speak, saying, Jerusalem shall inhabit the suburbs, by reason of the multitude of man and of the beast in the midst of it (Zech. 2:3, 4). Let your hands be strong, for the temple shall be built; for before those days there was no price for man nor any price for beast, for to him that went out and to him that came in there was no peace from the enemy (Zech. 8:9, 10). 17] In these passages “man and beast”17 signifies what is interior or spiritual, and “beast” what is exterior or natural; and therefore “man” signifies the spiritual affection of truth, from which is all intelligence, and “beast” the natural affection corre sponding to the spiritual. What is exterior or natural is signified by “beast,” because man, in respect to his external or natural man is nothing but a beast; for he enjoys like desires and also pleasures, appetites and senses, so that in these respects man is entirely similar to the beast; therefore the natural man may be called the animal man. But what is internal or spiritual is signified by “man,” because it is in respect to his internal or spiritual that man is man; this enjoys the affections of good and truth such as are with the angels of heaven, also because by means of this with him man rules his natural or animal man, which is a beast. 650c.

And God made the wild beast of the earth according to its kind, and the beast according to its kind, and everything that creepeth upon the ground according to its kind. And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness; and they shall have dominion over the fishes of the sea, and over the bird of the heavens, and over the beast, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. And there was evening and there was morning, the third18 day (Gen. 1:24–31). In the spiritual sense of this chapter, by “the creation of heaven and earth” the new creation or regeneration of the man of the most ancient church is described; for this reason “beast” here signifies the external or natural man, and “man” the internal spiritual, and “dominion over the beasts” here means the dominion of the spiritual man over the natural. [19] That it was granted to the man of that church to know all the affections of the natural man, in order that he might have dominion over them, is signified by these words in Genesis: Out of the ground Jehovah God formed every beast of the field, and every bird of the heavens, and brought unto the man, to see what he would call it; and whatsoever man called it, the living soul, that was its name; and the man called the names to every beast, and to the bird of the heavens, and to every wild beast of the field (Gen. 2:19, 20). “To call the name” signifies in the spiritual sense to know the quality of a thing, or what it is, so here to know the qualities of all the affections, desires, pleasures, appetites, also the thoughts and inclinations of the natural man, and how they agree and correspond to the affections and perceptions of the spiritual man. For it was granted to the spiritual man from creation to see all things of the natural man, and at the same time to perceive its agreement or disagreement with the spiritual, in order that he might rule the natural and accept such things as agree and reject those that disagree, and thus might become spiritual even as to"

[20] Because “man” in the Word signifies properly the internal or spiritual man, and “beast” the external or natural man, by command of God all beasts and birds were brought into the ark with Noah; of which it is thus written in Genesis: Jehovah said to Noah, Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee seven and seven, male and female; and of the beast that is not clean two, male and female. And he took of the beast that was clean, and of the beast not clean, and of the bird, and of everything that creepeth upon the earth; two and two entered unto Noah into the ark, male and female (Gen. 7:1–9). “Noah’s flood” describes in the spiritual sense the destruction of the most ancient church, and also the last judgment upon the men of that church; and by “Noah and his sons” in the same sense, the church that followed is meant and described, which is called the ancient church. From this it follows that the “beasts” brought into the ark with Noah mean the affections of the natural man, corresponding to spiritual affection, which the men of that church had (but these things may be seen explained in Arcana Coelestia). [21] Since “man” signifies the internal spiritual man, and “beast” signifies the external or natural, and “Egypt” signifies the natural man separated from the spiritual, which has altogether perished and is no longer a man but a beast, so where the destruction of Egypt is treated of it is related that: Jehovah made hail to rain with which fire was mingled, and smote everything that was in the fields, from man even to beast (Exod. 9:22–25). (See respecting this also in Arcana Coelestia.) For the purpose of representing and thus signifying the same thing it is also written that: Jehovah smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from man even to beast (Exod. 12:12, 29)."

Because such things were represented and thus signified by “man and beast,” from a holy rite received in the ancient church: The king of Nineveh proclaimed a fast, and commanded that neither man nor beast should taste or drink anything, and that man and beast should be covered with sackcloth (Jonah 3:7, 8). 650d. [22] Because “beasts” signify the affections in both senses it was forbidden to make the figure of any beast; of which it is thus written in Moses: Ye shall not make to you the figure of any beast that is on the earth, the figure of any winged bird that flieth under heaven, the figure of anything that creepeth on the ground, the figure of any fish that is in the waters under the earth (Deut. 4:17, 18). This was because the posterity of Jacob, who were called, because of the representation of the church with them, “the sons of Israel,” were in externals without an internal, that is, were for the most part merely natural; if, therefore, they had made to themselves the figure of any beast or bird, which signified the affections and the like, they would have made idols for themselves, and would have worshiped them. This, too, was why the Egyptians, who had more knowledge of representatives than any other people, made for themselves figures of beasts, as of calves, serpents, and many other kinds; yet at first not with reference to worship, but on account of their signification; but their posterity, who from internal became external, and thus merely natural, did not look upon these as representative and significative, but as holy things of the church, and thus they offered to them idolatrous worship. It was for this reason that the posterity of Jacob, who were altogether external men, and thence in heart idolatrous, were forbidden to make to themselves any figure of these things."

Because all kinds of beasts signify the various things pertaining to the men of the church, laws were enacted respecting beasts, which ones might be eaten and which might not be eaten (Lev. 11). Those that might be eaten signified goods, and those that might not be eaten signified evils; for the church at that time was a representative church, and therefore every particular prescribed for them was representative and significative, especially the beasts; of this we thus read in Moses: Ye shall distinguish between the clean beast and the unclean, and between the unclean bird and the clean, that ye may not make your souls abominable by beast or by bird; and ye shall be holy unto Me (Lev. 20:25, 26). 25] From this it can now be seen why sacrifices of beasts of various kinds were permitted, as of lambs, sheep, kids, goats, bullocks, oxen, also of pigeons and turtledoves; namely, because they signified things spiritual, and things natural from a spiritual origin; as “lambs” innocence, “sheep” charity, “bullocks and oxen” the affections of the natural man corresponding to the affections of the spiritual man. It was on this account that the beasts for the sacrifices varied according to the reasons for which they were offered; this would not have been unless each particular sacrifice of beasts had signified something belonging to the church.

[34 ] In Hosea: In that day will I make a covenant for them with the wild beast of the field and with the bird of the heavens and with the creeping thing of the earth, and I will break the bow and the sword and the war from the earth, and I will make them to lie down securely; and I will betroth thee to Me forever (Hos. 2:18, 19). This is said of the establishment of a new church by the Lord, which is here treated of. Evidently Jehovah, that is, the Lord, will then make a covenant, not with the wild beast of the field, the bird of the heavens, and the creeping thing of the earth, but with the men in whom the church will be established. These things, therefore, signify such things as are with man, namely, the “wild beast of the field” the affection of the knowledges of truth, the “bird of the heavens” rational thought from what is spiritual, the"

That He will then “break the bow and the sword from the earth” signifies that He will destroy the falsities that fight against the truths of doctrine; and that there will be no longer any contention between truths and falsities and goods and evils is signified by “I will betroth thee to Me forever.” [35] In Isaiah: The wild beast of the field shall honor Me, the dragons and the daughters of the owl; because I will give waters in the wilderness and rivers in the desert, to give drink to My people, My chosen (Isa. 43:20). Evidently “the wild beast of the field,” “the dragons,” and “the daughters of the owl,” do not mean here a wild beast of the field, dragons and owls, for these cannot honor Jehovah. That the men of the church are meant is clear from what follows, since it is said, “to give drink to My people, My chosen.” “The wild beast of the field” signifies therefore the affections of the knowledges of truth, “dragons” natural ideas, and “daughters of the owl” sensual affections; for the sensual is affected by truths and sees them in the darkness as owls see objects at night. [36] This being the signification, it is evident that the Gentiles with whom a new church was to be established are meant, for before they were reformed these were in such obscure affection and natural thought. “To give waters in the wilderness and rivers in the desert” signifies to imbue with truths and thence with intelligence those who before were in ignorance, “waters” meaning truths, “rivers” intelligence, and “wilderness and desert” ignorance; “to give drink to the people of Jehovah and to His chosen” signifies to instruct those who are in the truths of faith and in the good of charity; those who are in the truths of faith are called “people,” and those who are in the good of charity are called “chosen.” [37] In Joel: Is not the food cut off before our eyes from the house of our God, gladness and joy?

This describes the state of the church when there are no longer in it any truths of doctrine or good of life. “The food cut off from the house of God” signifies spiritual nourishment, which is from truths that are from good, “the house of God” signifying the church; “the beast groaneth, the droves of cattle are perplexed” signifies the lack of the affections of truth and thence of knowledges in the natural man, and grief on that account, “droves of cattle” signifying the things of the natural man in the whole complex. [38] That there is “no pasture” signifies no instruction; “the droves of the flock are made desolate” signifies the lack of spiritual truth and good which are of faith and charity; “the beast of the field panteth after thee” signifies the grief of those who are in natural affection, and consequently in a longing for the knowledges of truth and good; “the channels of waters are dried up” signifies the truths of doctrine dissipated by natural love; “fire hath devoured the habitations of the wilderness” signifies that love and thence the destruction of the knowledges of truth, “the habitations of the wilderness” meaning the things of the understanding and the will in such a man, which would otherwise receive the truths and goods of the church.

This is said of the establishment of the church by the Lord; and the “earth which will fear, but rejoice and be glad” signifies the church and its delight; its establishment by the Lord is signified by “Jehovah hath done great things”; therefore “the beasts of His fields” mean those who are in the affections of good and long for"

Because “beasts of the fields,” “tree,” “fig tree,” and “vine,” signify such things as are with the man of the church it is said, “Sons of Zion, rejoice and be glad in Jehovah,” “sons of Zion” meaning those who are of the celestial church, while “to rejoice” is predicated of the delight of good; and “to be glad” of the pleasantness of truth. [41] In Ezekiel: In that day Gog shall come upon the land of Israel; and then shall be a great earthquake upon the land of Israel; and the fishes of the sea, and the bird of the heavens, and the wild beast of the field, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man who is upon the faces of the earth, shall tremble before Me (Ezek. 38:18–20). “Gog” signifies external holiness without internal holiness, thus those who are in such holiness; an “earthquake” signifies a change of the state of the church; “the fishes of the sea, and the bird of the heavens, the wild beast of the field, the creeping thing of the earth, and every man, shall tremble” signifies that all things of man, in respect to what belongs to the church with him, shall be changed; “the fishes of the sea” meaning the knowledges, “the birds of the heavens” thoughts therefrom, “the wild beasts of the field” the affections therefrom, “the creeping thing of the earth” the thoughts and affections in the corporeal-sensual, and “man” all these from"

This describes the last state of the old church, and the beginning of the new. The last state of the old church is described by “a great tumult, when Judah shall fight against Jerusalem,” which means the change at that time, and the fight of the love of evil against the truths of the doctrine of the church; “the plague of the horse, of the mule, of the camel, of the ass, and of every beast” signify such things as hurt and destroy the church and the spiritual life of the men of the church, “horses, mules, camels, and asses” signifying the things of their understanding and of their will, thus the things of their knowledges and affections. But what is signified in particular by “horse, mule, camel, and ass,” has been told elsewhere; here it is stated merely that “beast” signifies the affection of the natural man, and “the plague of beast” the hurting and destroying of that affection. [43] In Jeremiah: How long shall the land mourn, and the herb of every field dry up? For the wickedness of them that rule20 therein the beasts and the bird shall be consumed (Jer. 12:4). The “land” means the church; “the herb of the field” signifies the truth of the church that has sprung up and that is springing up; “to mourn and to dry up” signifies to perish and to be dissipated by lusts; “the beasts and the bird that shall be consumed” signify the affections of good and the thoughts of truth therefrom.

This is said of “the land shadowed with wings,” by which the church is meant which, because of the obscurity it is in, catches at imaginary things for spiritual truths, and thus from ignorance comes into a denial of these truths. “Bird and beast” signify here the thoughts of truth and the affections of good, both rational and natural, which are said “to loathe and despise.” Evidently it is not the bird and every beast that will loathe and despise, but the affections of good and the thoughts of truth, that is, those who are in these.

This is said of the calling together of the Gentiles to the church, and the reception by them of the truth of doctrine in the good of love, which is the good of life, and of their consequent intelligence in spiritual things. Therefore “the bird of every wing and every wild beast of the field” which shall be gathered from every side to the great sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel, mean all in whatever state they may be in respect to the perception of truth and the affection of good, “the bird of every wing” meaning all in whatever kind of perception of truth they may be, and “every wild beast of the field” all in whatever kind of affection of good they may be; “to gather together from every side” signifies those outside the church from every quarter. [47] “The great sacrifice” signifies the worship of the Lord from faith and love, for that is what “sacrifices” in general represented; and “the mountains of Israel” signify the goods of spiritual love. “To eat flesh and drink blood” signifies to appropriate to oneself the good of love and the truth of that good; “to eat the flesh of the mighty and drink the blood of the princes of the earth” signifies such appropriation, “the mighty” (or oxen) signifying the affections of the natural man, and “the princes of the earth” the chief truths of the church; “rams, lambs, kids, bullocks, fatlings of Bashan” signify all things of innocence, love, charity, and good, “the fatlings of Bashan” meaning the goods of the natural man from a spiritual origin. [48] From this it is clear what is signified by “eating flesh to satiety, and drinking blood to drunkenness,” namely, to be filled with every good of love and truth of faith; “to be satiated at the table of the Lord with horse and chariot, with the mighty, and with every man of war” signifies to be fully instructed from the Word, “horse” signifying the understanding of truth, “chariot” the doctrine of truth, “the mighty and the man of war” the truth of good fighting against the falsity of evil, and destroying it.

[49] That such is the signification of “bird of every wing and beast of the field” can be seen from passages before explained, also from these words in Isaiah: The saying of the Lord Jehovih, who gathereth the outcasts of Israel, I will yet gather them to his gathered ones; every wild beast of My fields, come ye to devour, every wild beast in the forest (Isa. 56:8, 9). “The outcasts of Israel,” whom the Lord will gather, signify all in the church who are in truths from good separated from those therein who are in falsities from evil; these are meant also by “the wild beasts of the fields of the Lord Jehovih,” “fields” signifying the church in reference to the implantation of the truth of doctrine; but the Gentiles that are without the church are signified by “the wild beast in the forest,” the “forest” signifying the natural and sensual man, and “the wild beast” its knowledge and obscure intelligence therefrom. This evidently is the signification of “the wild beast of the field” and “the wild beast in the forest,” for it is said, “Come ye to devour, every wild beast of My fields and every wild beast in the forest,” “to devour” signifying instruction and appropriation. 650f. [50] As most things in the Word have also a contrary sense, so also have “beast” and “wild beast,” in which sense “beasts” signify evil affections, which are the cupidities of adulterating and destroying the goods of the church, and “wild beasts” the cupidities of falsifying and thus destroying the truths of the church. [51] In this sense “beasts” and “wild beasts” are mentioned in the following passages. In Ezekiel: I will raise up over them one shepherd, who shall feed them, My servant David; he shall be to them for a shepherd; then I will make with them a covenant of peace, and will cause the evil wild beast to cease out of the land, that they may dwell trustingly in the wilderness and sleep in the forest; they shall be no more a prey to the nations, and the wild"

This is said of the Lord’s coming and of the blessed state of heaven and of those of the church who will come into the new heaven. “The servant David, the shepherd whom Jehovah will raise up,” means the Lord, who is called a “servant” from serving and ministering, that is, performing uses (see above, n. 409b); “to make with them a covenant of peace” signifies conjunction with the Lord through the Divine things proceeding from Him, which are the goods of love and the truths of doctrine from the Word, thus through the Word; “to cause the evil wild beast to cease out of the land” signifies that evil cupidities and lusts will no more invade and destroy them. [52] “To dwell trustingly in the wilderness and to sleep in the forests” signifies that they will be safe from infestation by cupidities and lusts, although they are in them and among them, “wilderness” and “forest” meaning where such things and such persons are (these having a similar meaning as in Isa. 11:7–9). Because the man of the church is destroyed by the cupidities of evil and falsity it is said “they shall no more be a prey to the nations, and the evil wild beast shall not devour them,” “nations” signifying the cupidities of evil, and “wild beasts of the earth” the cupidities of falsity.

This is said of the vastation of the church by the falsities of evil. “Heritage” signifies the church; “the lion out of the forest which hath given forth his voice against God” signifies the falsity of evil in the whole complex; “the bird Zabuah” signifies reasonings from falsities; “the wild beast of the field which shall be gathered to devour” signifies the cupidities of destroying the truths of the church by falsities; and because the church that is so destroyed is"

[54] In Isaiah: No lion shall be there, the ravenous of the wild beast shall not go up thereon, it shall not be found there (Isa. 35:9). This treats of the Lord’s coming and of His kingdom in the heavens and on the earths; and the “lion” and “the ravenous of the wild beasts” have a similar signification as above. It must be clear to everyone that “wild beast” here does not mean a wild beast. [55] In Hosea: I will encounter them as a bear that is bereaved, and I will rend the caul of their heart, and I will devour them like a huge lion; the wild beast of the field shall tear them (Hos. 13:8). Here again, “lion” and “the wild beast of the field” have a similar signification as above.

How is she become a waste, a place for the wild beast to lie down in; everyone that passeth over her hisseth and moveth his hand (Zeph. 2:13–15).

[57] The “chapiters in which these shall rest” signify the knowledges of truth from the Word falsified; “the voice in the window” signifies the proclamation of falsity; “the drought in the threshold” signifies the total desolation of truth; the “cedar which is made bare” signifies the rational destroyed; “the rejoicing city dwelling securely” signifies the doctrine of falsity, with which they are delighted and in which they rest; “saying in her heart, I and none other besides me” signifies the pride of self-intelligence; “the place for the wild beast to lie down in” signifies the state of the church vastated in respect to truths; “everyone that passeth over her hisseth and moveth his hand” signifies contempt for such and rejection of them by those who are in truths and goods of doctrine. [58] In Moses: I will give peace in the land, so that ye may lie down securely and none make afraid, and I will cause the evil wild beast to cease out of the land, and the sword shall not pass through your land (Lev. 26:6). “Peace in the land, so that they may lie down securely and none make afraid” signifies protection by trust in the Lord from the breaking in of falsity into the church; “to cause the evil wild beast to cease out of the land” signifies freedom from the affection and cupidity of falsity; and “the sword shall not pass through the land” signifies that falsity shall no longer destroy truth.

[60] There is a like signification in these words in Moses: Jehovah God will drive out these nations from before thee by little and little; thou canst not destroy them at once, lest the wild beast of the field be multiplied against thee (Deut. 7:22). The “nations” driven out and to be driven out of the land of Canaan by the sons of Israel signify evils and falsities of every kind, “the land of Canaan” signifying the church, and “the sons of Israel” the men of the church; therefore “the wild beast of the field” which would be multiplied against them signify the cupidities of falsity from evil; for a man who is reformed and regenerated to the extent that the church may be in him is reformed and regenerated by little and little; for he is conceived anew, is born, and is educated, and this is done so far as the evils and their falsities that are in him from birth and hereditarily are removed, which is not effected in a moment, but through a considerable course of life.

In the same: I will give him to the wild beast to be devoured (Ezek. 33:27). The sheep were scattered, without a shepherd, and were for food for every wild beast of the field (Ezek. 34:5, 8). I have given thee for food to the wild beast of the land and to the bird of the heavens (Ezek. 29:5).

In Jeremiah: I will visit upon them with four kinds, with the sword to kill, and with dogs to drag about, and with birds of the heavens and with the beasts of the earth to devour and to destroy (Jer. 15:3). 62] In these passages, “wild beasts and birds” signify falsities from the cupidity of evil and from reasoning. And as the “nations” in the land of Canaan signify the evils and falsities of religion and of worship, the sons of Jacob did not bury the dead bodies of the nations which they slew in war, but left them to be devoured by birds and wild beasts; but this was not by Divine command, but from the inborn cruelty of that people, thus by permission, in order that such things might be represented.

The “violence of Lebanon” signifies the violence done to the truths perceived by the rational man from the Word, for “Lebanon” signifies the church in respect to the perception of truth from the rational man; “the devastation of the beasts” which shall dismay them signifies the destruction of truths by the cupidities of evil; “bloods” signify the violence offered to the truths of the Word by evils; and “violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein” signifies violence done to the truths and goods of the church and to its doctrine from the Word by falsities.

This is what takes place when the natural man separated from the spiritual looks upon things holy; this is why these are called the “idols of the house of Israel.” “The wall round about” upon which they were seen painted signifies the interiors everywhere in the natural man, for the “roof” signifies the inmost, the “floor” or “pavement” the outmost, the “walls” the interiors, and the “house” the man himself in respect to the things of his mind. The natural man is interior and exterior, and the interior natural is where the filthy things of man reside and these the exterior does not divulge but puts on the semblance of things good, just, and sincere. [67] As “wild beasts” and “beasts” signify the goods of the understanding and the goods of the will which are of the affections, and as the ancients who knew correspondences made representative and significative figures of these, which at first they did not worship, but their posterity, who from internal became merely external, worshiped them as divine in themselves, so wild beasts and beasts became idols. This is evident in Isaiah: Bel bowed down, Nebo stooped, their idols are to the wild beast and to the beast (Isa. 46:1). In Isaiah there is a prophecy respecting: The beasts of the south (Isa. 30:6, et seq.);"

[69] Nearly the like things are signified in Revelation by: The beast coming up out of the sea (Rev. 13:1–10); The beast coming up out of the earth (Rev. 13:11–18); The scarlet beast (Rev. 17:3); The beast out of the abyss (Rev. 17:8). (Respecting these beasts more is said in Rev. 19:19, 20, and 20:10.) But what cupidities of evil and falsity each beast signifies will be seen below, where these beasts are treated of.

The Lord’s being in the wilderness forty days represented the duration of all those most direful temptations which He, above all others in the whole world, endured and withstood; for “forty days” signify the entire period and duration of temptations, thus not that He was tempted at that time only, but from childhood even to the end of His life in the world; His last temptation was in Gethsemane. For by temptations He subjugated all the hells and also glorified His Human (but respecting the Lord’s temptations see the New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine, n. 302). Because temptations arise through evil spirits and genii who are from hell, thus through the hells, from which evils and falsities and their cupidities and lusts arise, so the “beasts” here, with which the Lord was, do not mean beasts, but the hells and the evils that rise out of them; and the “angels” who ministered unto Him do not mean angels, but Divine truths, through which from His own power He overcame and subjugated the hells. (That “angels” signify in the Word Divine truth, see above, n. 130, 200, 302, 593.) 651. And shall overcome them and kill them, signifies the consequent destruction of every good and truth of the church. This is evident from the signification of “to overcome and kill the two witnesses,” as being to destroy the things signified by “the two witnesses,” which are the good of love and charity and the truth of doctrine and faith. That these will be destroyed by the affections of the natural man separated from the affections of the spiritual man, which are evil cupidities of every kind arising from infernal loves, is signified by “the beast that cometh up out of the abyss”; and that it was foretold that this would come to pass at the end of the church, when the last judgment takes place, has been said above. “To kill” signifies in the Word to kill spiritually, which means here to destroy the good of love and the truth of doctrine, as may be seen above (n. 315). 652a.

In like manner the Lord is said “to have been slain” and “to be dead,” to signify that the Divine proceeding from Him, which is Divine good and Divine truth, has been rejected, that is, the Lord has been slain and is dead with those by whom that has been rejected (see above, n. 83). This is evident also from the signification of “the street of the great city,” as being the truth and good of doctrine, and in the contrary sense the falsity and evil of doctrine; for “street” signifies truth leading, and in the contrary sense falsity leading (of which presently); and “city” signifies doctrine (of which above, n. 223). It is said “great city,” because “great” is predicated of good, and in the contrary sense of evil, as “many” is predicated of truth, and in the contrary sense of falsity (see above, n. 223b, c, 336a, 337). This now makes clear that “the bodies of the two witnesses upon the street of the great city” signifies the extinction of the good of love and charity and of the truth of doctrine and faith by the falsities and evils of doctrine. As the evils and falsities of doctrine are signified, it is next said “which great city is spiritually called Sodom and Egypt,” “Sodom” signifying the evils of the love, and “Egypt” the falsities therefrom, each pertaining to doctrine, by which the church at its end is destroyed (concerning which in the following articles). [2] “Street” signifies the truth of doctrine, and in the contrary sense the falsity of doctrine, because in the spiritual sense a “way” signifies truth leading to good, and in the contrary sense falsity leading to evil (see above, n. 97); and streets are ways in a city, and as a “city” signifies doctrine, so a “street” signifies the truth and the falsity of doctrine. Moreover, in the spiritual world there are cities, and streets in them, as in the cities of the world; and what each one is in respect to the affection of truth and intelligence therefrom is known there merely from the place where he dwells and from the streets in which he walks.

But in the cities where those live who are in the persuasion of falsity from evil the reverse is true. This makes clear why it is that a “street” signifies truth or falsity leading. 652b. [3] That “streets” have this signification can be seen from the following passages. In Jeremiah: Run ye to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see, I pray, and know, and seek in the open places thereof if ye can find a man that doeth judgment, that seeketh truth; then will I pardon her (Jer. 5:1). Because “the streets of Jerusalem and the open places thereof” signify the truths of doctrine, according to the states of affection and perception of those who are of the church, and because “Jerusalem” signifies the church in respect to doctrine it is said, “Run ye to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see and know, and seek in the open places thereof”; and because “judgment” is predicated of truths, since all judgment comes from laws and precepts, which are truths, and because “truth” signifies the truth of doctrine and of faith it is said, “if ye can find a man that doeth judgment and that seeketh truth.” The “open places” mean particularly the corners of the city, thus the quarters where the dwelling places are; and as each one in the cities in the spiritual world has his dwelling place in accordance with his affection of good and his perception of truth, clear or obscure, therefore “open places” signify truths and goods according to each one’s affection and perception.

Because “street” signifies where truth leads, it is said “truth hath stumbled in the street.” [5] In Nahum: The chariots raged in the street, they ran to and fro in the open places (Nah. 2:4). Because “chariots” signify the doctrinals of truth, and “streets” and “open places” what is in accord with each one’s affection and perception, as above, it is said “the chariots raged in the streets, they ran to and fro in the open places,” “to rage” signifying to call falsities truths, and “to run to and fro” signifying to wander off. [6] In the book of Judges: In the days of Jael the ways ceased, they that go in footpaths went in crooked paths, they ceased, the open places ceased in Israel (Judg. 5:6, 7). This is in the Song of Deborah and Barak, which treats of the desolation of truth in the church, and afterwards of its restoration; the desolation is described by “the ways ceased, they that go in footpaths went in crooked paths, they ceased, the open places ceased in Israel”; “ways and paths” having the same signification as “streets and open places,” namely, truths of doctrine leading, and “to go in crooked ways” signifies to wander away from truths."

Here, too, “streets” signify the truths of doctrine leading to the good of life, or truths according to which one must live. This treats of the church where the Word is, and its devastation in respect to truths; therefore “they that did eat delicacies are laid waste in the streets” signifies that those who have imbibed genuine truths from the Word have no longer any truths, “delicacies” meaning genuine truths from the Word; “they that were brought up in crimson have embraced dunghills” signifies that those who had imbibed genuine goods from the Word have nothing but the falsities of evil, “crimson” signifying the genuine good of the Word, in particular the celestial love of truth, and “dunghills” signifying the falsities of evil; “the form of the Nazirites is darker than blackness, they are not recognized in the streets,” signifies that Divine truth is in such obscurity that it is apparent to no one; “the Nazirites” represent the Lord in relation to Divine truth, and therefore signify Divine truth from the Lord; “they have wandered about blind in the streets, they are polluted with blood,” signifies that the truths of the Word are no longer seen because they have been falsified, “the blind” signifying those who do not see truths. “They have hunted our steps, so that we cannot go in the streets,” signifies leading astray, so that it is not known how to live, “to hunt the steps” signifying to"

This makes evident what is signified by: The Lord’s commanding the seventy whom He sent out to preach the Gospel, Into whatever city ye enter and they receive you not, go out into the streets thereof and say, Even the dust of your city that cleaveth unto us do we shake off from us24 (Luke 10:10, 11). 30] Because “the streets of a city” signify the truths of doctrine, according to which one should live, it was customary to teach and to pray in the streets. Thus in the second book of Samuel: Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Ashkelon, lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice (2 Sam. 1:20)."

And when thou prayest thou shalt not be as the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets where they may be seen of men (Matt. 6:2, 5). And in Luke: Then shall ye begin to say, We did eat before Thee and drink, and Thou didst teach in our streets; but He shall say, I tell you I know you not whence ye are (Luke 13:26, 27). 31] Furthermore, from the signification of “street,” as meaning the truth of doctrine, it is also evident why the Lord said in the parable that: The master of the house commanded his servants to go out quickly into the streets and open places of the city and bring in the poor, the maimed, the lame, and the blind (Luke 14:21). “The poor, the maimed, the lame, and the blind,” do not mean such in a natural sense, but such in a spiritual sense, that is, such as had not the Word, and were therefore in ignorance of truth and in lack of good, but still desired truths by means of which they might obtain good; such were the Gentiles with whom the church of the Lord was afterwards established. [32] Because “the street of a city” signified either truth or falsity teaching and leading, therefore: The angels that came to Sodom said that they would lodge all night in the street (Gen. 19:2). And for the same reason it was commanded that: If the sons of Israel observed that those in any city served other gods they should smite the inhabitants of the city with the sword, utterly destroying the city, and they should bring all the spoil of it into"

[33] From these passages cited from the Word it can be seen what is signified by “the bodies of the two witnesses were cast forth upon the street of the great city which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt,” and afterwards that “they were not suffered to be placed in sepulchers”; for it was a custom with the Jewish and Israelitish nation to cast out the slain that were enemies into the ways and streets, and not to bury them, as a sign of their hatred of such; but still this represented that by such enemies infernal evils and falsities that could not be raised again to life were meant, that is, those who were in infernal evils and falsities. [34] This is evident in Jeremiah: The prophets prophesy, saying, Sword and famine shall not be in this land; by sword and by famine shall these prophets be consumed, and the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out into the streets of Jerusalem, and there shall be no one to bury them (Jer. 14:15, 16). A “prophet” means the doctrine of truth, here the doctrine of falsity, because they prophesied falsities; and as “streets” signified where falsities are, it is said that “they were to be cast out into the streets of Jerusalem.” 653a. Which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, signifies through the evils of the love of self and the falsities therefrom. This is evident from the signification of “Sodom,” as being the love of self and evils of every kind therefrom (of which presently); also from the signification of “Egypt,” as being the natural man separated from the spiritual, and falsity of evil of every kind therefrom (of which also presently).

[2] First let it be shown here that “Sodom” signifies in the Word the love of self, and thence every evil; for evils of every kind flow forth from the love of self; since he who loves himself only loves what is his own, and therefore immerses all things of his will and his understanding in what is his own, even so that it is impossible for him to be elevated from it to heaven and to the Lord; consequently he sees nothing from the light of heaven, but solely from the light of the world, which light, separated from the light of heaven, is mere darkness in spiritual things, which are the things of heaven and the church; and for this reason also the more a man loves himself the more he despises, yea, denies spiritual things. In consequence also of this the internal spiritual mind, by which man is in the light of heaven, is closed up, and this causes the man to be merely natural, and the merely natural man is inclined to evils of every kind. For the evils into which man is born have their seat in the natural man, and these are removed from him only to the extent in which his interior mind, which receives the light of heaven, is opened; moreover, what is man’s own has its seat in the natural man, and what is man’s own is nothing but evil. [3] That “Sodom” therefore signifies the love of self, and thus evils of every kind, can be seen from the passages in the Word where “Sodom” is mentioned; as in the following. In Ezekiel: Thy elder sister is Samaria, she and her daughters dwelling at thy left hand; but thy younger sister, dwelling at thy right hand, is Sodom and her daughters; thou hast corrupted thyself more than they in all thy ways; Sodom thy sister hath not done, she and her daughters, as thou hast done and thy daughters. Behold, this was the iniquity of Sodom, pride, satiety of bread, and tranquillity of quiet was hers and her daughters, and she strengthened not the hand of the afflicted and needy; therefore they became lofty, and committed abomination before Me (Ezek. 16:46–50)."

For there are two kingdoms into which heaven and thence the church is divided, the spiritual kingdom and the celestial kingdom (respecting these kingdoms see in the work Heaven and Hell, n. 20–28). These kingdoms were represented by the Israelites whose metropolis was Samaria, and by the Jews whose metropolis was Jerusalem. [4] Spiritual good, which is the good of charity toward the neighbor, is the opposite of infernal evil, which is the evil of the love of the world; and celestial good is the opposite of diabolical evil, which is the evil of the love of self. From the love of self flow forth evils of all kinds, and much worse than those from love of the world (see the New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine, n. 65–83). This is why more direful and abominable things are related of Jerusalem than of Samaria; and this is why Jerusalem is not only called “Sodom,” but it is said that she did worse things than Sodom, as it is here said “Sodom hath not done as thou hast done and thy daughters.” That the evil of the love of self was the evil of Sodom, is thus declared, “This was the iniquity of Sodom, pride, satiety of bread, tranquillity of quiet, and she strengthened not the hand of the afflicted and needy,” “pride” meaning the love of self, “satiety of bread,” the contempt of all good and truth of heaven and the church, even to loathing of them, “tranquillity of quiet,” security and no anxiety on account of any evil; and “not strengthening the hands of the afflicted and needy” signifies unmercifulness. Because the love of self was the love of Sodom it is said that her daughters “became lofty and committed abomination before Jehovah,” the “daughters” that became lofty signifying the cupidities of that love, and the “abomination before Jehovah” signifying every evil against the Divine Itself."

In Jeremiah: A sword against the Chaldeans, and against the inhabitants of Babylon, according to God’s overthrowing Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighboring cities thereof, not a man shall dwell there, nor shall a son of man sojourn therein (Jer. 50:35, 40). And in Isaiah: So shall Babylon, the ornament of kingdoms, the splendor of the magnificence of the Chaldeans, be as God’s overthrowing Sodom and Gomorrah (Isa. 13:19). “Sodom” signifies the evil of the love of self, and “Gomorrah” the falsity of that love; and as the love of self does not acknowledge any truth of the church, it is said, “not a man shall dwell there, nor shall a son of man sojourn therein,” “man” signifying intelligence, and “son of man,” the truth of the church. [6] Because “Edom” signifies the natural man, who is in falsities from the love of self, and therefore adulterates the goods of the church, her vastation is compared to the overthrowing of Sodom and Gomorrah.

In Isaiah: Jerusalem hath stumbled, and Judah hath fallen; the hardening of their faces doth witness against them, and their sin is as Sodom’s (Isa. 3:8, 9). Hear the word of Jehovah, ye princes of Sodom; give ear to the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah (Isa. 1:10). “The Word of Jehovah” means Divine good, and “the law of God” Divine truth, for where good is treated of the name “Jehovah” is used, but where truth is treated of the name “God” is used; and as Divine good, to those who are in the love of self, is evil, it is said “their sin is as Sodom’s,” and “hear the Word of Jehovah, ye princes of Sodom”; and as Divine truth to those who are in the evil of the love of self is falsity, it is said, “give ear to the law of God, ye people of Gomorrah.” [8] In Moses: Their vine is of the vine of Sodom, and their grapes are of the field of Gomorrah, grapes of gall, their clusters are of bitterness (Deut. 32:32). This is said of the direful falsities that exist with the posterity of Jacob, springing from the evils of the love of self. But this is explained above (n. 519b ).

What is signified by “eating delicacies,” “brought up in crimson,” “laid waste in the streets,” and “embracing dunghills,” has been explained in the article above (n. 652b). It is said that their iniquity “is become greater than the sin of Sodom,” because they had the Word, from which they could know the truths and goods of heaven and the church, or of doctrine and life, and adulterated them, and this the inhabitants of Sodom could not do; for he who knows the will of the Lord and does it not, sins more than he who does not know it. Moreover, all those with whom the love of self is dominant despise the holy things of heaven and the church, and deny the Divine of the Lord; and to confirm the evils flowing forth from that love they either adulterate the Word or reject it as a writing that is holy only from having been so accepted. Those, therefore, who do this from the love of self are compared to Sodom and Gomorrah. [9] That those who are taught by the Lord respecting the truths and goods of the church, and yet reject and deny them, do worse than those in Sodom, is evident from the Lord’s words respecting Capernaum, in Matthew: Thou Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be brought down unto hell; for if the mighty works had been done in Sodom which were done in thee it would have remained until this day; I say unto thee25 that it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment than for thee26 (Matt. 11:23, 24).

For no one rejects the holy things of the church and denies the Divine of the Lord more interiorly than those do who are in the love of self; those who are in the love of the world and in the evils therefrom may reject the holy things of the church, but not so interiorly, that is, from the confirmation of the heart. [10] Like things are said of the prophets and the people who adulterate the truths and goods of the Word to confirm evils and falsities. In Jeremiah: In the prophets of Jerusalem I have seen a horrible stubbornness, in adulterating and walking in a lie, while they have strengthened the hands of the evil that no man doth return from his wickedness; they are become to Me as Sodom, and the inhabitants thereof as Gomorrah (Jer. 23:14).

And as the falsities that flow forth from the evils of the love of self have in them pride, for man then thinks from what is his own, therefore “Egypt” here signifies also the pride of self-intelligence.

These with their affections and pleasantnesses do not appear to man’s mani fest sense and sight, as the cognitions and knowledges of the natural man do, for the reason that so long as a man lives in the world he thinks naturally and speaks naturally, and this a man sensibly feels and perceives by a kind of sight that belongs to his understanding. But his spiritual thought, which is conjoined to the affection of truth or of falsity, is not apparent until man has put off the natural body and put on the spiritual body, which takes place after his death, or his departure from this world and his entrance into the spiritual world; then he thinks spiritually and speaks spiritually, and not naturally as before. This takes place with every man, whether he be merely natural or also spiritual; and even with the merely natural man after death thought is spiritual, but gross and without the understanding of truth or the affection of good; for it consists of correspondent ideas, which appear to be material, and yet they are not material.

But because they made for themselves images according to correspondences, and because when from being internal they became altogether external they began to worship them with holy rites and thereby made them their idols, therefore they turned the representatives of things spiritual and celestial into things idolatrous and also into things magical, therefore in the Word “Egypt” came to signify in a bad sense, which is the contrary of the former sense, the false knowledge of the natural man, and also what is idolatrous and magical."

With every man of the church the internal must be conjoined to the external, or the internal-spiritual man to the external-natural man; and when these are conjoined the spiritual man, because it is in the light of heaven, has dominion over the natural man which is in the light of the world, and rules it as a master rules a servant, and teaches it as a teacher teaches a pupil. It is from this conjunction that a man is a man of the church and an angel. But when the natural man is not conjoined to the spiritual and subject to it, as is especially the case when the spiritual man is closed up (and it is closed up with those who deny the Divine things of the Word and of the church, for they then see nothing from the light of heaven), then the natural man is blind in respect to spiritual things, and by his rational perverts all the truths of the church, and by his ideas of them turns them with himself into falsities.

Without the spiritual sense who could understand these prophecies?

One end of the land of Canaan was the river Euphrates and the other was the river of Egypt. The extension of truth from one end to the other is signified by “from sea to sea,” and the extension of good from one end to the other by “from mountain to mountain.” [12] That the land of Canaan, which signifies the church, extended from the river of Egypt to the Euphrates, the river of Assyria, appears in Moses: In that day Jehovah made a covenant with Abram, saying, To thy seed I will give this land, from the river of Egypt even to the great river, the river Euphrates (Gen. 15:18). And in the first book of Kings: Solomon was ruler over all kingdoms from the river Euphrates to the land of the Philistines, and even to the lands of Egypt (1 Kings 4:21). For the church, which in itself is spiritual, has its boundaries in the natural man, that is, in its rational and knowing faculties, for the rational is in the interior natural man, for it is its understanding; in it also is the knowing faculty; and the rational is born by means of knowledges, for in these it sees its conclusions as in a mirror, and confirms itself by them, but yet from the spiritual; without this man has no rational, nor has he any true knowing faculty, but in place of the rational he has an ability to reason, and in place of a true knowing faculty he has a false knowing faculty; so these two constitute the boundaries of the spiritual church, which is signified by “the land of Canaan.” [13] In Ezekiel: Son of man, say unto Pharaoh king of Egypt and to his multitude, Whom art thou like in thy greatness?

In its branches all the birds of the heavens built their nests, and under its branches every beast of the field has brought forth, and in its shade dwelt all great nations; it was beautiful in its greatness, in the length of its branches, for its root was by many waters. The cedars in the garden of God have not hidden it; the fir trees were not equal to its branches, nor was any tree in the garden of God equal to it in its beauty; they have made it beautiful by the multitude of its branches, and all the trees of Eden which are in the garden of God envied it (Ezek. 31:2–9). It is because “Pharaoh king of Egypt” signifies the understanding of the natural man, which is born and formed out of true knowledges rationally seen, that he is here called “Asshur,” which signified the rational, and is described by a cedar and its height, and the length and multitude of its branches, and this is because the “cedar” signifies in the Word the rational. (But most of this passage may be seen explained above, n. 650d.) Because the rational is such in respect to the intellectual, and the natural is such in respect to true knowledges it is said that “the cedars in the garden of God did not hide it, and the fir trees were not equal to its branches, nor was any tree in the garden of God equal to it in beauty”; “the garden of God” signifying the intelligence which the man of the church has who is in genuine truths, “the cedar,” his rational which is from a spiritual origin, “the fir tree,” the perceptive faculty of the natural man, “beauty,” the affection of truth and the consequent intelligence; “they have made it beautiful by the multitude of branches” signifies the abundance of true knowledges rationally perceived; “all the trees of Eden which are in the garden of God envied it” signifies perceptions of truth from celestial good, whence is wisdom, “trees” where the celestial man is treated of signifying perceptions, and where the spiritual man is treated of cognitions, and “Eden in the garden of God” signifying the wisdom which is from the good of love. That Pharaoh and Egypt are here meant and described by “Asshur” and the “cedar” can be seen also from the last verse of this chapter, where it is said, “This is Pharaoh and all his multitude.” As all the intelligence and wisdom of the spiritual man closes into the"

I have digged and drunk strange waters, and I will dry up with the sole of my footsteps all the rivers of Egypt (2 Kings 19:23, 24). Similar things are signified here as in the passage cited above, namely, the rational things of the men of the church formed out of true knowledges, and enlightened from the Divine spiri tual, and yet the king of Assyria (signifying here a perverted rational) wished to destroy these, for he made war upon Hezekiah, king of Judah; but because he blasphemed these, and threatened to destroy all things of the church from first to last, which church is formed with man in his rational and his natural from the spiritual, therefore in that night a hundred and eighty-five thousand were smitten in his camp by the angel of Jehovah (verse 35). Here the “multitude of chariots” of the king of Assyria signifies the falsities of doctrine; “the height of the mountains, the sides of Lebanon,” which he wished to ascend, signify all the goods and truths of the church, which he wished to destroy; “the stature of the cedars and the choice of the fir trees” which he wished to cut down signify rational and natural truths in respect to perception; “the wood of the cultivated field” signifies knowledges; “the rivers"

[15] Every man with whom the church is to be implanted must first be instructed in knowledges, for unless the natural man is instructed by means of knowledges, which are also various experiences from worldly things and associations, a man cannot become rational; and if he does not become rational he cannot become spiritual; for the rational of man is conjoined on one side to the spiritual, that is, to heaven, and on the other side to the natural, that is, to the world. For this reason, and because a church was to be instituted with the sons of Israel therefore the natural man with them was first to be instructed, that is, in truths naturally and also scientifically understood. And in order that this might be represented and signified it came to pass that Abraham, whose posterity was to represent the church, and who was himself the head of it: Sojourned in Egypt with his wife, and abode there for a time (Gen. 12:10, et seq.); and afterwards: Jacob with his sons, who were then called the sons of Israel, went down by command into Egypt, and dwelt in Goshen, which was the best of the lands of Egypt, and there remained a long time (Gen. 46, et seq.) This was done because man must be instructed in truths scientifically and naturally before he is instructed spiritually.

This is why it is said of Abraham and Jacob that it was because of the famine in the land of Canaan that they went down into Egypt to sojourn there; it was “because of the famine,” since “famine” signifies a lack of the knowledges (cognitiones) of good and truth, together with a desire for them, and “to sojourn” in the Word signifies to be instructed. [17] This makes evident what is meant by these words in David: Thou hast caused a vine to go forth out of Egypt, thou hast driven out the nations and planted it, thou hast cleared a place before it, and hast caused its roots to be inrooted so that it filled the land; thou hast sent out its shoots unto the sea and its branches to the river (Ps. 80:8, 9, 11). “A vine out of Egypt” signifies the church, which was represented by the sons of Israel; “to drive out the nations” signifies to drive out the evils of the natural man, which are driven out by means of truths; “to plant it, to clear a place before it, and to cause its roots to be inrooted” signifies instruction according to order, that is, first to imbue with cognitions and knowledges, then to be as in the wilderness and be tempted, and afterwards to be brought into the land of Canaan, that is, into the church; these things are signified in their order by “Thou hast planted it, thou hast cleared a place before it, thou hast caused its roots to be inrooted, so that it filled the earth”; “to send out its shoots unto the sea” signifies the increase of intelligence and the extension even to the ultimates of the good and truth of the church; and “to send out branches unto the river” signifies unto the rational.

And as the sons of Israel were to represent the church, and it was according to Divine order that they should first be instructed in such things as would be serviceable to the rational and through this to the spiritual, they first sojourned in Egypt, and afterwards were led into the wilderness that they might undergo temptations, and that through these the natural man might be subdued; for man does not become rational until empty and false knowledges are removed, and the natural man is thus purified, which is effected mainly by temptations. 654d. [19] Because “Israel” in the highest sense means the Lord, the Lord Himself when He was an infant was carried down into Egypt, according to these words in Matthew: An angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, take the child and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I tell thee. And he arose and took the child and his mother by night and departed into Egypt, and was there until the death of Herod; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, Out of Egypt have I called My son (Matt. 2:13–15). This, again, signifies the first instruction of the Lord, for the Lord was instructed like another man, but by virtue of His Divine He received all things more intelligently and wisely than others. But this departure into Egypt was merely a representation of instruction; for as all the representatives of the Jewish and Israelitish church looked to Him, so He also represented them in Himself and completely observed them, thus fulfilling all things of the law. Since representatives were the ultimates of heaven and the church, and all prior things, which are things rational, spiritual, and celestial, enter into ultimates and are in them, so through these the Lord was in ultimates; and as all strength is in ultimates, so it was from firsts through ultimates that He subjugated all the hells, and reduced to order all things in the heavens.

[20] This makes evident what is meant by “Egypt,” where the church to be established by the Lord is treated of in the following passages. In Isaiah: Thus said Jehovah, The labor of Egypt and the merchandise of Cush and of the Sabeans, men of stature, shall pass over unto Thee, and they shall be Thine; they shall go after Thee, in bonds shall they pass over; so they shall bow themselves down towards Thee, they shall pray towards Thee; only in Thee is God, and there is no God beside (Isa. 45:14). This is said of the Lord, of whom this whole chapter treats. “The labor of Egypt and the merchandise of Cush and of the Sabeans” signifies the delight of natural love from the acquisition of the knowledges of truth and good; the knowledges themselves are signified by the “Sabeans,” who are called “men of stature” from good, for “stature” (length) signifies good and its quality, and “breadth” truth and its quality; that such will come to the church and acknowledge and worship the Lord is signified by “they shall pass over unto Thee, they shall be Thine, they shall bow themselves down towards Thee”; that the natural man with them will serve the spiritual, and thus the Lord, is signified by “in bonds shall they pass over,” for those are said “to come in bonds” in whom the cupidities pertaining to the natural man are restrained; that they will acknowledge the Lord alone to be God is meant by “they shall pray towards Him; only in Him is God, and there is no God beside.” [21] In David: Those that are fat shall come out of Egypt, Cush shall hasten her hands unto God; sing to God, O ye kingdoms of the earth, sing psalms unto the Lord (Ps. 68:31, 32)."

This, too, is said of the Lord as about to establish a church with the Gentiles; it is said “as a bird out of Egypt,” because a “bird” signifies thoughts from true knowledges; and it is said “as a dove from the land of Assyria,” because a “dove” signifies rational good from spiritual good, “Assyria” signifying the rational itself; “to make them to dwell upon their houses” signifies the interiors of a mind formed by truths from good, and thus those who are safe from the infestation of the falsities of evil. [23] In Isaiah: It shall come to pass in that day that Jehovah shall beat out from the ear of grain of the river even unto the brook of Egypt; and ye shall be collected one to another, O sons of Israel; moreover it shall come to pass in that day that the great horn shall sound, and the perishing in the land of Assyria shall come, and the outcasts from27 the land of Egypt, and shall bow down to Jehovah in the mountain of holiness, in Jerusalem (Isa. 27:12, 13). “In that day” signifies the coming of the Lord; “from the ear of grain of the river even unto the brook of Egypt, which Jehovah shall beat out,” signifies all rational truth and true knowledge that will be serviceable to the spiritual; it is said the “ear of grain” because that is what contains the grain, which signifies the truth and good that is serviceable to the spiritual man for nourishment.

These things are said of the sons of Israel who were made captives in Assyria and in Egypt; but “the sons of Israel” here and elsewhere mean the Gentiles who were to constitute the church, and “their captivity” in Assyria and in Egypt signifies the spiritual captivity which a man is in from the falsities of religion.

This, too, treats of the restoration of the church by the Lord. “To bring back out of the land of Egypt, and to gather together out of Assyria” has a similar signification as above in Isaiah where the explanation is given; “the land of Gilead and Lebanon” signifies the goods and truths of the church in the natural man; “he shall pass through the sea of distress, but shall smite the waves in the sea, and the pride of Asshur shall be cast down, and the staff of Egypt depart away” signifies that the evils and falsities of the natural man and the reasonings from knowledges that confirm them shall be dispersed; “to pass through the sea of distress” signifying temptations, the “waves” falsities and evils, “the pride of Asshur” signifies reasonings from the pride of self-intelligence, and “the staff of Egypt” knowledge confirming.

This also treats of the Lord’s coming, and of the establishment of a church by Him. “The king, Jehovah of Hosts,” whom they shall worship, means the Lord; “the feast of tabernacles” signifies the implantation of good by means of truths; that those who do not come to His church will have no influx of truth and good from the Lord is signified by “whoso goeth not up, upon them there shall be no rain”; that such as are in natural light from mere knowledges,"

This is why the knowledges of the Egyptians are called “the hidden things of gold and silver” and “desirable things” in Daniel: The king of the north shall put forth his hands over the lands, and the land of Egypt shall not escape, for he shall rule over the hidden things of gold and silver, and over all the desirable things of Egypt (Dan. 11:42, 43). 30] For this reason again the sons of Israel, when they went out of Egypt, were commanded: To borrow of the Egyptians vessels of gold and vessels of silver, and raiment, which they took away out of Egypt (Exod. 12:35, 36). “Vessels of gold and silver” and “raiment” signify the knowledges and cognitions of truth and good which were taken away from Egypt, because the Egyptians applied them to confirm evils and falsities, and turned them into things idolatrous and magical; consequently when the Egyptians were deprived of them and thus became merely natural they were shortly afterwards drowned in the Sea Suph.

These arcana are not apparent in the historical sense of the Word, but still they lie concealed in its spiritual sense. 654g. [34] Thus far the signification of “Egypt” in a good sense has been explained; now it follows that also the signification of “Egypt” in an evil or contrary sense shall be explained. In that sense “Egypt” signifies the natural man separated from the spiritual, or true knowledge separated from spiritual good, which in itself is falsity; or what is the same, faith separated from charity, which in itself is not faith. For man is born natural, and at first acquires knowledges from his teacher and parent, as also from the reading of books, and at the same time from his life in the world; and unless man becomes spiritual, that is, is born anew, the knowledges that he has acquired he applies to justify the appetites and pleasures of the natural man, in a word, its loves, which are all contrary to Divine order; and this natural man is what is signified by “Egypt” in the contrary sense, as can be seen from the following passages. [35] In Ezekiel: Because Pharaoh is lofty in stature, and hath set his top among the interwoven boughs, and his heart is exalted in his loftiness, I will give him into the hand of the strong one of the nations; according to his wickedness I have driven him out, therefore strangers shall cut him off, the violent of the nations, and they shall cast him down; upon the mountains and the valleys are his branches fallen; whence all peoples of the earth have gone down from his shadow and have deserted him; upon his ruin every bird of the heavens shall dwell, and every wild beast of the field shall be upon his branches; all shall be delivered up to death, unto the lower earth, in the midst of the sons of man, unto them that go down into the pit. In the day when he shall go down into hell I will cover the abyss for him, and I will restrain the rivers thereof, that the great waters may be held back; and I will make Lebanon black for him, and all the trees of the field shall faint for him.

The pride of self-intelligence from knowledge is meant by “he is lofty in stature, and hath set his top among the interwoven boughs, and his heart is exalted in his loftiness”; “the interwoven boughs” signify the knowledges of the natural man.

But Jehovah looking forth unto the camp of the Egyptians, discomfited them, and took off the wheel of their chariots; and the waters returned and covered the chariots and horsemen, with the whole army of Pharaoh (Exod. 14:23–25, 28; 15:19, 21). “The horses of Pharaoh” signify fanciful things, since they are fallacies, which are knowledges from a perverted understanding applied to confirm falsities; “his chariots” signify the doctrinals of falsity, and “horsemen” the reasonings therefrom; “the wheel of the chariots” signifies the ability to reason. (But these things are explained in Arcana Coelestia, n. 8208–8219, 8332–8335, 8343.) [46] Because of this signification of “the horses of Egypt” it was commanded through Moses, that: If the people desire a king, a king should be set over them whom Jehovah God should choose out of the midst of the sons of Israel; a man that is an alien who is not thy brother shall not be set over them. Only he shall not multiply to himself horses, nor shall he bring back the people into Egypt that he may multiply horses; for Jehovah hath said to you, You shall not return by this way anymore; neither shall he multiply to himself wives, that his heart turn not away; neither shall he multiply exceedingly to himself silver and gold (Deut. 17:15–17). What these directions to a king signify no one can see who does not know what is signified in the spiritual sense by a “king,” by the “sons of Israel,” by “Egypt and its horses,” also by “wives,” and by “silver and gold.” A “king” signifies truth from good; “Egypt” the natural man; “his horses” knowledges; “wives” the affections of truth and good; and “silver and gold” the truths and goods of the church, and in the contrary sense its falsities and evils; and as a “king” signifies truth from good, and the “sons of Israel” the church from those who are in truths from good, it is said that “if the people desire, a king shall be set over them whom Jehovah God shall choose out of the midst of the sons of Israel; a man that is an alien who is not thy brother shall not be set over them,” “a man that is an alien who is not a brother” signifying a religious principle not agreeing, as also falsity in which there is no good."

Other like things are prescribed in the law of the king (1 Sam. 8:10–18). Because Solomon not only procured for himself horses from Egypt, but also multiplied wives, and heaped up silver and gold, he became an idolater, and after his death the kingdom was divided.

Where now are thy wise men?” signifies that the wisdom and intelligence of the natural man from the spiritual have perished, for the natural man is formed to receive intelligence and wisdom from the spiritual man, and this takes place when they both act as one, like cause and effect; “the princes of Zoan have become fools, the princes of Noph are carried away,” signifies that the truths of wisdom and intelligence from spiritual light in the natural man are turned into the falsities of insanity; Zoan and Noph were in the land of Egypt, and signified the enlightenment of the natural man from spiritual light; “and they have seduced Egypt, the cornerstone of the tribes” signifies that the natural man has been perverted, on which, nevertheless, all the truths and the goods of the church have their foundation; “there shall be no work for Egypt that may make head and tail, branch and rush” signifies that they no longer have any intelli gence or knowledge of truth, consequently no truth either spiritual or natural. 654i.

The man of the church from being spiritual becomes natural when he separates faith from charity, that is, believes the Word but does not live according to its commands; so also when he claims to himself intelligence and does not attribute it to the Lord; from this is the conceit whereby man becomes natural. For man is first natural, afterwards he becomes rational, and lastly spiritual. When man is natural he is in Egypt, when he becomes rational, he is in Assyria, and when he becomes spiritual he is in the land of Canaan, thus in the church."

This, too, treats of the man of the church who by the falsities of doctrine and the evils of life therefrom becomes external and merely natural. “Thou hast forsaken Jehovah at the time when He led thee in the way” signifies a turning away from being reformed by the Lord by means of truths that lead; “what hast thou to do with the way of Egypt, to drink the waters of Shihor?” signifies instruction solely from the natural man, from which there are mere falsities; “what hast thou to do with the way of Assyria, to drink the waters of the river?” signifies reasonings from the natural man from which are the falsities of faith; “why goest thou off actively to change thy way?” signifies strong opposition to being so reformed as to become spiritual; “thou shalt be ashamed of Egypt also as thou wast ashamed of Assyria” signifies that it is a perverse and vile state to be led by the natural man and by reasonings therefrom, because this is to be led by falsities and evils from the selfhood.

We frequently read, in both the historical and the prophetical parts of the Word, that the Israelitish people burned with a desire to return into Egypt, and that this was forbidden them, and they were threatened with plagues and punishments if they did so; but the reason for this has heretofore been known to no one. The reason was that the sons of Israel were to represent a church from its first rise to its end; and the church is first formed with man by knowledges and cognitions in the natural man, for by these the natural man is first cultivated; for every man is born natural, therefore the natural must first be cultivated in order that it may finally serve as a basis for man’s intelligence and wisdom. Afterwards by means of knowledges and cognitions which are implanted in the natural man, an intellectual is formed, that man may become rational. But in order that a man from being rational"

Finally when man has in this way been made rational he then is made spiritual, for the rational is the medium between the spiritual and the natural, consequently the spiritual flows into the rational, and through this into the natural. [63] In a word, a man must first enrich the memory with knowledges, afterwards by these his understanding must be cultivated, and finally the will. The memory belongs to the natural man, the understanding to the rational, and the will to the spiritual. This is the way of man’s reformation and regeneration. This is why the sons of Israel were first led into Egypt, afterwards into the wilderness to undergo temptations, and finally into the land of Canaan, for as has been said, they were to represent the church from its first rise to its last end. Their abiding and sojourning in Egypt represented the instruction of the natural man; their wanderings forty years in the wilderness represented the temptations by which the rational man is formed; and the land of Canaan, into which they were finally brought, represented the church, which regarded in itself is spiritual. [64] But they who are not willing to be reformed and regenerated stop at the first stage, and remain natural; and this is why the sons of Israel, who were not willing, so often desired to return to Egypt (which desire of theirs is frequently mentioned in the book of Exodus); for they were natural, and were scarcely capable of becoming spiritual, and yet they were to represent those things that belong to the spiritual church; for this reason they were led into Egypt, and afterwards into the wilderness, and finally into the land of Canaan, thus representing the rise, progress, and final establishment of the church with man.

Oholah committed whoredom while subject to Me, and loved the Assyrians her neighbors, and bestowed her whoredoms upon the choice of all the sons of Asshur. Yet she forsook not her whoredoms from Egypt, for they lay with her in her youth. Therefore I gave her into the hand of her lovers, the sons of Asshur. They disclosed her nakedness, they took her sons and her daughters, and her they finally slew with the sword. Her sister Oholibah saw, and corrupted her love more than she, and her whoredoms above the whoredoms of her sister; she doted upon the sons of Asshur. For she increased her whoredoms, when indeed she saw men painted upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans painted with vermilion, all having the semblance of captains, the likeness of the sons of Babylon, of the Chaldeans. And the sons of Babylon came to her to the bed of loves, and they defiled her with their whoredom. She multiplied her whoredoms when she remembered the days of her youth, in which she committed whoredom in the land of Egypt. She doted upon their concubines, because their flesh was the flesh of asses, and their issue the issue of horses. Thus didst thou commend the crime of thy youth, when thou didst adorn thy breasts from Egypt. Therefore, Oholibah, I will stir up thy lovers against thee, the sons of Babylon, and all the Chaldeans, and all the Assyrians with them. They shall take thy sons and thy daughters, and thy posterity shall be devoured by fire. They shall strip thee of thy garments, and shall take away the jewels of thine adorning. Thus will I make thy crime to cease from thee, and thy whoredom from the land of Egypt, that thou lift not up thine eyes unto them, nor remember Egypt anymore. Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and grief, with the cup of wasting and desolation (Ezek. 23:2–33, and further to the end). To make clear that “Egypt” signifies the natural man, here the natural separated from the spiritual, and “Asshur” the rational, here reasoning from things belonging to the natural man, I will give a summary explanation of the above. “There were two women, the daughters of one mother, who committed whoredom in Egypt,” signifies the falsifications of truth and good, and as the sons of Jacob were merely natural men, they imbibed “the idolatries of the Egyptians,” which signifies that they falsified all the truths of the church; “their names were Oholah the elder, which is Samaria, and Oholibah which is Jerusalem,” signifies both the spiritual and the celestial church, which were represented by the posterity of Jacob, the Israelites who were in Samaria representing the spiritual church,"

(That “wood” signifies good, and in the contrary sense evil, and that a “stone” signifies truth, and in the contrary sense falsity, may be seen in Arcana Coelestia, n. 643, 3720, 8354.) But as it has not been known heretofore why the Jews and Israelites had the punishment of the cross and the punishment of stoning, and it is important that it should be known, I will cite some confirmations from the Word to show that these two punishments were representative. [5] That “hanging upon wood” or “crucifixion” was inflicted because of the destruction of good in the church, and that it thus"

In Moses: If there be a stubborn and rebellious son, obeying not the voice of his father or mother, all the men of the city shall stone him with stones that he may die. And if there be in a man a crime and judgment of death, and he be put to death, thou shalt hang him upon wood; his carcass shall not remain overnight upon the wood, but burying thou shalt bury him the same day; for he that is hanged is a curse of God, and thou shalt not defile thy land (Deut. 21:18, 20–23). “Not obeying the voice of father or mother” signifies in the spiritual sense to live contrary to the precepts and truths of the church, therefore the penalty for it was stoning; “the men of the city who were to stone him” signify those who are in the doctrine of the church, “city” signifying doctrine. “If there be in a man a crime, a judgment of death, thou shalt hang him upon wood” signifies if one has done evil against the good of the Word and of the church; because this was a capital crime he was to be hung upon wood, for in the Word “wood” signifies good, and in the contrary sense evil; “his carcass shall not remain overnight upon the wood, but thou shalt bury him the same day,” signifies lest there be a representative of eternal damnation; “thou shalt not defile thy land” signifies that this would be a cause of offense to the church. [6] In Lamentations: Our skins are become black like an oven because of the tempests of famine; they ravished the women in Zion, the virgins in the cities of Judah; their princes were hanged up by the hand, the faces of the elders are not honored, the young men they have led away to grind, and the boys stumble under the wood (Lam. 5:10–13). “Zion” means the celestial church, which is in the good of love to the Lord, which church the Jewish nation represented; “the virgins in the cities of Judah” signify the affections of truth from the good of love; “their princes were hanged up by the hand” signifies that truths from good were destroyed by falsities from evil; “the faces of the elders that were not honored” signify the goods of wisdom; “the young men who were led away to grind” signify the truths from"

[7] A “baker” as also “bread” signifies the good of love, and a “butler” as also “wine,” the truth of doctrine, therefore: The baker was hanged on account of his crime against king Pharaoh (Gen. 40:19–22; 41:13). This may be seen explained in Arcana Coelestia (n. 5139–5169). Because “Moab” means those who adulterate the goods of the church, and “Baal-peor” signifies the adulteration of good, it came to pass that: All the chiefs of the people were hung up before the sun, because the people committed whoredom with the daughters of Moab and bowed themselves down to their gods, and joined themselves to Baal- peor (Num. 25:1–4). “To commit whoredom with the daughters of Moab” signifies to adulterate the goods of the church; and “to be hung up before the sun” signifies a condemnation and curse because of the destruction of the good of the church. [8] Because “Ai” signifies the knowledges of good, and in the contrary sense the confirmations of evil: The king of Ai was hanged on wood, and afterwards thrown down at the entrance of the gate of the city, and the city itself was burned (Josh. 8:26–29). And because “the five kings of the Amorites” signified evils and falsities therefrom destroying the goods and truths of the church, Those kings were hanged by Joshua, and afterwards cast into the cave of Makkedah (Josh. 10:26, 27); “the cave of Makkedah” signifying direful falsity from evil."

[9] Again, “to be hung upon wood or to be crucified” signifies the punishment of evil that destroys the good of the church, in Matthew: Jesus said, I send unto you prophets, wise men, and scribes; and some of them shall ye kill, crucify, and scourge in your synagogues, and persecute them from city to city (Matt. 23:34). All things the Lord spoke He spoke from the Divine, but the Divine things from which he spoke fell into the ideas of natural thought and consequent expressions according to correspondences, like these here and elsewhere in the Gospels; and as all the words have a spiritual sense, so in that sense prophets, wise men, and scribes are not here meant, but instead of them the truth and good of doctrine and of the Word; for spiritual thought and speech therefrom, like that of angels, is without the idea of person; so a “prophet” signifies the truth of doctrine, “wise men” the good of doctrine, and “scribes” the Word from which is doctrine; from this it follows that “to kill” has reference to the truth of the doctrine of the church, which is meant by a “prophet”; “to crucify” has reference to the good of doc trine, which is meant by “a wise man,” and “to scourge” has reference to the Word, which is meant by a “scribe”; thus “to kill” signifies to extinguish, “to crucify” to destroy, and “to scourge” to pervert. That they will wander from one falsity of doctrine into another is signified by “persecuting them from city to city,” “city” signifying doctrine. This is the spiritual sense of these words. [10] In the same: Jesus said to the disciples that He must suffer at Jerusalem, and that the Son of man shall be delivered to the chief priests and scribes, and they shall condemn Him, and deliver Him up to the Gentiles to be mocked, to be scourged, and to be crucified; and the third day He shall rise again (Matt. 20:18, 19; Mark 10:32–34). The spiritual sense of these words is that Divine truth, in the church where mere falsities of doctrine and evils of life reign, shall be blasphemed, its truth shall be perverted, and its good destroyed. “The Son of man” signifies Divine truth, which is the Word, and"

For it was a common thing for a prophet to take upon himself a representation of the heinous things of the church; thus the prophet Isaiah was commanded to go naked and barefoot three years, to represent the church as destitute of good and truth (Isa. 20:3, 4); the prophet Ezekiel, bound in cords, laid siege to a tile on which Jerusalem was depicted, and ate a cake of barley made with the dung of an ox, to represent that the truth and good of the church was thus besieged by falsities and polluted by evils (Ezek. 4:1–13); the prophet Hosea was commanded to take a harlot to himself for a woman, and children of whoredoms, to represent what the quality of the church was at that time (Hos. 1:1–11); with other like things."

From this it can be seen that “peoples and tribes” signify all who are in the truths or falsities of religion and of doctrine, here those who are in falsities, because it is said, “they shall see the bodies of the witnesses three days and a half, and shall not suffer them to be placed in sepulchers.” This is evident also from the signification of “tongues and nations,” as being those who are in the evils of doctrine and of life, for “tongues” signify the goods or evils of doctrine, and thence of religion (see above, n. 330, 455, 625); and “nations” signify the goods or evils of life (see also above, n. 175, 331, 625); from which it can be seen that “tongues and nations” signify all who are in the goods or the evils of doctrine and of life, here those who are in the evils, since it is said of them that “they shall see the bodies of the witnesses upon the street of the great city, and shall not suffer them to be placed in sepulchers.” 658. Their bodies three days and a half, signifies the complete extinction of Divine truth and of Divine good.30 This is evident from the signification of “bodies” (that is, of the “witnesses”), as being those who have extinguished with themselves all Divine truth and Divine good; for “the two witnesses,” whom they killed, signify the goods of love and charity and the truths of doctrine and faith (see above, n. 228, 635); consequently “their bodies when killed” signify that these have been extinguished; but because the good of love and charity and the truth of doctrine and faith can be extinguished only with those who are in falsities of doctrine and in evils of life, these are meant, since others do not see that the goods of love and the truths of doctrine are extinguished; for everyone sees the things that are of the Lord, and thus of heaven and the church, according to what his state is, since from that he sees; consequently he can see no otherwise than in accord with what that"

Thus he who denies the Lord and His Divine in heaven and in the church sees them not, because he sees from the negative; therefore such a one does not see the witnesses alive, but their bodies as carcasses, that is, the goods of love and the truths of doctrine as no truths and goods, consequently as extinguished. The above is evident also from the signification of “three days and a half,” as meaning what is complete, here complete extinction. [2] “Three and a half” means completeness, because “three” signifies an entire period or duration from beginning to end, consequently where the church is treated of, as here, “three and a half” signifies even to the end, and at the same time to a new beginning of it; therefore it is added “after three days and a half the spirit of life from God entered into them and they stood upon their feet,” which signifies the beginning of a new church after the end of the old. For at the end of the church all the good of love and the truth of doctrine is extinguished, but then there is a resuscitation, which is effected with those with whom a new church is established by the Lord, and this is signified by “the spirit of life” that entered into them. “Three days and a half” signifies a complete or full state for this reason also, that this number has a similar signification as the number “seven,” for it is half of it, and a number halved, or a number doubled, has a similar signification as the number that is halved or doubled; and the number “seven” signifies all, likewise what is full and complete, and is predicated of what is holy pertaining to heaven and the church. Respecting the signification of this number see above (n. 20, 24, 257, 300). That the greater numbers that are composed of smaller ones have a similar signification as the simple numbers from which they arise by multiplication, may be also seen above (n. 430a, b); and that “three” signifies an entire period greater or less from beginning to end (above, n. 532). 659a. And shall not suffer [their bodies] to be placed in sepulchers, signifies the rejection and damnation of such.

For after death a man continues to live equally as in the world, but he lays aside the earthly or material body, which served him for use in the natural world, and continues his life in a spiritual body. Burial, therefore, is only the rejection, as it were, of the exuviae that he carried about in the natural world. Burial signifies awakening into eternal life or resurrection, because the angels do not know what the death of a man is nor what his burial is, since with them there is no death and therefore no burial, but they perceive all things spiritually; when, therefore, the death of a man is mentioned in the Word, instead of death they perceive his passing over from one world into another; and where burial is mentioned they perceive his resurrection into life. It follows from this that “not to be buried” signifies resurrection not into life, but into damnation, which means spiritual death. Every man, indeed, after his departure out of the world is awakened and rises again, but some to life and some to damnation, and as “to be buried” signifies resurrection to life, so “not to be buried” signifies damnation, but here of those who reject the goods of love and the truths of doctrine, which are signified by “the two witnesses”; consequently “not to be placed in sepulchers” (or not to be buried) does not mean damnation except in the idea of those who condemn such goods and truths. Therefore what “sepulchers” signify in the Word, as also “to be buried” and “not to be buried,” can be seen from the following passages. [2] That “sepulchers,” because of the dead bodies and bones in them, signify things unclean, and thus things infernal, can be seen from many passages in the Word. As in Isaiah: A people that provoke Me to anger continually before My faces; that burn incense upon bricks, that sit in sepulchers and lodge in waste places, that eat swine’s flesh (Isa. 65:3, 4). “To provoke Jehovah to anger before His faces” signifies to sin against the truths and goods of the Word, and to fall away from the worship therein commanded, “the faces of Jehovah” meaning the things revealed in the Word; “to burn incense upon bricks” signifies worship from falsities of doctrine, “bricks” meaning the"

[3] In Moses: Whosoever shall touch one upon the surface of the field that is slain by a sword, or a dead body, or the bone of a man, or a sepulcher, shall be unclean seven days, and afterwards he shall be purified (Num. 19:16, 18). “To touch” signifies in the Word to communicate; therefore that falsities and evils be not communicated and thus appropriated it was forbidden to touch things unclean, here “one slain by a sword,” a “dead body,” “the bone of a man,” or a “sepulcher”; since “one slain by a sword” signifies one who has been destroyed by falsities, and has thence been condemned to hell; and a “dead body” signifies one who has been destroyed by evils; “the bone of a man” signifies infernal falsity, and a “sepulcher” infernal evil. [4] In Ezekiel: Wail over the multitude of Egypt, and cast her down with them that go down into the pit. They shall fall in the midst of them that are slain by the sword. Asshur is there and all his assembly, his sepulchers are round about him, all the slain who have fallen by the sword, to whom sepulchers were given in the sides of the pit, and his assembly is round about his sepulcher. Elam and all his multitude is round about his sepulcher, all the uncircumcised slain by the sword (Ezek. 32:18, 20, 22–24). “The multitude of Egypt” signifies the knowledges of the natural man, which are dead because they do not come down and take form as effects, conclusions, and confirmations, from the truths of the spiritual man; “Asshur” signifies reasonings from such knowledges; therefore “Wail over the multitude of Egypt, and cast her down with them that go down into the pit,” signifies grief because of the damnation of those who are in these knowledges, the"

[5] It is to be known that falsities and evils of every kind correspond to unclean and loathsome things in the natural world, and the more direful falsities and evils to things pertaining to dead bodies and to fetid excrementitious things, and the milder falsities and evils to things pertaining to swamps; consequently the dwelling places in the hells of those who are in such falsities and evils appear like pits and sepulchers; and if you will believe it, such evil genii and spirits also have their abode in the sepulchers, privies, and swamps that are in our world, although they do not know it; this is so because they correspond, and the things that correspond conjoin. The same conclusion may be drawn from this, that to those who have been assassins and poisoners, and to those who have perceived delight in violating women, there is nothing more delightful than the odor of a corpse; and to those who have been eaten up with the love of ruling, and to those who have taken delight in adulteries, and no delight in marriages, there is nothing more delightful than the odor of excrement; and to those who have confirmed themselves in falsities, and have extinguished in themselves the affection of truth, there is nothing more delightful than the odor of a swamp and of urinous places. This is why the hells in which they dwell appear according to the corresponding delights, some like pits and some like sepulchers. [6] From this it appears why it was: That those that were obsessed by demons were in sepulchers and came out therefrom (Matt. 8:28 seq.; Mark 5:2, 3, 5; Luke 8:27);"

They were “cast into swine” [because while they lived in the world they had been in sordid avarice],31 and this is what “swine” correspond to and thence signify; they “cast themselves headlong into the sea” because the “sea” here signifies hell.

[8] There is now added a prayer from grief that he may be delivered from temptations, and for this among other reasons, “Shall Thy mercy be declared in the sepulcher, and Thy truth in destruction?” which signifies that in hell, where and from which are evils and falsities, Divine good and Divine truth cannot be proclaimed, “mercy” meaning the Divine good of the Divine love, and “truth” the Divine truth of the Divine wisdom, “sepulcher” meaning the hell where and from which are evils, and “destruction” the hell where and from which are falsities. From this it appears that “sepulcher” means hell, because they who are in hell are spiritually dead.

[12] So when those who are in falsities from evil are treated of, by “their sepulcher” the hell from which and in which there is such falsity is meant; but when those who are in truths from good are treated of, “sepulcher” means the removal and rejection of falsity from evil, and “burial” means awakening and resurrection into life, as also regeneration. For with a man who is in truths from good, falsity from evil is removed and rejected into hell, and the man himself, in respect to his interiors, which belong to his spirit, rises again and enters into the life of truth from good, which is the spiritual life. In this sense “burial” is to be understood in the following passages.

This treats of the dry bones seen by the prophet upon the faces of the valley; upon these sinews appeared to be stretched and flesh came up, and skin covered them; and when the Spirit of God came into them they lived again and stood upon their feet. That by these bones the whole house of Israel was meant is openly declared in these words: Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel; behold they say, Our bones are dried up, our hope is perished; as for us we are cut off (Ezek. 37:11). This house was likened to “dry bones” because they were in falsities and evils, which have no life because of their non-correspondence with heaven in respect to sinews, flesh, and skin, for “bones” signify truths in the ultimate of order, upon which spiritual truths are based, and “dry bones” signify falsities from evil; this makes clear that “to open the sepulchers and to cause the people to come up out of the sepulchers” signifies to raise up out of falsities from evil,"

[ 15] It is related in Matthew: That after the passion of the Lord the tombs were opened, and many bodies of those that slept coming out of their tombs went into the holy city, and appeared to many (Matt. 27:52, 53). That “the tombs were opened, and many bodies of them that slept appeared,” has a similar signification as above in Ezekiel, where it is said that “Jehovah was to open the sepulchers and cause them to come up out of the sepulchers,” namely, the regeneration and resurrection of the faithful unto life; not that the bodies themselves that lay in the tombs rose again, but that there was this appearance, that regeneration and resurrection to life from the Lord might be signified. Furthermore, these same words mean those who in the Word are said “to be bound in the pit,” whom the Lord delivered when He had finished the whole work of redemption. For many of the faithful could not be saved until the Lord had come into the world and subjugated the hells; in the meanwhile they were detained in the places called “pits” until the Lord came, but were delivered by the Lord immediately after His coming. These pits were represented also by the “tombs” that were opened, and those who were in them by those that “slept,” who after the Lord’s resurrection, as it is said, “appeared to many in the holy city”; “the holy city” was Zion and Jerusalem, but by them heaven is meant, to which they were raised up by the Lord, for both Zion and Jerusalem were profane rather than holy. This makes evident what that miracle and that appearance represented and signified. [16] Since “the land of Canaan” signifies both the church and heaven, and “burial” signifies resurrection into life, so: Abraham bought of Ephron a field in which was the cave of Machpelah which was before Mamre (Gen. 23);"

The particulars related concerning that cave, namely, that it was “in the field of Ephron, which was before Mamre,” and many others, were significative of resurrection unto life (as may be seen explained in Arcana Coelestia). For this reason Joseph also commanded: That his bones should be brought up into the land of Canaan (Gen. 50:24–26); And this was done (Exod. 13:19; Josh. 24:32); and for the reason that “the land of Canaan,” as has been said, signified the heavenly Canaan, which is heaven. Because of the representation of resurrection into heaven by burial: David and the kings after him were buried in Zion (1 Kings 2:10; 11:43; 14:17, 18; 15:8, 24; 22:50; 2 Kings 8:24; 12:21; 14:20; 15:7, 38; 16:20). This was because “Zion” signified the celestial church and heaven, where the Lord is. [17] That “burial” signifies resurrection can also be seen from this, that the dead are frequently said to have been “gathered to their fathers,” and “to their peoples”; “to their fathers” in Genesis: Jehovah said to Abraham, Thou shalt come to thy fathers in peace, and shalt be buried in a good old age (Gen. 15:15). And in the second book of Kings: Jehovah said of Josiah, king of Judah, Behold I gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered into thy sepulcher in peace (2 Kings 22:20).

It cannot mean that they were gathered to their fathers and to their peoples in the sepulcher, for it is also said of Abraham when he died, that he “was gathered to his fathers” and that he was “gathered to his peoples,” yet he was buried in a new tomb, where none of his fathers or of his peoples were before him, except Sarah his wife. [18] In Job: Thou shalt know that thy tent is peace, and thy children as the herb of the land, thou shalt come in old age unto the sepulcher like the coming up of a heap of corn in its season (Job 5:24–26). A “tent” signifies in the Word the holiness of worship and the good of love, because Divine worship in most ancient times was performed in tents; and because their worship was from the good of celestial love, a “tent” signifies also that good; and since there is genuine peace in celestial good therefore it is said, “Thou shalt know that thy tent is peace.” Truths from that good and their increase are signified by “the children which shall be as the herb of the land,” for “sons” and “children” and likewise “the herb of the land” signify truths from good; that when wisdom has been imbibed one shall come into heaven is signified by “thou shalt come in old age into the sepulcher,” “old age” signifying wisdom, and “to come into the sepulcher” or “to be buried” signifying resurrection; and as this is the meaning it is added, “like the coming up of a heap of corn in its season.”"

      "text": "APOCALYPSE EXPLAINED 2254 [19] From these few passages it may appear that “sepulchers,” by reason of the dead bodies and inanimate bones therein, signify things infernal, but that “burial” signifies the rejection of these and consequently resurrection; for when a man rejects or puts off his material body he puts on a spiritual body, with which he rises again. For this reason the very death of man signifies in the spiritual sense the continuation of his life, but in an evil sense it signifies damnation, which is spiritual death. As in respect to man “burial” signifies resurrection and also regeneration, therefore in respect to the Lord it signified the glorification of His Human; for the Lord glorified, that is, made Divine, His entire Human, consequently on the third day He rose again with the Human glorified, that is, made Divine. Unless this had been done, no man could have risen again to life; for man has resurrection unto life solely from the Lord, and indeed from His having united the Divine with His Human, and from this union, or strictly speaking, glorification, man has salvation; this is involved in: What the Lord said of the woman who poured balsamic ointment upon His head, that she did it unto His burial (Matt. 26:7, 12; Mark 14:8; John 12:7); for “anointing” signifies that glorification; because from it man has salvation it is said of this woman: Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, that also which this woman hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her (Matt. 26:13). This, too, was represented by: The man that was cast into the sepulcher of Elisha, who revived when he touched his bones (2 Kings 13:20, 21). For “Elisha” represented the Lord in relation to Divine truth, and this constitutes the life of heaven into which man is raised up."

[20] Since “to be buried” and “burial” signify both resuscitation into life and regeneration; so “not to be buried” and “to be dragged out of the tombs” signifies no resurrection to heaven nor regeneration, but resurrection to hell, and accordingly damnation, as in the following passages. In Isaiah: Thou art cast out of thy sepulcher like an abominable shoot, the vesture of those that are slain, of those thrust through with the sword, that go down to the stones of the pit, like a carcass trodden down; thou shalt not be united with them in the sepulcher, for thou hast destroyed thy land, thou hast slain thy people; the seed of the wicked shall not be named forever (Isa. 14:19, 20). This is said of the king of Babylon, by whom the profanation of Divine truth is signified; therefore “thou art cast out of thy sepulcher” signifies damnation to hell; “like an abominable shoot, the vesture of those that are slain, of those thrust through with the sword,” signifies the falsification of truth and its profanation; “an abominable shoot” means truth falsified, and “the vesture of those that are slain, of those thrust through with the sword,” means truth adulterated and utterly destroyed by direful falsities; “that go down to the stones of the pit, like a carcass trodden down,” signifies to the hell where the falsities of evil are, “a carcass trodden down” signifying an infernal spirit, with whom everything is spiritually dead because of the total destruction of good; “thou shalt not be united with them in the sepulcher” signifies no consociation with those who rise again to life, for “to be in the sepulcher or to be buried” signifies that resurrection, and on the other hand, “to be cast out of the sepulcher” signifies damnation; “thou hast destroyed thy land, thou hast slain thy people,” signifies that the church and those therein who are in truths from good have been destroyed by the falsities of evil; “the seed of the wicked shall not be named forever” signifies eternal dissociation and separation. [21] In Jeremiah: Jehovah hath said concerning the sons and concerning the daughters that are born in this place, and concerning their mothers that shall bear them, and concerning their fathers that shall beget them in this land, They shall die of grievous deaths, that they may not be lamented, neither buried; they shall be for dung upon the faces of the"

This is said of the church vastated in respect to all good and truth; “sons and daughters, and mothers and fathers” do not mean in the spiritual sense sons and daughters, mothers and fathers, but the truths and goods of the church both exterior and interior, “sons and daughters” meaning exterior truths and goods, “mothers and fathers” interior truths and goods; these are called “mothers and fathers” because they beget and bring forth the exterior; “they shall die of grievous deaths, that they may not be lamented, neither buried,” signifies condemnation to hell because of direful falsities; “they shall be for dung upon the faces of the earth” signifies infernal filth which is the evil that defiles the good and truth of the church; “to be consumed by the sword or by famine” signifies to be destroyed by falsities and evils; “that their carcass may be for food to the birds of the heavens and to the beast of the earth” signifies consumed and to be yet further consumed by the cupidities of the love of falsity and evil. [22] In the same: A tumult cometh even to the end of the earth, for Jehovah hath a controversy against the nations; He shall enter judgment with all flesh, He shall give the wicked to the sword; the slain of Jehovah shall be in that day from the end of the earth even unto the end of the earth, they shall not be lamented nor gathered nor buried, they shall be as dung upon the faces of the earth (Jer. 25:31, 33). This describes the devastation of the church at its end when the last judgment takes place. “A tumult even to the end of the earth, for Jehovah hath a controversy against the nations,” signifies the dismay of all who are of the church when they are visited and their evils are disclosed, the “earth” meaning the church, “nations” those who are in evils, and in an abstract sense evils, and “the controversy of Jehovah” against them visitation and disclosure. “He shall enter judgment with all flesh” signifies the universal judgment that takes place at the end of the church; “He shall give"

Here, too, “not to be buried” means not to rise again to life but to damnation (the rest may be seen explained above, n. 652d).

This is why “Topheth” and “the valley of Hinnom,” being most unclean and abominably idolatrous places, represented and thence signified the hells.

And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them and shall be glad, signifies delights from infernal love with those who are opposed to the goods and truths of the church. This is evident from the signification of “they that dwell upon the earth,” as being those who are in the church, here those therein who are in evils and in falsities therefrom, thus who are opposed to its goods and truths; also from the signification of “rejoicing and being glad,” as being here the delight of infernal love; for all joy and all gladness is of love, since everyone rejoices and is glad when his love is favored, and when he pursues and obtains what he loves; in a word, all the joy of man proceeds from his love and all the sadness and grief of mind from antagonism to his love. [2] It is said “rejoice and be glad” because of the marriage of good and truth; for “joy” is predicated of good because it relates to love, for it belongs especially to the heart and will, and “gladness” is predicated of truth, because it relates to the love of truth, for it belongs especially to the mind and its thought; therefore we speak of “joy of heart” and “gladness of mind.” Everywhere in the Word there are two expressions, one of which has reference to good and the other to truth, and this because it is the conjunction of good and truth that makes both heaven and the church; therefore both heaven and the church are compared to a marriage, for the reason that the Lord is called “bridegroom” and “husband,” and heaven and the church are called “bride” and “wife.” Everyone, therefore, who is not in that marriage is not an angel of heaven nor a man of the church; and the reason is that there is no good with anyone unless it is formed by truths, nor is there truth with anyone unless it is made living by good; for every truth is a form of good, and all good is the being [esse] of truth, and as one is not possible without the other it follows that there must needs be a marriage of good and truth with the man of the church as well as with an angel of heaven. Moreover, all intelligence and wisdom are from that marriage, for from it truths and goods are continually born, by which the understanding and will are formed.

Then men are tormented by the goods of love and the truths of doctrine, because inwardly or in their hearts they hate them, howsoever they may profess them with their lips; and when anything that is hated enters there is inward torment; and yet such a man of the church does not know, so long as he lives in the world, that he has so great hate for these two witnesses, and that he is inwardly tormented by them, for the reason that he does not know the state of his interior thought and affection, but only the state of his exterior thought and affection, which falls immediately into speech. But when he comes into the spiritual world his exterior thought and affection are laid asleep, and the interior are opened, and then he feels so great a repugnance from hatred against the goods of love and the truths of doctrine that he cannot endure hearing them. When, therefore, such a man enters any angelic society where spiritual love and faith rule he is grievously tormented, which is a sign of interior repugnance from hatred against love and faith. This makes clear what is signified by “those two prophets tormented them that dwell upon the earth.” “Them that dwell upon the earth” mean those in the church who are in good in respect to life, but here those who are in evil, for such are interiorly tormented by the goods of love and the truths of doctrine. That “to dwell” signifies to live, and thus life, can be seen from passages in the Word, where “to dwell” is mentioned (Isa. 9:2; 13:20; 37:16; Jer. 2:6, 15; 51:13; Dan."

This is evident from the signification of “the three days and a half,” as being fullness and completion as to the end of the old church, when there is the beginning of the new church (see above, n. 658). It is said “after the three days and a half” because in the Word “days” signify states, here the last state of the church; for in the Word all times, as “hours,” “days,” “weeks,” “months,” “years,” “ages,” signify states, as here the last state of the church, when there is no longer any good of love or truth of faith left.

This Divine proceeding is what enlightens man and flows into him when he is being reformed and regenerated, thus when the church is commencing and being established with him, as can be plainly seen from the passages quoted above from the Word (n. 183), also from this in Ezekiel: Jehovah said unto me, Prophesy about the spirit, prophesy, son of man, and say unto the wind, Thus the Lord Jehovih hath said, Come from the four winds, O spirit, and breathe into these slain, that they may live. And when I had prophesied the spirit entered into them, and they revived and stood upon their feet, a very great army (Ezek. 37:9, 10). ] This treats of “the dry bones” seen by the prophet upon the face of the valley, which signify the house of Israel, as is plainly declared in verse 11 of that chapter. “The house of Israel” signifies the church, and that house or church is here compared to “dry bones” because it had no good of love or truth of doctrine. The establishment of a new church by the inbreathing of a new life, or by regeneration, is described by the “sinews, flesh, and skin,” with which the bones were clothed and encompassed, and especially by the “spirit” that entered into them, and from which they lived; the “spirit” in them here signifies also the reception of the influx of Divine truth and consequent spiritual life. The prophet said to the wind, “Come from the four winds, O spirit,” because “the four winds” signify the four quarters in the spiritual world, and the four quarters there signify the goods of love and the truths of doctrine in the whole complex. (On the signification of these see above, n. 417, 418, 419d, e, 422, and in the work Heaven and Hell, n. 141–150.) 666.

A new life is signified because the “witnesses” who are here treated of were killed and lived again. “To stand upon the feet” here means such life as the regenerate man of the church has, because this is said of “the two witnesses,” by whom all who are in the goods of love through the truths of doctrine are meant, who are such as have been regenerated; also because when the natural, which is signified by the “feet,” has been regenerated, the whole man has life such as the regenerated man has. [2] This the Lord teaches in John: Jesus said to Peter, He that hath bathed needeth not save to wash his feet, but is all clean (John 13:10). “To wash” signifies to be purified from evils and falsities, which is to be regenerated, therefore “he that hath bathed” signifies he that has been purified, that is, regenerated in respect to the spiritual, which is the good of love and the truth of doctrine; these must first be received in the memory and understanding, that is, must be known and acknowledged. “Needeth not save to wash his feet” signifies that the natural or external man must then be purified or regenerated, which is done by a life according to the precepts of love and faith, that is, according to the goods and truths of doctrine from the Word. As this is done the man himself is purified or regenerated; for to live according to the goods and truths of doctrine from the Word is to will them and thence to do them, which is the same as to be affected by them and to love them; for what comes to be of the will comes to be of the affection and love, and therefore of the man himself; for the will is the very man, since a man is his own love and his own affection. This is why it is said that then “the whole man is clean.” [3] From this it is clear why “to stand upon the feet” means such life as a regenerate man has. Therefore of “the dry bones” seen by the prophet on the face of the valley, when they had been covered with sinews, flesh, and skin, it is said:"

Here also “to stand upon the feet” signifies a new life, such as the regenerate man has; for “the dry bones” to which the house of Israel is likened signify the state of the church with them, namely, that it had no goods of love or truths of doctrine; and “being clothed with sinews, flesh, and skin” signifies regeneration; and “the spirit that entered in” signifies a new life through the influx and reception of Divine truth; therefore it is then said that “they revived and stood upon their feet.” [4] “To stand upon the feet” has the same signification elsewhere in the same prophet: A voice speaking to me said, Son of man, stand upon thy feet that I may speak to thee; then the spirit entered into me when he spake unto me, and stood me upon my feet, and I heard him that spake to me (Ezek. 2:1, 2). I fell upon my face, but the spirit entered into me and raised me upon my feet (Ezek. 3:23, 24). This was done because “to stand upon the feet” signifies life itself when it is in its fullness; and life is in its fullness when the natural lives from the spiritual. For the ultimate of man’s life is in his natural; this ultimate is like a base to man’s interior and higher parts; for these close into the ultimate and subsist in it, consequently unless life is in the ultimate it is not full, and thus not perfect. Moreover, all things interior or higher exist together in the ultimate as in their simultaneous. For this reason such as the ultimate is such are the interior or higher parts, for these adapt themselves to the ultimate because it receives them.

Again, in the same: He made me come up out of the pit of devastation, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock (Ps. 40:2). “The pit of devastation” signifies the falsity of doctrine, and “the miry clay” the evil of life; and “to set the feet upon a rock” has a similar signification as above, “to make the feet to stand in a broad place,” for “rock” signifies the truth of doctrine from the Word, and in the highest sense, the Lord in relation to Divine truth. Thence it is clear what is signified in the spiritual sense by: Jehovah will not suffer my34 foot to totter (Ps. 121:3); namely, that he will not suffer the natural to go astray from truths; for so far as the natural goes astray, so far the interiors which belong to the understanding and will, also go astray. 667. And great fear fell upon them that beheld them, signifies a state of anxiety with those who did not receive and acknowledge. This is evident from the signification of “great fear,” as being a state of anxiety, for “fear” signifies in the Word various changes of state of man’s interiors, so here, a state of anxiety; also from the signification of “upon them that beheld them,” as being in those who could not endure the presence of the witnesses, and who therefore killed them and cast them out, and who therefore had grief of mind and anxiety of heart when they saw them alive, consequently it means with those that have not received and acknowledged the good of love and the truth of doctrine. This describes the state of those who are opposed to the goods of love and the truths of doctrine, at the end of the old and the beginning of the new church; such then come into anxiety from the presence of those who receive love to the Lord and faith in Him, of whom the new church is constituted; but this takes place in the spiritual world, not in the natural world; for in the spiritual world there is a communication of affections; and spiritual affection, which belongs to love to the Lord and faith in Him, and which then has a"

And they heard a great voice out of heaven, saying unto them, signifies the Lord’s Divine providence. This is evident from the signification of “a great voice out of heaven,” as being the Lord’s Divine providence. “A voice out of heaven” signifies all that proceeds from the Lord, which in general is called Divine truth, and with us in the world is called the Word; thus in particular every precept and command in the Word is meant; this is called “a voice out of heaven” because it descended and is continually descending from the Lord through heaven with those who read the Word from the spiritual affection of truth. The Lord’s Divine providence is here signified by “a voice out of heaven,” because the subject treated of is the state of heaven and the state of the church at its end, when the Lord provides against any sudden change that would do harm to those who are to be separated, some of whom are to come into heaven and some to be cast into hell. Therefore it now follows that the two witnesses by command “went up into heaven in the cloud, and their enemies beheld them,” and this that there might be a separation, lest the successive progress of affairs according to order might be disturbed by their presence with the evil and the consequent communication (of which above). This arcanum, however, cannot be described in a few words, but in what follows it will be elucidated as far as possible. 669. Come up hither, signifies separation and consequent protection. This is evident from the signification of “going up into heaven” when said of the witnesses, by whom the goods of love and the truths of doctrine are signified, as being to be separated from those that have no goods of love and truths of doctrine, thus to be separated from the evil. And as the reason for separation is that these, namely, the good of love and the truth of doctrine, may not be harmed by the evil, therefore “come up hither” signifies also protection. For if the good of love and the truth of doctrine were communicated to the evil they would receive them in an outward way, but would do them harm by inwardly denying and mocking"

Thence it would come to pass that the evil would be conjoined with the simple well-disposed, who are unable to perceive that the interiors of such are evil. These simple well- disposed constitute the lowest heaven; therefore if this separation were not effected, harm would be done to those who are in that heaven by their being conjoined with the externals of the evil (but on this see further in the small work Last Judgment, n. 70). This is what is involved in the command to the two witnesses “to go up into heaven,” and by this also protection is signified. 670. And they went up into heaven in the cloud, signifies separation in respect to things internal, and their protection. This is evident from the signification of “going up into heaven,” in reference to the two witnesses, as being separation from the evil, that is, from those who are in the falsities of doctrine from evils of life, and also protection (see preceding article, n. 669); also from the signification of “the cloud,” as being the ultimate of Divine truth, or the external of the Word, which is called the sense of its letter (of which above, n. 36, 594). Many of the evil also are in this external, for all who lead an evil life think in themselves in opposition to the goods and truths of the Word, of doctrine, and of the church, although they may be in the externals of these, and for this reason, that from the life they are in the love of evil, and love draws to its own side the interiors of the mind, thus the thoughts of its spirit, consequently when such are left to think alone by themselves they wholly deny those things that they confess with their lips before the world. It is this external, which is also with the impious and the evil, that is here meant by “the cloud.” For this reason, by “they went up into heaven in the cloud,” separation in respect to internals is meant, but not in respect to externals. Separation in respect to internals is meant, and not in respect to externals, because the internals of the two witnesses were spiritual and celestial, while the internals of the evil were infernal and diabolical; and internals that are celestial and spiritual are actually in heaven; therefore they are said to have “gone up thither,” in order that as to internals they might be separated from the evil, that their internals might not be harmed."

This was done by the Lord Himself, when the end of the Jewish church was at hand; for the Lord Himself then came into the world and opened the interiors of the Word, especially those relating to Himself, love to Him and love towards the neighbor, and faith in Him, which before lay hidden in the interiors of the Word, since they were in its representatives, and thence in the particular things of the church and of worship. These truths, therefore, that were disclosed by the Lord were interior truths, and in themselves spiritual; and these afterwards served the new church for doctrine and life, as has been said just above. These truths, however, were not immediately received, nor until after a considerable lapse of time, as is well known from ecclesiastical history; and for the reason that they could not be received until all things in the spiritual world had been reduced to order; for as the spiritual world is conjoined to the natural world with men, so unless that world had been first reduced to order, men in the natural world could not have understood or perceived the goods of love and the truths of doctrine; this is why so long a time intervened before the Christian church was universally established in the European world; for all effects that exist in the natural world derive their origin from causes in the spiritual world, especially those that relate to the things of the church. These things have been said to make known what is signified in particular by the command to the two witnesses “to go up into heaven,” namely, that no harm be done by the evil to the goods of love and the truths of doctrine that are disclosed in the last time of the church. [3] It was similar when the most ancient church, which was before the flood, came to its end, for then the representatives of celestial things, which existed among the most ancient people, were gathered up into one body by those who were called “Enoch,” and were preserved for the use of the new church after the flood; and"

The like was done with these, that is, they were separated from the evil by being taken into heaven and thus protected, and this till the old church came to its end, when a new church was to be established. This is described by these words in Genesis: And Enoch walked with God and he was no more, for God took him (Gen. 5:24). That such is the signification of “Enoch, and his walking before God, and being taken by God” may be seen in Arcana Coelestia (n. 518–523), where this is explained. [4] The like is done at the present day. This church, which is called Christian, has at this day come to its end, therefore the arcana of heaven and the church have now been revealed by the Lord, to serve as the doctrine of life and faith for the new church, which is meant by “the New Jerusalem” in Revelation. This doctrine, too, has been taken up into heaven lest harm be done to it by the evil before the establishment of the new church. Such, therefore, is the signification of this respecting the two witnesses, that “they went up into heaven”; also of what follows in the next chapter, where it treats of “the woman about to bring forth a child,” before whom stood the dragon: That the child was caught up to God and to His throne (Rev. 12:5). What is there meant in particular by the “woman” and the “child” will be told in the explanation of the next chapter.

This is evident from the signification of “to behold,” as being to understand, consequently to know and to acknowledge (of which above, n. 11, 37, 260a, 354, 529); also from the signification of “enemies,” as being those who are opposed to the goods of love and the truths of doctrine, consequently those who are in evils and falsities, for these are meant in the Word in its spiritual sense by “enemies and adversaries.” Thence it is clear that “their enemies beheld them” signifies the knowledge and acknowledgment with those who are against “the two witnesses,” that is, against the goods of love and the truths of doctrine. [2] The arcanum here involved is this: “Enemies” here mean those who are inwardly opposed to the goods of love and the truths of doctrine, but still not outwardly; for such with the mouth act like friends, but in heart they are enemies; therefore before the world they profess a belief in goods and truths, but in their spirit, in which they are when they meditate alone with themselves, they reject them. These are the “enemies who behold,” for when such are in corporeal-natural thought, in which they are whenever they are in company with others, they see, that is, know and acknowledge, goods and truths. But when they are in their spiritual-natural thought, in which they are whenever they are alone and are thinking about matters of belief, they do not acknowledge. This is why it is said that “these two witnesses went up into heaven in the cloud”; for the “cloud” signifies the external of the Word, of the church, and of worship, which they see and from which they see. That the “cloud” here signifies this external may be seen in the article just above. [3] In a multitude of passages in the Word, “adversaries” and “enemies” are mentioned, and by them evils and falsities are meant, evils by “adversaries,” and falsities by “enemies”; for the Word in its bosom is spiritual, therefore in that sense no other than spiritual adversaries and enemies can be meant by “adversaries and enemies.” That this is so can be seen from the following passages.

But this cannot be presented to the understanding unless it first be told how things are in the spiritual world; for the things described in this verse, namely, that “there was a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell, and there were killed in the earthquake names of men seven thousand, and the rest became afraid and gave glory to the God of heaven,” are things that take place, and in fact have already taken place at the time when the last judgment was at hand, but in the spiritual world, and not in the natural world; for when the good there are to be separated from the evil, and the good are to be protected from being harmed by the evil, then the good are taken away from the societies and the evil are left, according to the Lord’s words in Matthew: Two [men] shall be in the field, one shall be taken, the other shall be left; two [women] shall be grinding, one shall be taken, the other shall be left (Matt. 24:40, 41). This may be seen explained in Arcana Coelestia (n. 4334, 4335). When the good are taken away there occurs in the societies in which the good and evil had been together, a notable change in respect to the things that pertain to the church. [3] But the cause of this change shall be further disclosed. In the spiritual world there is a communication of all affections, and sometimes of thoughts; and within each society there is a general communication, extending itself from the middle of the society in every direction even to the boundaries, much as light spreads forth from a center to the circumferences. The variations and changes of the affections that arise from this communication and its extension spring from an influx of the affections from other societies, either above or at the sides, also from the newcomers that enter the society, and also from a few or many being taken away from the society. [4] The societies upon which the last judgment came consisted both of the good and of the evil, but of such evil as were interiorly but not exteriorly opposed to the goods of love and the truths of"

For this reason, although they were interiorly evil, yet they could be together with those who were both exteriorly and interiorly good. When, therefore, the good were to be separated from those who merely appeared good in external form, their external good vanished, and their internal evil appeared; for they were held in that external good by communication with those within the same society who were not only exteriorly but also interiorly good, as has been said above. So when external good was taken away from the evil their interiors were opened; and these were full of mere evil and filthy things, which made evident of what quality they were in themselves. Such, then, is what is meant in particular by “the two witnesses going up by command into heaven in the cloud, and their enemies beholding them”; and here that “in that hour there was a great earthquake,” namely, that when that state came a notable change took place in respect to those things that pertain to the church. 675a. And the tenth part of the city fell, signifies that no truths of doctrine any longer existed with those who remained. This is evident from the signification of “ten,” as being all persons and all things, also many persons and many things, and of “the tenth part,” as being all and much (of which presently); also from the signification of “city,” as being doctrine and also the truth of doctrine, for a doctrine, that it may be a doctrine of the church, must consist of truths from the Word (that a “city” signifies doctrine see above, n. 223). It is evident also from the signification of “to fall,” as being to be separated, consequently to have no existence; to be separated and to have no existence is predicated of truths of doctrine when “to fall” is predicated of a city.

[3] For in the spiritual world there is a communication of the affections and thence of the thoughts, and from such communication one is held by another, thus all in the same society mutually, in a like affection and accordingly in a like good; thus are the evil also held by the good. But these evil were such as were able in external form to put on an appearance of sanctity, of piety, of intelligence, of zeal for the church and its doctrine, also in the life an appearance of being just and sincere from the heart, and yet interiorly in themselves they possessed nothing of such good. Such were the evil, with whom there could no longer exist any truths of doctrine, after the good were taken away, who are meant by “the two witnesses” that went up by command into heaven.

(Respecting these societies or that heaven, many things are related in the small work Last Judgment. ) In these societies were such evil persons as have been described, and the good associated with them; and so long as these were conjoined in one society the evil appeared in externals like the good; but when they had been separated, then the external good in them, which was only simulated and hypocritical, was separated, and their interiors were laid open, which were infernal, filled with mere evils and falsities therefrom.

[5] That “ten” signifies all persons and all things, also many persons and many things, can be seen from the passages in the Word where that number occurs. As in Moses: Jehovah hath commanded unto you His covenant which He covenanted36 you to do, the ten words which He wrote upon two tables of stone (Deut. 4:13). Jehovah wrote upon the tables according to the former writing, the ten words which Jehovah spake unto you in the mount out of the midst of the fire (Deut. 10:4). There were “ten words” or “ten commandments” constituting the decalog, because “ten” signifies all things, therefore “the ten words” mean the law in its whole complex. [6] As “ten” signifies all persons: The Lord compared the kingdom of the heavens to ten virgins having lamps with which to go forth to meet the bridegroom, of whom five were prudent and five foolish (Matt. 25:1, 2, et seq.). “The ten virgins” to whom the kingdom of the heavens is likened signify all who are of the church, for “ten” signifies all, and “virgins” the church; but “five” signifies some, or some part, for some of the church were prudent and some foolish. Such is the signification of the number “five” in the Word. “Lamps” signify the knowledges of truth and good, here from the Word, also the truths of doctrine and of faith; “oil” signifies the good of love and of charity; the “bridegroom” means the Lord, and the “wedding” means heaven and the church, which are called a “wedding” from the marriage of good and truth; and as where there is not this marriage there is neither heaven nor the church, therefore those are called “foolish” who know the truths of faith and have no good of love, while those who have the good of love are called “prudent”;"

This is why “the virgin and daughter of Zion,” “the virgin and daughter of Jerusalem,” “the virgin and daughter of Israel” and “of Judah,” are mentioned in so many passages, these everywhere meaning the church. [7] As “ten” signifies all as also many: The Lord said of the nobleman who went into a far country, that he called his ten servants and gave them ten pounds [minas] to trade with; and after they had traded, one said that his pound had gained ten pounds; to him he said, Thou shalt have authority over ten cities; and the second said, Thy pound hath made five pounds; to him he said, Be thou over five cities; and of the third, who laid up his pound in a napkin, and did not trade, he said, Take from him the pound, and give it to him that hath ten pounds (Luke 19:12–14, 16–20, 24). Here, too, the numbers “ten” and “five” are employed because “ten” signifies all persons and all things, and “five” some persons and some things. “The ten servants” whom the nobleman going into a far country called to him, mean all who are in the world, and in particular, all who are of the church; for the “nobleman” means the Lord, and “going into a far country” means the Lord’s departure out of the world and His then seeming to be absent; “the ten pounds that he gave to the ten servants to trade with” signify all the knowledges of truth and good from the Word, with the ability to perceive them; for a “pound” [mina], which was silver and was money, signifies the knowledges of truth and the ability to perceive; and “to trade” signifies by means of these to acquire intelligence and wisdom; those who acquire much are meant by the servant who from a pound gained ten pounds; and those who acquire some are meant by him who from a pound gained five pounds; the “cities which are said to be given them” signify the truths of doctrine, and “to possess them” signifies intelligence and wisdom, and life and happiness therefrom. Thence it is clear what is signified by “ten cities” and by “five cities.” As those who acquire nothing of intelligence are like the “foolish virgins” (of whom just above), and"

Here, too, “five” and “ten” also signify something and much; thus, that the first from some knowledges of truth and good acquired much wisdom. It is taken away from him who has acquired nothing of intelligence and is given to him who has much, because when man after death becomes a spirit he carries with him all things, and every single thing that he has drawn from the Word and from the doctrine of the church. But those who through these have acquired nothing of intelligence are interiorly evil, and therefore misuse the truths and goods of heaven and the church, which they possess in the memory only, in exercising dominion over the simple good who are in the lowest heaven, and in doing evil to them. This is why these truths and goods are taken away from them and are given to those who have many, since these do not misuse them, but from them perform uses. [9] Those who do not acquire spiritual intelligence in the world through the knowledges of truth and good from the Word are evil, as can be seen from this, that all are born into evils of every kind, and these evils are removed only by means of Divine truths from the Word, that is, by applying truths to uses, and thus receiving them in the life.

[10] Because “ten” signifies all and much, therefore that number is used by the Lord also in other passages, where all and much must be understood. As in Luke: Of the woman having ten drach mas, if she lose one, doth she not light a candle and sweep the house and seek carefully till she find it? (Luke 15:8) “Ten” here signifies much. This is said of a “woman,” and that “she would light a candle and sweep the house” because of the spiritual sense in every particular of the Word. In that sense a “woman” signifies the church in respect to the affection of truth, thus also the affection of truth itself which belongs to the church; the “drachma” signifies truth; “to lose the drachma” signifies to lose one of the truths or the knowledges of truth; “to light a candle” signifies self- examination from affection; “to sweep the house” signifies to traverse the whole mind and to examine every particular where the truth lies hidden. This is the spiritual sense of these words. “A hundred” has the same signification as “ten,” namely, much; therefore a similar parable speaks of: A hundred sheep, if one is lost (Matt. 18:12, 13; Luke 15:3–7). 11] “Ten” signifies all and much also in the following passages. In Isaiah: Many houses great and fair37 shall become a waste without inhabitant; for ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath (Isa. 5:9, 10). This is said of the desolation of truth with those who are of the church. “Many houses which shall become a waste” signify the men"

[12] In Moses: If ye will go contrary to Me I will break for you the staff of bread, that ten women may bake your bread in one oven, and I will bring back your bread by weight (Lev. 26:23, 26). “To break the staff of bread” signifies to deprive of spiritual food, and thus of spiritual nourishment, for “bread” means everything that nourishes the soul, and in particular the good of love; therefore “ten women shall bake your bread in one oven” signifies that in all things of the church with man there is so little of good and truth as to be scarcely anything; “ten women” signify all things of the church; “bread” signifies good and truth that nourish the soul; and “oven” signifies where spiritual food is prepared, thus the man with whom it is; “to bring back the bread by weight” signifies the lack and want of such things as spiritually nourish.

This is said of the calling together of the Gentiles and their admission to the church by the Lord; and “ten men out of all tongues” signify all from whatever religion, namely those “who come to seek Jehovah of Hosts in Jerusalem,” that is, who wish to be admitted to the church and to confess the Lord, therefore “ten"

But this with the rest of the passage may be seen explained above (n. 433d), where it is shown that “Jerusalem” does not mean Jerusalem, nor “Jew” any Jew. [14] In Amos: Jehovah said, I hate the pride of Jacob and his palaces; therefore I will shut up the city and the fullness thereof; if there remain ten men in one house they shall die (Amos 6:8, 9). “The pride of Jacob and his palaces which Jehovah hates,” signify the love of falsity and belief in it with those who are of the church, “pride” meaning the love of falsity, and “palaces” the falsities themselves, which are called “palaces” because they belong to the proud, and because the falsities of such are embellished in external form so as to appear magnificent, although they are most vile, like huts full of rubbish and filth; “to shut up the city and the fullness thereof” signifies to condemn the doctrine, because it is full of the falsities of evil, and is possessed by them, “city” meaning doctrine, and “fullness” the falsities of evil; therefore “if there remain ten men in one house they shall die” signifies that all the truths of good with everyone shall perish, “ten men” meaning all truths, “house” man in respect to good, and “to die” to perish. [15] In Zechariah: The prophet saw a flying roll, the length thereof twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof ten cubits; this is the malediction that goeth forth over the faces of the whole land (Zech. 5:2, 3). “The flying roll,” which meant “the malediction that goeth forth over the faces of the whole land,” was twenty cubits in length and ten in breadth because “twenty” and “ten” signify all, here all good changed into evil and all truth into falsity; “twenty” is predicated of good and everything of it, and “ten” of truth and everything of it; moreover, “length” also signifies good, and “breadth” truth (see above, n. 355e, 627a, 629a, and in the work Heaven and Hell, n. 197)."

In Daniel: The fourth beast coming up out of the sea had ten horns; as to the ten horns out of this kingdom shall ten kings arise (Dan. 7:7, 20, 24). “The ten horns” of the beast here signify the highest power of falsity against truth; “ten kings” signify falsities in the whole complex, and “kingdom” signifies that church perverted.

What is signified there in particular will be seen in the explanations further on. 675c. [18] As “ten” signifies all persons and all things, it follows that “the tenth part” signifies everything. It is from this that “tenths” and “tithings” derived their origin, and these signified that everything was holy and blessed when the tenth part of the threshing floor and of the wine press, or of the corn and wine, was given to the Levites; likewise for the Levites when the tenth part was again tithed and given to Aaron. Of these it is thus written in the Word: Tithing thou shalt tithe all the increase of thy seed that is brought forth in the field year by year (Deut. 14:22). Say unto the Levites, that the tenths must be given to them for an inheritance, and that they must offer up a heave offering of them to Jehovah, a tenth of the tenths, and this from the corn of the threshing floor and from the fullness of the wine vat; and the tenth of the tenth they must give to Aaron the priest (Num. 18:24–28). 19] That the “tenth” signified a blessing in all things, thus that everything was holy and blessed, is evident in Malachi: Bring ye all the tithes to the house of treasure, that there may be food in My house; then prove ye Me in this, if I will not open you the windows of heaven and pour you out a blessing until there be no room for more (Mal. 3:10). “To open the windows and pour out a blessing” signifies the inflowing Divine from which is intelligence and life eternal; the like as is signified by “rain” above (n. 644); and this also is properly meant by the “blessing” that would be given if the tithes were brought; so “tithes” here signify that everything was thus blest."

Jacob likewise promised and vowed: That if he returned in peace unto his father’s house everything that Jehovah gave him tithing should be tithed (Gen. 28:21, 22). From these passages, as well as others, it can be seen what is signified in the Word by “ten” and “the tenth part.” [20] The reason that “ten” signifies all things is derived from heaven itself; for heaven in the whole and every part answers to a man, and is therefore called the greatest man. All the forces of life of this greatest man or heaven close in the two hands and the two feet, and the hands close in ten fingers, and the feet in ten toes; for this reason, all things of man in respect to power and support are lastly gathered into ten fingers and toes, so these signify all things of man; moreover, ultimates signify in the Word all. 676.

From this it can be seen that “there were killed in the earthquake names of men seven thousand” signifies that in that change of state all truths of good perished, and thus all things of heaven and the church. [2] That “the names of men” signify the truths of good and the consequent understanding of truth can be seen from the signification of “name,” as being the quality of a thing or state with man; and from the signification of “man,” as being intelligence, thus also the understanding of truth. “Name” signifies the quality of a thing or state with man because in the spiritual world there are no names of persons as in the natural world. In the spiritual world all are named according to the quality of their life, thus with a difference within societies and out of them. Within the societies the quality of each one’s state of life is constant, for each one there dwells in a quarter and also at a distance from the center according to the quality of his affection and of his intelligence; therefore his name is in accord with this quality. When, therefore, the name of anyone in a society is heard his quality is also recognized. This is why “name” signifies in the spiritual sense the quality of a thing and of a state of life. But outside of societies this naming according to one’s state of life is not constant; for before a man-spirit enters into any society he passes through many states in order that he may put off the things that disagree with his ruling love and put on such as agree with it, and yet everyone is named according to the state in which he is, and also according to the idea and perception of what his state is. That names in the spiritual world are uttered spiritually may be seen above (n. 102a); therefore “name” signifies in the Word what the state of the life is (n. 148). So, too, “the name of Jehovah” and “the name of the Lord” signify all things by which He is worshipped, thus all things of love and faith (n. 102, 135); and “man” signifies in the Word the spiritual affection of truth, and thence the understanding of truth (n. 280, 546). From this it is clear what “the names of men” signify.

For when from those who are merely natural the truths of good that resided in their externals are taken away, they are not disturbed by the influx of falsities and evils from hell, still less do they turn away; for their proper thought and will, which has been interiorly concealed with them, consists of mere falsities and evils therefrom and of evils and falsities therefrom; and when they are in these they are enraged against truths and goods, and thence are eager to destroy them. This is why the evil, when they are no longer in externals, are not afraid of evils and falsities, or even of hell, for these belong to their love, consequently to the delights of their life.

[4] In the Word “to become afraid,” “to be dismayed,” and like expressions are often used in reference both to the good and to the evil, and “terror” and “dismay” signify a state of the mind disturbed and changed by an imminent or visible danger to the life; but this is one thing with the good and another with the evil; with the good it is a disturbance of mind and a change of state from imminent and visible danger to the soul, but with the evil it is from imminent and visible danger to the life of the body. This is because the good regard the life of the soul and not so much the life of the body as the chief and final thing, while the evil regard the life of the body and not so much the life of the soul as the chief and final thing; in fact, the evil do not in heart believe in that life, and such as do believe still love only the things that are of the body, such as the appetites and pleasures of various kinds. But with the good the reverse is true. [5] To make clear that “to become afraid,” “to be dismayed,” “to dread,” and the like, signify to be disturbed in mind from a change"

In David: My heart is agitated in the midst of me, and the terrors of death have fallen upon me; fear and trembling are come upon me, and horror hath covered me (Ps. 55:4, 5). This is said of temptations, in which evils and falsities break in from hell and inspire terror in regard to damnation; for as has been said above, the good become afraid and tremble on account of imminent dangers to the soul, thus from the invasion of evils into the thoughts and intentions of the will. Thus there are various disturbances of mind that in particular are signified by “agitation of heart,” “terrors of death,” “fear,” “trembling,” and “horror,” which are here mentioned according to the order of their succession. [6] In Isaiah: The islands came39 and feared, the ends of the earth were agitated, they drew near and came (Isa. 41:5). This is said of the Lord’s coming; and “the islands and ends of the earth” mean the Gentiles that are remote from the truths of the church; and their “fear and agitation” signify disturbances of mind from fear of being destroyed. [7] In Ezekiel: All hands are relaxed, and all knees go into waters, whence they shall gird themselves with sackcloth, terror shall cover them, and upon all faces there shall be shame; they shall cast their silver into the streets, and their gold shall be an abomination (Ezek. 7:17–19). This, too, treats of the Lord’s coming, and these things are said of it; the various disturbances of the mind from grief on account of evils and from joy on account of goods are described by various expressions of fear and grief, as that “the hands are relaxed,” “the knees go into waters,” “terror shall cover them,” and “upon all faces"

[8] The holy tremor that seizes upon, agitates, and convulses the inner parts of the head, when the Divine flows in and fills them is called “fear,” “terror,” “dread,” as can be seen from the following passages. In Luke: When Zacharias saw the angel he was troubled, and fear fell upon him; the angel therefore said to him, Fear not, Zacharias (Luke 1:12, 13). Likewise when the virgin Mary saw the angel (Luke 1:29, 30). When the angel of the Lord stood by the shepherds, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them, they were afraid with a great fear; but the angel said to them, Be not afraid; behold, I proclaim unto you good tidings of great joy, which is40 to all the people (Luke 2:9, 10). When Jesus was transfigured and was seen in glory, it is said that Peter, James, and John feared when they entered into the cloud (Luke 9:34). And when they heard the voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son, they fell upon their faces and feared exceedingly; but Jesus drawing near touched them, saying, Arise, be not afraid (Matt. 17:5–7; Mark 9:6). When the Lord healed the palsied man, it is said that fear took hold on all, and they glorified God; and they were filled with fear, saying, We have seen wonderful things today (Luke 5:26). And when the Lord raised to life the dead young man of Nain, it is said that fear took hold on all, and they praised God (Luke 7:16)."

And when the women departed from the tomb they were seized with fear, trembling, and amazement, and at the same time with great joy; and they told no one, for they were afraid; therefore Jesus said to them, Fear not; tell the brethren (Matt. 28:8, 10; Mark 16:8). The two disciples going to Emmaus said to Jesus, Certain women terrified us (Luke 24:22). From these passages it can be concluded that “terror” and “alarm” mean in the Word various disturbances of mind arising from the influx of such things as cause amazement, connected also with joy. [9] Again, “terror” signifies in the spiritual sense terror on account of evils and falsities that are from hell, for these terrify the spiritual man, because they are the opposites of the goods and truths, which the spiritual man loves and the loss of which he fears. In this sense “terror” is mentioned in many passages of the Word. Thus in Isaiah: About the time of evening behold terror; before the morning it is not (Isa. 17:14). “Evening” signifies the last time of the church, when there are mere evils and falsities; these are called “terror” because they are hell. But the “morning” signifies the first time of the church, when there are no evils and falsities, therefore it is said, “before the morning the terror is not.” [10] In Jeremiah: Fear thou not, my servant Jacob, and be not terrified, O Israel, for behold, I save thee from afar; Jacob shall be tranquil and quiet, none shall make him afraid (30:9, 10)."

It is similar in many other passages. But what is signified by “fearing God” in the spiritual sense will be told in the explanation of the eighteenth verse of this chapter. 678.

This is evident from the signification of “giving glory” or of “glorifying,” as being to acknowledge and worship (of which presently); also from the signification of “the God of heaven,” as being the Lord. That the Lord is the God of heaven He Himself made clear when He was in the world and when He departed out of the world. When He was in the world He said in John: The Father hath given all things into the hand of the Son (John 3:35). The Father hath given to the Son power over all flesh (John 17:2). And in Matthew: All things have been delivered unto Me by the Father (Matt. 11:27). And when He departed out of the world He said to the disciples: All power hath been given unto Me in heaven and on earth (Matt. 28:18). From this it is clear that the Lord is the God of heaven.

From this it follows that “to give glory” and “to glorify,” in reference to God, mean to worship and to adore Him. In reference to the Lord, “glory” properly signifies in the Word the Divine truth proceeding from Him, for the reason that this Divine truth is the light of heaven, and from that light angels and men have not only all their intelligence and wisdom, but also all their happiness, and besides this, all magnificence in the heavens, which is ineffable; these, therefore, are what are properly signified by “the glory of God”; and because Divine truth is glory it follows that “the glory of the Lord” means to enlighten angels and men, and to bestow intelligence and wisdom, and to bless with felicities and delights, and also to make magnificent all things in the heavens, and that this glory is not from the love of glory, but from love towards the human race. This is why the Lord says in John: Herein is My Father glorified that ye may bear much fruit, and may become My disciples (John 15:8); The words which Thou hast given Me I have given unto them, and I am glorified in them (John 17:8, 10). ] That this is the glory of the Lord can be seen from this, that the light of heaven, from which is all wisdom, beauty, and magnificence in the heavens, proceeds from the Lord as a sun, and it is the Lord’s Divine love that appears to the angels as a sun. From this it is clear that the light of heaven, which in its essence is Divine truth and Divine wisdom, is the Divine love proceeding; and as love desires nothing else than to give that which is its own to another, thus to fill others with blessedness, what will not the Divine love do? Nevertheless, the Lord cannot give His glory to anyone and fill him with wisdom and blessedness unless he acknowledges and worships the Lord, for it is by this that man conjoins himself to the Lord by love and faith; for in order that acknowledgment and worship may be acknowledgment and worship, it must be from love and faith; and without conjunction by means of these no good can flow in from the Lord, because it is"

That the Lord’s glorification is from the Lord Himself, and that with men and angels it is the reception and acknowledgment that every good and truth and everything of salvation and life is from the Lord, may also be seen above (n. 288a). 679.

Verse 14. The second woe is past; behold the third woe cometh quickly, signifies a lamentation over the final vastation of the church, now certainly at hand. This is evident from the signification of “woe” as being lamentation over various things, especially over such things as devastate the church (of which above, n. 531). And as “three” signifies what is complete, therefore the “third woe” signifies the final lamentation, when the devastation is full. That “three” signifies what is complete, and thus the end, may be seen above (n. 435a, 506, 532). This is evident also from the"

What this third woe that was to come quickly involves, can be seen from what follows, namely, that it involves the final state of the church, when there is no longer any truth or good, and the state of separation at that time of the evil from the good, and of the good from the evil, and at length the last judgment, which is effected by a full separation, and then the casting down of the evil into hell, and the elevation of the good into heaven. 681. Verse 15. And the seventh angel sounded, signifies the influx of Divine truth through the heavens from the Lord, and the consequent final changes. This is evident from the signification of “sounding,” in reference to an angel, as being the influx of Divine truth from the Lord, and a consequent change in the lower places, where the evil are (see above, n. 489, 502). This is the reason of this signification of “to sound,” because “trumpet” and “horn” signify Divine truth about to be revealed or that has been revealed (see above, n. 55, 262). The “sounding of the seventh angel” means the final change caused by the influx of Divine truth from the Lord, because the number “seven” signifies what is full and final (see above, n. 20, 24, 257, 300, 486). As the changes in the lower places where the evil are, which are effected by a stronger or milder influx of Divine truth through the heavens from the Lord, thus by various kinds of influx, have been fully treated of above (n. 413a, 418a, 419a, 426, 489, 493), it is unnecessary to say anything further about them. That the separation of the evil from the good, and the casting down of the evil into hell, and many other changes were effected by these various kinds of influx can be seen in the places indicated. From this now it is evident what is signified by “the seven angels sounding.” 682. And there were great voices in the heavens, signifies enlightenment and joy in the higher heavens.

The higher heavens are meant because through them and from them influxes descend into the lower parts, and by these the evil, who have been conjoined in externals to those in the lower heavens, are separated. So long as this conjunction continued there could be no enlightenment or joy, but so far as the separation was effected there was enlightenment and joy. Thence it is that the higher heavens are meant; since there is such a con nection between higher things and lower things, in the spiritual world, that so far as lower things are in order, the higher are also. For lower things there are like the lower parts of a house and its foundations; so far, therefore, as these are unimpaired the higher parts are stable, secure, and complete, not swaying or tottering or gaping open. Or they are like the exterior things in man, as the organs of sight, taste, hearing, and touch, in that so far as these are unharmed their interiors see, taste, and hear clearly, and the touch is sensitive; for it is the interior things which sensate in the exterior, and the exterior sensate nothing of themselves. It is similar in the heavens; the higher heavens close into and rest upon the lower, and there is therefore between them an unbroken bond like that between things prior and posterior, or between causes and effects; if the effect does not altogether correspond to its cause, that is, if it does not have formed in itself everything that is in the effecting cause, which relates to the forces and the endeavor to act, the cause is weakened and acts imperfectly, for all things of the cause are inscribed on the effect, therefore it is the cause alone that acts, and no effect separate from a cause.

That the Lord is called “Lord” from Divine good, and “Christ” from Divine truth, will be seen below.

It is through these that the Lord reigns, consequently these are strictly the Lord’s kingdom with those who receive them; for when these reign with angels and men then the Lord Himself reigns, for the things that proceed from Him are Himself. The Lord in heaven is no other than the Divine proceeding. [3] The Lord indeed not only rules those that receive Divine celestial and spiritual things from Him, but also those that do not receive, as all who are in hell; still it cannot be said that the Lord’s kingdom is in hell, since those there are altogether unwilling to be ruled by the Divine that proceeds and according to the laws of its order; they even deny the Lord and turn themselves away from Him; yet the Lord does rule them, not like subjects and citizens of"

[5] And elsewhere: Seek ye first the kingdom of the heavens41 and His righteousness and all things shall be added to you (Matt. 6:33). “The kingdom of the heavens” means in the spiritual sense Divine truth, and “righteousness” Divine good, therefore it is said, “Seek ye first the kingdom of the heavens and His righteousness.” But in the highest sense “the kingdom of the heavens” means the Lord, since He is the all of His kingdom, and in the same sense “righteousness” signifies the Lord’s merit. And as a man who is ruled by the Lord desires and loves only such things as are of the Lord, he is, unknown to himself, forever led to felicities; and this is why it is said that “all things shall be added to him,” meaning that all things that tend to his salvation shall come to pass according to his desire.

It is evident that those who receive Divine truth are meant by “the sons of the kingdom,” for it is said, “the seed are the sons of the kingdom, and the tares are the sons of the evil one,” “seed” meaning Divine truth, and “tares” infernal falsity; such are called “sons” because in the spiritual sense of the Word “sons” signify truths, and in the contrary sense falsities (see above, n. 166). [7] Moreover, “the kingdom of God” signifies the church in respect to truths from good, and also heaven (as may be seen above, n. 48); and “the kingdom of God” with man signifies to be in truths from good from the Lord, thus in wisdom, and consequently in the power to resist falsities and evils, therefore “to reign” belongs to the Lord alone (see also above, n. 333). 684a. It is said the “kingdoms of the world are become our Lord’s and His Christ’s,” and this signifies that Divine good and Divine truth are received when the evil are separated from the good and are cast into hell; for then both the higher and the lower heavens can be in enlightenment and thus in the perception of good and truth; and this could not be effected so long as the evil were conjoined with the good, because the interiors of the angels, who are in the lower heavens, could not then be opened, but only the exteriors, and the Lord does not reign in spirits and men in externals separate from internals, but in internals, and from internals in externals; for this reason, until the interiors of the angels of the lowest heaven, which are spiritual and celestial, were opened, that heaven did not become the kingdom of the Lord as it did after the separation of the evil from them. [2] It is said that “the kingdoms of the world are become our Lord’s and His Christ’s,” and “Lord” here has the same meaning as “Jehovah” in the Old Testament, and “Father” in the New, namely, the Lord in respect to the Divine Itself and in respect to"

So “the Anointed of Jehovah” has a similar meaning, for the Divine Itself which is called “Jehovah” and “Father,” and in its essence was the Divine good of Divine love, anointed the Divine Human, which is called “the Son of God,” and which in its essence while it was in the world was Divine truth; for “anointing” signified that the Lord’s Divine Human proceeded from His Divine Itself, and consequently the Divine truth from His Divine good. [3] From this it is clear that the Lord alone in relation to the Divine Human was essentially “the Anointed of Jehovah,” while kings and priests were called “the anointed of Jehovah” representatively; for the “oil” with which the anointing was performed signified the Divine good of the Divine love.

The woman of Samaria said, I know that Messiah cometh, who is called Christ (John 4:25). This shows that the Lord is called “Christ” because He was the Messiah whose coming was foretold in the Word of the Old Testament; for the word for Anointed is “Christ” in the Greek, and “Messiah” in the Hebrew, and a king is one anointed.

Also in John: Nathaniel said, Thou art the Son of God, the King of Israel (John 1:48). [5] As “Anointed,” “Christ,” “Messiah,” and “King,” are synonymous terms, so also “Son of God”; and each one of these names signifies in the spiritual sense Divine truth (that this is the signification of “king” may be seen above, n. 31, 553, 625); and “Son of God” also has the same meaning, because in the Word “sons” signify truths, and thus “the Son of God” signifies Divine truth. That “sons” signify truths may be seen above (n. 166). “Christ” and “Messiah” have a like signification. [6] That “Christ” signifies Divine truth is evident in Matthew: Be not ye called Rabbi, one is your teacher, Christ (Matt. 23:8). “Rabbi” and “teacher” signify one that teaches truth, thus in an abstract sense the doctrine of truth, and in the highest sense Divine truth, which is Christ.

This is why kings, when they had been anointed, represented the Lord, and were called “the anointed of Jehovah”; yet it was the Lord alone in relation to His Divine Human that was “the Anointed of Jehovah,” since the Divine good of Divine love was in Him, and this was Jehovah and the Father from whom the Lord had the being [esse] of life. For it is well known that He was conceived of Jehovah, thus it was from the Divine good of Divine love, which was in Him from conception, that the Lord in relation to His Human was Divine truth so long as He was in the world. This shows that the Lord alone was “the Anointed of Jehovah” essentially, and that kings were called “the anointed of Jehovah” representatively. Thence now it is that the Lord in relation to His Divine Human was called “Messiah” and “Christ,” that is, “Anointed.” 684b. [9] This can also be seen from the following passages. In Isaiah: The spirit of the Lord Jehovih is upon Me, therefore Jehovah hath anointed Me to proclaim good tidings unto the poor, He hath sent Me to bind up the broken in heart, to preach liberty to the captives, to the"

This is plainly said of the Lord. The meaning is that the Lord Jehovih anointed His Divine Human “to proclaim good tidings unto the poor, and sent it to bind up the broken in heart,” and so on, for all this the Lord accomplished from His Human (but the particulars may be seen explained above, n. 183b, 375e [5], 612). [10] In David: Why have the nations become tumultuous, and why have the peoples meditated vanity? The kings of the earth set themselves and the rulers took counsel together against Jehovah and against His Anointed. I have anointed My king upon Zion, the mountain of My holiness. I will declare the statute, Jehovah said unto me, Thou art My Son, this day have I begotten Thee; ask of Me and I will give the nations for Thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for Thy possession. Kiss the Son, lest He be angry and ye perish in the way, for His anger will shortly burn forth; blessed are all they that put their trust in Him (Ps. 2:1, 2, 6–8, 12). Evidently “the Anointed of Jehovah” means here the Lord in relation to the Divine Human, for it is said, “Jehovah said unto Me, Thou art My Son, this day have I begotten Thee; kiss the Son lest ye perish; blessed are all they that put their trust in Him.” In the sense of the letter this indeed is said of David, but in the Word “David” means the Lord in relation to Divine truth, or as a King (see above, n. 205). It is evident also that the Lord’s coming and finally the last judgment by Him, and afterwards His sovereignty over all things of the world, are here treated of. [11] The spiritual things that lie hidden and are signified in the particulars of this passage are as follows: “The nations have become tumultuous and the peoples have meditated vanity,” signifies the state of the church and of the former heaven that was to pass away, “nations” meaning those who are in evils, and “peoples” those who are in falsities (see above, n. 175, 331b, 625); “the kings of the earth set them selves, and the rulers took counsel together, against Jehovah and against His Anointed,” signifies the falsities of the"

[12] “I have anointed My king upon Zion, the mountain of My holiness,” signifies the Lord’s Human in relation to Divine truth proceeding from the Divine good of His Divine love, and thus His sovereignty over all things of heaven and the church, “Zion” and “the mountain of holiness” meaning heaven and the church; and thus all things of heaven and the church; “I will declare the statute” signifies an arcanum of the Divine providence and will; “Jehovah said unto Me, Thou art My Son, this day have I begotten Thee,” signifies the Lord as the Anointed, Messiah, Christ, and King, thus in relation to His Human conceived and afterwards born of the Divine Itself, that is, Jehovah; “this day” signifies what is decreed from eternity and looks therefrom to the conjunction and union accomplished in time. [13] “Ask of Me, and I will give the nations for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for Thy possession,” signifies His kingdom and dominion over all things of heaven and the church, which shall be His; “kiss the Son” signifies conjunction with the Lord by love, “to kiss” signifying conjunction by love; “lest He be angry, and ye perish in the way,” signifies lest evils assault you and you be condemned, for “to be angry” when predicated of the Lord, signifies the turning away of men from Him, thus their anger and not the Lord’s; and evils are what turn away, and then are angry; “for His anger will shortly burn forth” signifies the last judgment, and the casting down of the evil into hell; “blessed are all they that trust in Him” signifies salvation by love to the Lord and faith in Him.

Kings’ daughters are among thy precious ones; on thy right hand standeth the queen in the best gold of Ophir (Ps. 45:2–9). It is clear from all the particulars in this psalm that this is said of the Lord, and consequently that He it is of whom it is said “God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of joy, with myrrh, aloes, and cassia, and all thy garments.” What this signifies can be seen from the series as follows, namely, that He has Divine wisdom and that from Him is the doctrine of Divine truth, is signified by “thou art fairer than the sons of men, grace is poured upon thy lips,” “fair” signifies wisdom, “the sons of men” signify those who are intelligent in Divine truths, and “lips” signify doctrinals. [15] The Lord’s omnipotence from Divine truth proceeding from Divine good, and the consequent destruction of falsities and evils and the subjugation of the hells, is signified by “gird about the sword upon the thigh, O Mighty One, in majesty and in honor, and in thy honor mount, ride upon the word of truth; thy right hand shall teach thee in wonderful things, thine arrows are sharp, the peoples shall fall under thee, enemies of the king from the heart”; “sword” signifies truth combating against falsity and destroying it; “chariot,” like as “the word of truth,” signifies the doctrine of truth; “to ride” signifies to instruct and combat; “right hand” signifies omnipotence; “arrows” signify truths combating; “peoples” those who are in the falsities of evil; and “enemies of the king” those who are opposed to truths, thus the hells.

[17] Divine truths united to Divine goods are signified by “He hath anointed with myrrh, and aloes, and cassia all thy garments,” “myrrh” signifying good of the lowest degree, “aloes” good of the second degree, and “cassia” good of the third degree, like as these three spices when mixed with olive oil, out of which the “oil of holiness” for anointing was made (Exod. 30:23, 24); and that “oil” signified the Divine good of the Divine love, and the “garments” that were anointed signified Divine truths. [18] That those who are of His kingdom have the spiritual affection of truth is signified by “kings’ daughters are among thy precious ones,” “kings’ daughters” meaning the spiritual affections of truth, which are called “precious” when truths are genuine. That heaven and the church are under His protection and are conjoined to Him, because they are in love to Him from Him, is signified by “on thy right hand standeth the queen in the best gold of Ophir,” “queen” signifying heaven and the church, “at the right hand” signifying under the Lord’s protection from conjunction with Him, and “the best gold of Ophir” the good of love to the Lord. 684c.

Once have I sworn by My holiness, I will not deal falsely with David, his seed shall be to eternity, and his throne as the sun before Me, it shall be established as the moon to eternity, a faithful witness in the clouds (Ps. 89:3, 4, 19–21, 23, 25–29, 35–37). That by “David” here David is not meant, but the Lord as to His kingship, which is the Divine spiritual, and is called the Divine truth, is very evident from what is here said of David, namely, that “his seed and throne shall be as the days of the heavens, and as the sun and the moon to eternity,” that “he shall set the hand in the sea, and his right hand in the rivers,” and that “he shall call Jehovah his Father, and shall be the firstborn, high above the kings of the earth,” with other things that could not be said of David, his sons and his throne. That “David” in the Word means the Lord may be seen above (n. 205).

[25] In the same: O Jehovah, remember David, all his labor; who sware unto Jehovah, and vowed unto the Mighty One of Jacob, Surely I will not enter within the tent of my house, nor go up upon the couch of my bed, until I find out a place for Jehovah, habitations for the Mighty One of Jacob. Lo, we have heard of Him in Ephrathah, we have found Him in the fields of the forest. We will go into His habitations, we will bow ourselves down at His footstool. Arise, O Jehovah, to Thy rest, Thou and the ark of Thy strength. Let Thy priests be clothed with righteousness, and let Thy saints shout for joy; for Thy servant David’s sake turn not back the face of Thine anointed. In Zion will I make the horn of David to bud; I will set in order a lamp for Mine anointed; his adversaries will I clothe with shame, but upon himself shall his crown flourish (Ps. 132:1–3, 5–10, 17, 18). Here, too, “David” and “Anointed or Christ” do not mean David, but the Lord in relation to the Divine Human, for it is said that “His habitations,” that is, of the Mighty One of Jacob, “are found in Ephrathah,” which is Bethlehem, and that they “would bow themselves down at His footstool”; but that this is so will be more evident in the explanation of the particulars in their order.

[30] From the passages here cited from the Word it can be seen that the Lord is called “the Anointed,” that is, the Messiah or the Christ, from the union of Divine good with Divine truth in His Human, for the Lord’s Human from that union is meant by “the Anointed of Jehovah.” [31] Likewise in the first book of Samuel: Jehovah will judge the ends of the earth, and will give strength unto His King and exalt the horn of His Anointed (1 Sam. 2:10). This is a part of the prophetic song of Hannah, the mother of Samuel, before there was any king or anointed over Israel, therefore “King” and “Anointed” here mean the Lord, to whom “is given strength” and whose “horn is exalted” when the Divine is united to the Human, “strength” signifying the power of good over evil, and “horn” the power of truth over falsity, and truth is said “to be exalted” when it becomes interior, and in the same degree becomes more powerful. [32] “The anointed” has a similar meaning in Lamentations: The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of Jehovah, was taken in their pits, of whom we had said, Under his shadow we shall live among the nations (Lam. 4:20). “The anointed of Jehovah” here means in the sense of the letter a king who was made captive, but in the spiritual sense it means the Lord, therefore it is said, “the breath of our nostrils,” that is, the life of the perception of good and truth; “taken in the pits” signifies"

And because this was represented by the anointing of Aaron and his sons, therefore: The holy things of the sons of Israel which belonged to Jehovah Himself were given to Aaron and His sons for the anointing (Num. 18:8). These holy things belonging to Jehovah which were given to Aaron and his sons are enumerated from verses 9 to 19 of that chapter. But see what has been said before, n. 375e (4), (5), respecting “anointings,” namely, that the Lord alone, in relation to the Divine Human, was “the Anointed of Jehovah” because in Him was the Divine good of the Divine love, which was signified by “oil,” and that all others anointed with oil were only representatives of Him. This has been said of “the Anointed of Jehovah,” since “the Anointed of Jehovah” is the Christ, that it may be known that by “the Lord and His Christ” in this passage of Revelation two are not meant but one, that is, that they are one, as are “the Anointed of Jehovah” and “the Lord’s Christ” in Luke 2:26."

[34] Since the Lord is here treated of, to show why He was called “the Christ,” that is, Messiah or Anointed, it is important to explain what is said of the Messiah in Daniel: Seventy weeks are decreed upon thy people and upon thy city of holiness, to consummate the transgression, and to seal up sins, and to expiate iniquity, and to bring in the righteousness of the ages, and to seal up vision and prophecy, and to anoint the Holy of Holies. Know, therefore, and perceive that from the going forth of the Word even to the restoration and building of Jerusalem, even to Messiah the prince, shall be seven weeks. After sixty and two weeks it shall be restored and built with street and moat, but in straitness of times. But after sixty and two weeks the Messiah shall be cut off, yet not for Himself. Then the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary, so that its end shall be with an inundation, and even unto the end of the war desolations are determined. Yet He shall confirm a covenant with many for one week; but in the midst of the week He shall cause the sacrifice and meal offering to cease. At last upon the bird of abominations shall be desolation, and even to the consummation and decision it shall drop upon the devastation (Dan. 9:24–27). The meaning of these words has been investigated and explained by many of the learned, but in the literal sense only, and not as yet in the spiritual sense, for that sense has been hitherto unknown in the Christian world. In that sense these words have the following signification: “Seventy weeks are decreed upon thy people” signifies the time and state of the church that then existed with the Jews, even to its end, “seven” and “seventy” signifying fullness from beginning to end, and “people” those who were then of the church; “and upon thy city of holiness” signifies the time and state of the end of the church in respect to the doctrine of truth from the Word, “city” signifying the doctrine of truth, and “the city of holiness” Divine truth, which is the Word. [35] “To consummate the transgression and to seal up the sins and to expiate iniquity” signifies when there are nothing but falsities and evils in the church, thus when iniquity is fulfilled and consummated; for until this is done the end does not come, for reasons given in the small work Last Judgment; for if the end should come before, the simple good, who are conjoined as to externals with those who imitate and hypocritically make a show of truths and goods in externals, would be destroyed; therefore it is added"

For that chapter treats of the consummation of the age, thus of the successive vastation of the Christian church, therefore the devastation of that church is meant by these words in Daniel. (But what they signify in the spiritual sense has been explained in Arcana Coelestia, n. 3652.) From this it can now be seen what is signified by “the kingdoms of the world are become the Lord’s and His Christ’s,” also what is signified by “the Lord’s Christ” (or the Christ of the Lord), in Luke: A promise was made to Simeon by the Holy Spirit, that he should not see death before he had seen the Christ of the Lord (Luke 2:26). 685. And he shall reign unto the ages of the ages, signifies His dominion by means of Divine truth to eternity. This is evident from the signification of “to reign,” as being in reference to the Lord to have dominion by means of Divine truth (of which presently); also from the signification of “unto the ages of the ages,” as being to eternity. “Unto the ages of the ages” means to eternity because the sense of the letter of the Word is natural, and to it the spiritual sense corresponds. The natural sense of the Word consists of such things as are in nature, which in general have reference to times and spaces and to places and persons, and “the ages of the ages” belong to times to which eternity corresponds in the spiritual"

[2] “To reign” signifies in reference to the Lord to have dominion by means of Divine truth, because dominion is predicated of good, and to reign of truth, for the Lord is called “Lord” [Dominus] from Divine good, and “king” from Divine truth. This is why here and there in the Word, both terms, dominion and kingdom, or to have dominion and to reign, are used, as in the following passages. In Micah: Thou, O hill of the daughter of Zion, unto thee shall come and shall return the former dominion, the kingdom of the daughter of Jerusalem (Mic. 4:8). Because “the daughter of Zion” signifies the celestial church, the essential of which is the good of love, “dominion” is predicated of it, while “kingdom” is predicated of “the daughter of Jerusalem” because that signifies the spiritual church, the essential of which is the truth of doctrine. [3] In David: Thy kingdom is a kingdom of all the ages, and thy dominion to every generation and generation (Ps. 145:13). In Daniel: To the Son of man there was given dominion, glory, and a kingdom. His dominion is a dominion of an age, and His kingdom that which shall not be destroyed (Dan. 7:14). The kingdom and the dominion and the majesty of kingdoms shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High (Dan. 7:27). In these passages “dominion” is predicated of good, because from good the Lord is called “Lord,” and “kingdom” is predicated of truth, because from truth the Lord is called “King,” as in Revelation:"

The like is true as applied to men, in David: The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers consulted together (Ps. 2:2). From this it can be seen what is signified in particular by “reigning unto the ages of the ages.” That “kingdom” signifies heaven and the church in respect to the truth of doctrine may be seen above (n. 48); therefore “to reign” belongs to the Lord alone, and when it is said of men it means to be in truths from good from the Lord, and to have power therefrom to resist the falsities from evil (n. 333). 686.

And the twenty-four elders who sit before God upon their thrones, signifies the higher heavens in light and power from the Lord to separate the evil from the good before the day of the last judgment which is to come shortly. This is evident from the signification of “the twenty-four elders,” as being the higher heaven (see above, n. 322, 362, 462); and also from the signification of “to sit upon thrones,” that it is to be in the work of judging, for “thrones” signify the heavens, and “to sit upon thrones” signifies to judge. Since the angels of heaven do not judge, but the Lord alone, and since the Lord arranges those heavens by His influx and presence for effecting judgment therefrom upon those who have been gathered together below the heavens, therefore these words signify that the higher heavens are in light and power from the Lord, to separate the evil from the good before the day of the last judgment. [2] That this is the internal sense of these words is evident from what follows in this chapter, also from what has been said above on this subject. From what follows in this chapter it is evident that the higher heavens are in light and power from the Lord, for this is why “they fell upon their faces and worshipped the Lord, and gave thanks that He had taken His great power and entered upon the kingdom,” and afterwards “the temple was opened in heaven, and there was seen in the temple the ark of the covenant,” this signifying the light there, and the former signifying the power there, from the Lord alone. It is also clear that it means to separate the evil from the good before the day of the last judgment, for it is said that “the nations were angered, and Thy anger is come, and the time of the dead to be judged”; and afterwards that “there were lightnings and voices and thunders and an earthquake and great hail,” which signifies the separation of the evil from the good, and is a sign of the presence of the last judgment. As these are the things treated of, and as “the twenty-four elders sitting before God upon the thrones” mean the higher heavens arranged for effecting therefrom the last judgment, it follows that all this is what is involved in these words."

[4] That a “throne” signifies heaven in general, and in particular the heavens where the Lord’s spiritual kingdom is, and in an abstract sense Divine truth proceeding from the Lord, and that it is predicated of judgment, may also be seen above (n. 253, 297, 343, 460, 482), where it is also shown that although it is said that the twenty-four elders “sat upon thrones,” likewise that “the apostles would sit upon twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel,” and also that “angels would come with the Lord to judgment,” yet it is the Lord alone who will judge, for “the twenty-four elders,” “the twelve apostles,” and the “angels,” mean all the truths of the church, and in brief, the Divine truth from which is judgment. And as by these Divine truth is meant, and all Divine truth proceeds from the Lord, therefore judgment belongs to the Lord alone. Who cannot see that to judge myriads of myriads, each one according to the state of his love and faith both in his internal and in his external man, would be impossible for any angel, and would be possible only for the Lord from the Divine that is in Him and that proceeds from Him; also that to judge all in the heavens and in the earths belongs to infinite wisdom and infinite power, not the least part of which falls to finite beings such as the angels are, and such as the elders of Israel and the apostles of the Lord were? These taken together would not be able to judge even a single man or a single spirit. For he who is to judge must see every state of the man who is to be judged from infancy to the end of his life in the world, and afterward what the state of his life is to be to eternity. For in every view and in each and every particular of judgment, there must be what is eternal and infinite, and that is in the Divine alone, and from the Divine alone, because it is infinite and eternal. 687b.

What “to sit before God” signifies, as here in reference to “the twenty-four elders,” can be seen from passages in the Word where the expression “to sit” occurs. For in the spiritual world all things that pertain to man’s movement or rest signify the things pertaining to his life, because they proceed from his life. Walking and journeying pertain to man’s movements, and thence signify progression of life, or progression of the thought from an intention of the will; but standing and sitting pertain to man’s rest, and thence signify the being [esse] of life, from which is its existence [existere]; thus they signify making to live. Therefore “to sit upon thrones,” in reference to judgment, signifies to be in the function of judging, thence also to judge; from which comes the expression “to sit in judgment,” which means to execute judgment. So “to sit upon a throne,” when concerning a kingdom, signifies to be a king or to reign. [6] What further is signified by “to sit” in the spiritual sense, can be seen from the following passages. In David: Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the wicked, and standeth not in the ways of sinners, and sitteth not in the seat of scoffers (Ps. 1:1). Here the expressions “to walk,” “to stand,” and “to sit,” are used as following one another, for “to walk” pertains to the life of thought from intention, “to stand” to the life of the intention from the will, and “to sit” to the life of the will, thus it is life’s being. Moreover, “counsel,” of which “walking” is predicated, has respect to thought, “way,” of which “standing” is predicated, has respect to the intention, and “to sit in a seat” has respect to the will, which is the being of man’s life. [7] As Jehovah, that is, the Lord, is the very being of everyone’s life, therefore He is said “to sit.” In David: Jehovah shall sit to eternity (Ps. 9:7)."

In Matthew: When the Son of man shall come in His glory, and all His holy angels with Him, then shall He sit upon the throne of His glory (Matt. 25:31). “To sit upon the throne of His glory” signifies to be in His Divine truth, from which is judgment. So again: When the Son of man shall sit on the throne of His glory ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel (Matt. 19:28; Luke 22:30). Since “angels,” as well as “the twelve apostles” and “the twelve tribes of Israel,” signify all the truths of the church, and in the highest sense, Divine truth, therefore “to sit upon thrones” means not that they themselves will sit, but the Lord as to Divine truth, from which is judgment; and “to judge the twelve tribes of Israel” signifies to judge all according to the truths of their church. From this it is clear that “to sit upon a throne,” in reference to the Lord, signifies one who judges, thus to judge. It is called “a throne of glory,” because “glory” signifies Divine truth (see above, n. 33, 288, 345, 678). [8] In the Gospels: David said in the book of Psalms, The Lord said to my Lord, Sit Thou at My right hand, until I make Thine enemies the footstool of Thy feet (Luke 20:42, 43; Mark 12:36; Ps. 110:1). “The Lord said to my Lord” signifies the Divine Itself, which is called the Father, to the Divine Human, which is the Son; “Sit Thou at My right hand” signifies Divine power, or omnipotence"

[9] In the same: Jesus said, Henceforth shall ye see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of power, and coming on the clouds of heaven (Matt. 26:63, 64; Mark 14:61, 62; Luke 22:69). “To sit at the right hand of power” signifies the Lord’s Divine omnipotence over the heavens and over the earths, after He had subjugated the hells and glorified His Human; “to come upon the clouds of heaven” signifies by means of Divine truth in the heavens; for after the Lord united His Human to the Divine Itself, then Divine truth proceeds from Him, and He Himself with angels and with men is in Divine truth, because He is in the Word, which is Divine truth, in which and from which is Divine omnipotence. [10] And again: The Lord, after He had spoken with them, was taken up into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God (Mark 16:19). “To sit at the right hand of God” has a like signification, namely, His Divine omnipotence by means of Divine truth. From this it is evident that “to sit” means to be, and “to sit at the right hand” means to be omnipotent. As “to sit” signifies to be, so “to sit upon a throne” signifies to be a king and to reign (Exod. 11:5; Deut. 17:18; 1 Kings 1:13, 17, 20; Jer. 17:25; 22:2, 30; and elsewhere).

This is said of Tyre, which signifies the church in respect to the knowledges of truth, but here of the church vastated, in which these knowledges are then falsified; therefore “all the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones” signifies that the knowledges of truth shall reign no more with the men of that church, for all sovereignty belongs to Divine truth; “to come down from thrones” signifies from governing, and thus to cease to rule, and “princes of the sea” mean the knowledges of truth, and those who are in them. “They shall sit upon the earth” signifies that they will be in falsifications, thus in falsities; “upon thrones” signifies to be in the truths of heaven, but “to sit upon the earth” signifies to be in falsities, since under the lands in the spiritual world are the hells, from which evils and falsities are continually exhaling.

Since “to sit” signifies to be, and also to continue in one state and pertains to the will, it is said in David: O Jehovah, Thou hast searched me and known me; Thou knowest my sitting and my rising, Thou understandest my thought afar off (Ps. 139:1, 2). “To know his sitting” has reference to the being of one’s life, which is the will, “rising” has reference to intention therefrom; and as thought follows from the intention of the will it is added, “Thou understandest my thought afar off.” [15] In Micah: Then shall he stand and feed in the name42 of Jehovah; and they shall sit, for now shall he increase unto the ends of the earth (Mic. 5:4).

[17] That “to sit” is an expression significative of the being and permanence of state of a thing and of life, can be seen from those passages in the Word where the expressions “to sit before Jehovah,” “to stand before Him,” and “to sit43 before Him” are used. “To sit before Jehovah” means to be with Him, thus to will and to act from Him; “to stand before Him” means to have regard for and to understand what He wills; and “to walk before Him” means to live according to His precepts, thus from Him. As such things are involved in “to sit,” therefore the corresponding word in Hebrew means to remain and to dwell. [18] Because of this signification of “to sit”: An angel of the Lord was seen sitting upon the stone which he had rolled away from the entrance to the tomb (Matt. 28:2). Angels were seen in the tomb, sitting one at the head, and the other at the feet (John 20:12; Mark 16:5). These things seen were representative of the Lord’s glorification, and of introduction into heaven by Him; for the “stone” that was placed before the sepulcher, and that was rolled away by the angel, signifies Divine truth, thus the Word, which was closed up by the Jews, but opened by the Lord. (That “stone” signifies truth, and in the highest sense, Divine truth, may be seen above, n. 417a,44 and in the work Heaven and Hell, n. 534.) And as a “sepulcher,” and preeminently the sepulcher where the Lord was, signifies in the spiritual sense resurrection and also regeneration, and “angels” signify in the Word Divine truth, therefore angels were seen sitting one at the head and the other at the feet; “the angel at the head” signifying Divine truth in things first, and “the angel at the feet” Divine truth in ultimates, both proceeding from the Lord; and when Divine truth is received regeneration is effected, and there is resurrection.

Again, the expression “they sat before Jehovah” is used when there was great joy; they were also said “to sit” when there was great mourning, and for the reason that “to sit” has reference to the being of man, which belongs to his will and love. (That they wept and sat before Jehovah see Judg. 20:26; 21:2.) 688. Fell upon their faces and worshipped God, signifies the adoration of the Lord with them from a most humble heart. This is evident from the signification of “to fall upon the face,” as being the deepest humiliation of heart, for it is a gesture of the body corresponding to humiliation of heart, thus a gesture that is representative of the humiliation of the whole man. Worship of God at such a time is what flows forth from such a heart, which varies according to the matter that engages the mind. [2] To fall upon the face before God is a gesture representative of deepest humiliation, because the face is the form of man’s affections and thus of the interiors that pertain to his mind and disposition, for the affections shine forth in the face as in their type, and this is why the face is called an index and image of the mind. When, therefore, a man acknowledges that all things in him are turned away from God, and are consequently damned, and that thus he is neither able nor dares to look to God, who is essential Holiness, and if he should look to Him from such a self he would spiritually die, then from such thought and acknowledgment man falls upon the face to the earth; and because what is man’s own is thus removed, he is then filled by the Lord and so raised up as to be able to look to Him.

Verse 17. Saying, we give Thee thanks, O Lord God Almighty, signifies the acknowledgment that all being, living, and ability are from the Lord. This is evident from the signification of “saying and giving thanks,” as being to acknowledge, since “to fall upon the face and to worship,” and then “to give thanks,” can have no other signification than to acknowledge, here the omnipotence of the Lord. Also from the signification of “the Lord God,” as being the Lord in respect to Divine good and Divine truth; for where Divine good is meant in the Word the names “Lord” and “Jehovah” are used, and where Divine truth is meant the name “God” is used, therefore “the Lord God” and “Jehovah God” mean the Lord in respect to Divine good and Divine truth. Moreover, “Jehovah” in the Old Testament, is called “Lord” in the New. It is also evident from the signification of “Almighty,” as being to be, to live, and to have ability of Himself, and also that the being, life, and ability of angels and men are from Him. (That this is meant by omnipotence, may be seen above, n. 43; also that Divine omnipotence means what is infinite, n. 286.) [2] In respect to Divine omnipotence: it does not involve any power to act contrary to order, but it involves all power to act according to order, for all order is from the Lord; from this it follows that no one has any power to act according to order except from Him from whom is order; and this shows that it is of the Divine omnipotence to lead man according to order, and this every moment from the beginning of his life even to eternity, and this it does according to the laws of order, which are innumerable, and the number of which cannot be expressed; and yet this can be done only so far as man suffers himself to be led, that is, so far as he is"

It is also of the Divine omnipotence to protect men from the hells, so far as this can be done without injury to freedom and reason; for all the hells are as nothing against the Lord’s Divine power; without this power of the Lord it is impossible for any man to be saved. (But more respecting omnipotence may be seen above, n. 43.) 690. Who is, and who was, and who is to come, signifies from Him who is the all in all things of heaven and the church from eternity to eternity, as is evident from the explanation of the same words above (n. 23, 41, 42). 691. Because Thou hast taken Thy great power and entered upon the kingdom, signifies the establishment of the new heaven and the new church, when the former heaven and church are destroyed. This is evident from the signification of “to take His great power and to enter upon the kingdom,” as being that when the former heaven and former church are destroyed the new heaven and the new church will be established; this is what is meant by “taking great"

This is brought into actuality by the last judgment, which is treated of in what follows. [2] That the Lord then has power and sovereignty can be illustrated by a comparison with the sun of the world; so long as the winter continues the sun has no power or sovereignty on the earth, because its heat is not received, for it is extinguished by the cold of the air and of the earth; but when spring is at hand the sun has power and sovereignty, for its heat is then received, and also its light, because it is joined with the heat, and from these the whole earth blossoms. It is similar with the Lord’s power and sovereignty, which come when the evil have been separated from the good and cast down into hell; for the evil are colds like those of winter, and they extinguish the spiritual heat of the sun, which is love, and bring to naught the power and sovereignty of the Lord, although viewed in Himself He is perpetually in the like omnipotence, yet He is not so in subjects until the new heaven and the new church come into existence. 692.

Verse 18. And the nations were angered, signifies the contempt, enmity, and hatred of the evil against the Lord and against the Divine things that are from Him, which are the holy things of heaven and the church. This is evident from the signification of “nations,” as being those who are in the goods of the church, and in a contrary sense those who are in evils, here those who are in evils, since it is said that “they were angered.” (That “nations” signify those who are in goods and those who are in evils, and in an abstract sense the goods and evils of the church, and that “peoples” signify those who are in truths and those who are in falsities, and in an abstract sense the truths and falsities of the church, may be seen above, n. 175, 331, 625.) Also from the signification of “to be angered,” as being, in reference to the evil, who are signified by “nations,” to be in contempt, enmity, and hatred against the Lord and against the Divine things that are from Him, which are the holy things of heaven and the church. [2] These and other like things are signified by “to be angered,” because everyone burns with wrath and is angered when his love and the delight of his love are assaulted, this being the cause of all wrath and anger; also for the reason that the love of everyone is his life, consequently to hurt the love is to hurt the life, and this being hurt causes commotion of mind, and thence anger and wrath. It is similar with the good when their love is assaulted, but with the difference that they have, not wrath or anger, but zeal. This zeal indeed is called anger in the Word, but still it is not anger; it is called anger because it appears in external form like anger, but inwardly it is nothing but charity, goodness, and clemency; consequently zeal does not, like anger, continue after the one towards whom it was kindled repents and turns away from evil."

This is why anger belongs to those who are in the loves of self and of the world, for they are in evils of every kind; while zeal belongs to those who are in love to the Lord and in love towards the neighbor. Therefore zeal looks to the salvation of man, but anger to his damnation; this also is in the purpose of the evil who are angered, but salvation is in the purpose of the good who are zealous. [3] “The nations were angered” signifies here the contempt, enmity, and hatred of the evil against the Lord and against the Divine things that are from Him, thus against the holy things of heaven and the church, because at the end of the church, a little before the last judgment, which is here treated of, there is a change of state with those who were in the former heaven and former earth, which is effected by the separation of the good from the evil; and when this has been effected the externals of the evil, by and from which they uttered what is true and did what is good from pretense and hypocrisy, are closed up, and the internals which in them are infernal are opened, and when these have been opened contempt, hostility, and hatred openly break forth with contumelies against the Lord and against the holy things of heaven and the church; for with them these things have lain stored up and covered over by the loves of self and the world; and these loves are such that they can do good and speak truths for the sake of self and of the world, because the holy things of heaven and the church serve them as means to ends, which are reputation, glory, honor, and gain, in a word, self and the world, and the means are loved for the sake of the ends. But since with such the end, which is of man’s love and thus of his intention and will, is corporeal and worldly, and consequently infernal, therefore the goods and truths that belong to heaven and the church with them do not abide in their internals, but only in their externals, because in these are evils and falsities. The goods and truths of heaven penetrate into the internals only with such as make the holy things of heaven and the church their ends, that is, make them to be of their love, and thence of their intention and will; when these are made ends, then"

But it is the exact opposite when the goods and truths of heaven and the church are not made ends, but means; for, as has just been said, ends belong to the ruling love of man, and when this is love of self it is also love of his own [proprium], and this regarded in itself is nothing but evil, and so far as man acts from it he acts from hell, and thus against the Divine. [4] Furthermore, it is to be known that in all evil there is anger against the Lord and against the holy things of the church. That this is so has been made clearly evident to me from the hells, in which all are in evils, and from which are all evils; for there when they merely hear the Lord named they become inflamed with vehement anger, not only against Him but also against all who confess Him. Thence it is that hell is the diametrical opposite of heaven, and is in the perpetual effort to destroy heaven, and to extinguish the Divine things therein, which are the goods of love and the truths of faith. This shows why evils are angry with goods, and falsities of evil with truths; this is why “anger” in the Word signifies evil in the whole complex. [5] It is similar in the following passages. In Luke: Jesus said, Woe to them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days; for there shall be great distress upon the land, and anger with the people (Luke 21:23). This is said of the consummation of the age, which is the last time of the church. That then good and truth cannot be received is signified by “Woe to them that are with child and to them that give suck.” The rejection of good because of the evil that will then rule in the church, and of truth because of falsity, is signified by “for there shall be great distress upon the land, and anger with the people,” “distress” here means the ruling evil, and “anger” the ruling falsity from evil, for at the end of the church the evil are distressed by good and angered by truth.

[7] In Moses: Simeon and Levi are brethren; in their anger they slew a man, and in their good pleasure they hocked an ox; cursed be their anger for it is fierce, and their wrath for it is hard; I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel (Gen. 49:5–7). “Reuben, Simeon, and Levi” signify faith, charity, and the works of charity; but here “Reuben” signifies faith separated from charity, from which comes neither charity nor any work of charity; for these three cohere together; such as the faith is such is the charity, and such as the charity is such are the works of charity; thus they are inseparable, each one belongs to the other, and is as the other. Because Reuben, on account of his adultery with the handmaid, his father’s concubine, was accursed, Simeon and Levi also were rejected; their rejection is signified by “I have divided them in Jacob and scattered them in Israel.” Now because faith, which was represented by “Reuben,” was not to be accepted as the first principle of the church, but spiritual good, which is truth in the understanding and will, therefore Joseph was accepted as the firstborn of the church in the place of Reuben, for “Joseph” represented spiritual good, which in its essence is truth in the understanding and will. Thence it may be clear what is signified by “the anger of Simeon and Levi that it was fierce, and their wrath that it was hard,” namely, the turning away from good and truth, thus evil and falsity in the whole complex; for when charity departs from faith there is no more any good nor any truth.

But it is unnecessary to cite more passages to show what “anger” and “wrath” signify in the case of those who are in evil, for it is self-evident that every evil conceals in itself anger against good, since it wills to extinguish the good, and even to kill him in whom good is, if not as to the body, still they do as to the soul, and this certainly comes from anger and is accompanied by anger. 694. And Thy anger is come, and the time of the dead to be judged, signifies the last judgment upon those who inwardly possess with themselves nothing of good and truth. This is evident from the signification of “anger” as being, in reference to the Lord, the last judgment (of which above, n. 413). This is evidently the signification of “anger” here, for it is added, “and the time of the dead to be judged.” Also from the signification of “the dead,” as being those who inwardly possess with themselves nothing of good and truth. Such are called “dead” because the essential life of man is his spiritual life, for it is through this that he is a man and is distinguished from beasts, which have only natural life.

In that internal man the ability to understand truth and perceive good has its seat, for that man is in heaven and in its light, and he who is in the light of heaven is a living man. But when the natural man only has been formed, and not at the same time the spiritual, there is no faculty of understanding and perceiving the truths and goods of heaven and the church, because that man has no light from heaven. For this reason such a man is called “dead.” That those who inwardly possess with themselves nothing of good and truth are here meant by “the dead who are to be judged,” can be seen from what has been said before about the separation of the evil from the good before the last judgment, and that the evil, when they have been separated, come into their interiors, which swarm with mere evils and falsities; from which it is clear that inwardly they were dead, although in external form they appeared to be living. 695a.

Those are called “prophets” who teach doctrine, thus in an abstract sense they signify doctrine.

From this it is clear that “to give reward to His servants, the prophets and saints,” signifies heaven to those who are in the truths of doctrine and in a life according to them. [2] That “reward” signifies salvation, and thus heaven, can be seen without amplification and explanation; but as few know what is properly meant by “reward” it shall be told. “Reward” means properly that delight, blessedness, and happiness that is in the love or affection of good and truth. This love or affection has in itself all joy of heart, which is called heavenly joy, and also heaven; and for the reason that the Lord is in that love or affection, and with the Lord is heaven; consequently such joy, or such delight, blessedness, and happiness, is what is properly meant by the “reward” that those will receive who do good and speak truth from the love or affection of good and truth, thus from the Lord, and in no wise from themselves; and as they do this from the Lord and not from themselves it is not a reward of merit but a reward of grace. This shows that whoever knows what heavenly joy is also knows what reward is. (What heavenly joy is in its essence can be seen in the work Heaven and Hell, n. 395–414.) This, therefore, is what is meant by the “reward” that those have who are in truths from good. But the “reward” that those have who are in falsities from evil is joy or delight, good fortune, and happiness in the world, but hell after their departure out of the world. 695b. [3] From these few words the signification of “reward” in the following passages can be seen. In Isaiah: Behold the Lord Jehovih cometh in strength; behold His reward is with Him, and the wages of His work are with47 Him (Isa. 40:10). Say to the daughter of Zion, Behold thy salvation cometh, and the wages of His work are with48 Him (Isa. 62:11). And in Revelation: Behold I come quickly, and My reward is with Me to give to each one as his work shall be (Rev. 22:12)."

That heaven will be received in the measure of the love and affection of good and truth from the Lord is meant by “the wages of His work are before Him,” and by “He will give to each one as his work shall be.” No other work is meant by the “work” for which heaven is given as a reward than work from the love or affection of good and truth, for from that must be every work with man from which is heaven. For a work derives its all from love or affection, just as the effect derives its all from the effecting cause, therefore such as the love or affection is, such is the work. Thence it may be clear what is meant by “the work according to which it shall be given to everyone,” and what is meant by “the wages of work.” [4] Likewise in Isaiah: I Jehovah love judgment, I will give the reward of their work in truth, and will make with them a covenant of eternity (Isa. 61:8). The “judgment that Jehovah loves” signifies truth in faith, in affection, and in act, for man has judgment from truth, both when he thinks and desires truth, and when he speaks truth and acts according to it; and as this is what is signified by “judgment,” therefore it is said “I will give the reward of their work in truth,” that is, heaven according to the faith of truth and the affection of it in act; and as from this is conjunction with the Lord, from whom reward comes, therefore it is added, “I will make with them a covenant of eternity,” “covenant” signifying in the Word conjunction by love, and “a covenant of eternity” conjunction by the love of good and truth, for that love conjoins, since it is of the Lord Himself and proceeds from Him."

In Matthew: Do not ye your alms before men; to be seen by them, for otherwise ye have no reward with your Father who is in the heavens. When thou doest alms sound not a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do, in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory from men; verily I say to you they have their reward. But thou, when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth, that thine alms may be in secret; then thy Father who seeth in secret will reward thee openly. And when thou prayest thou shalt not be as the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men; verily I say unto you, they have their reward; but when thou prayest enter into thy chamber, and shutting thy door pray to thy Father who is in secret; then thy Father who seeth in secret shall reward thee openly (Matt. 6:1–6). “Alms” in the most general sense signifies every good that man wills and does, and “to pray” signifies in the same sense every truth that man thinks and speaks. Those who do these two things “to be seen,” that is, that they may be manifest, do good and speak truth for the sake of self and the world, that is, for the sake of glory, which is the delight of self-love that the world affords. Because delight in glory is the reward of such it is said “they have their reward”; but this delight in glory, which in the world seems to them like heaven, is changed after death into hell. But those who do good and speak truth, not for the sake of self and the world but for the sake of good itself and truth itself, are meant by those who “do alms in secret,” and who “pray in secret,” for they act and pray from love or affection, thus from the Lord; this, therefore, is loving good and truth for the sake of good and truth; and of such it is said that “the Father in the heavens will reward them openly.” Thus “reward” is to be in goods and truths from love or affection, which is the same as being in them from the Lord, since in these is heaven and every blessedness and happiness of heaven.

The heavenly blessedness that is in such deeds and thence from them is “reward” and is meant by “it shall be recompensed thee in the resurrection of the dead.” [7] In the same: Rather love your enemies, and do good and lend, hoping for nothing again; then shall your reward be much, and ye shall be sons of the Most High (Luke 6:35). This has a similar signification as the previous passage, namely, that good is not to be done for the sake of recompense, that is, for the sake of self and the world, thus not for the sake of reputation, glory, honor, and gain, but for the Lord’s sake, that is, for the sake of good itself and truth itself which are with such from the Lord, thus in which the Lord is. “To love enemies and do good to them” means here, in the nearest sense, to love the Gentiles and do good to them, which is to be done by teaching them truth and leading them by it to good; for the Jewish nation called their own people brethren and friends, but the Gentiles they called adversaries and enemies. “To lend” signifies to communicate goods and truths of doctrine from the Word; “to hope for nothing again” signifies, not for the sake of anything of self and of the world, but for the sake of good and truth; “then shall your reward be much” signifies that then they shall have heaven with its blessedness and delights; “and ye"

[8] In Matthew: He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet’s reward; he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man’s reward. Whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold [water] only in the name of a disciple, he shall not lose his reward (Matt. 10:41, 42). How these words of the Lord are to be understood no one can see except from their internal or spiritual sense; for who can know what is meant by “receiving a prophet’s reward” and “a righteous man’s reward,” and by “receiving a prophet and a righteous man in the name of a prophet and a righteous man”; also what is meant by the “reward” that he will receive who “shall give to drink unto one of the little ones a cup of cold [water] only, in the name of a disciple”? Without the internal spiritual sense, who can see that these words mean that everyone shall receive heaven and its joy in the measure of his affection of truth and good, and in the measure of his obedience? [9] This meaning becomes evident when it is seen that “prophet” means the truth of doctrine, “righteous man” the good of love, and “disciple” the truth and good of the Word and of the church, and that “in their name” means for the sake of these, and according to their quality with those who do and teach them; also that “reward” means heaven, as has been said above, namely, that everyone has heaven in the measure of his affection of truth and good, and according to its quality and quantity; for on these affections all things of heaven are inscribed, since no one can have these affections except from the Lord, for it is the Divine proceeding from the Lord in which and from which is heaven.

That before this, no one had any spiritual affection of truth and good or any natural affection of truth and good is signified by “before these days there was no reward of man, nor reward of beast”; “man” signifying the spiritual affection of truth, and “beast” the natural affection of good, and “reward” heaven, which those have who are in the affections of truth and good. (That “man” signifies the spiritual affection of truth, and consequent intelligence, may be seen above, n. 280, 546, 547; and that “beast” signifies the natural affection, n. 650.) [13] “To him that went out and to him that came in there was no peace from the adversary” signifies that heretofore they had been infested by hell in every state of life; “to go out and come in” signifying the state of life from beginning to end, “there was no peace” signifying infestation by evils and falsities therefrom, and “adversary” signifying hell, the source of evils and falsities. “The seed of peace” signifies the truth of heaven and the church, which is from the Lord; this is called “the seed of peace” because it defends from the hells and gives security. “The vine shall give fruit and the land produce” signifies that the spiritual affection of truth shall bring forth the good of charity, and the natural affection of good and truth shall bring forth the works of charity; “vine” signifying the church in respect to the spiritual affection of truth, “land” the church in respect to the natural affection of truth, “fruit” the good of charity, and “produce” the works of that good. “The heavens shall give dew” signifies that these things are from influx through heaven from the Lord. [14] In John: Lift up your eyes and behold the fields, that they are white already for harvest; and he that reapeth receiveth reward and gathereth fruit unto life eternal, that he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together (John 4:35, 36)."

That it is at hand is signified by “the fields that are white already for harvest”; those of that church who are in the spiritual affection of truth, and thence in heaven, are meant by “he that reapeth receiveth reward and gathereth fruit unto life eternal”; and the Lord Himself, from whom is that affection of truth, and heaven, is meant by “he that soweth may rejoice together with him that reapeth.” [15] In Jeremiah: Rachel weeping for her sons, she refuseth to be comforted for her sons because they are not. But refrain thy voice from weeping and thine eyes from tears, for there is reward for thy labor, for they shall return from the land of the enemy; and there is hope for thy latter end, for thy sons shall return to their own border (Jer. 31:15–17; Matt. 2:18). This refers to the infant boys put to death in Bethlehem by command of Herod, as is evident from the passage cited in Matthew; but what this signifies has not heretofore been known. The signification is that when the Lord came into the world there was no spiritual truth remaining; for “Rachel” represented the internal spiritual church, and “Leah” the external natural church, “Bethlehem” the spiritual, and “the boys put to death” truth from that origin. That there was no spiritual truth any longer remaining is signified by “Rachel weeping for her sons, she refuseth to be comforted for her sons, because they are not.” [16] That henceforth there will be no grief on that account, because the Lord has been born, from whom there will be a new church that will be in truths from spiritual affection, is signified by “refrain thy voice from weeping and thine eyes from tears, for there is reward for thy labor,” “His reward” signifying heaven for those who will be of that church from the spiritual affection of truth, and “labor” signifying the Lord’s combats against the hells and the subjugation of the hells that a new church may be established. That the new church will be established in the place of the one that perished is signified by “they shall return from the land of the enemy, and there is hope for the latter end,” also by “thy sons shall return to their own border”; “to return from the land of the"

[17] In Isaiah: I said, I have labored in vain, I have consumed my strength in emptiness and vanity; yet surely my judgment is with Jehovah, and the reward of my work with my God (Isa. 49:4). This, again, is said of the establishment of the new church by the Lord. That it could not be established with the Jewish nation, because truths could not be received by that nation with any spiritual affection, is meant by “I said, I have labored in vain, I have consumed my strength in emptiness and vanity”; that still a spiritual church is being provided by the Lord, namely, among the Gentiles, is signified by “my judgment is with Jehovah, and the reward of my work is with my God”; “reward” here signifying the church that is in the spiritual affection of truth; and “labor and work” signifying the Lord’s combat against the hells and their subjugation, by which the Lord restored the equilibrium between heaven and hell, in which man is able to receive truth and to become spiritual. (On this equilibrium see in the work Heaven and Hell, n. 589–603, and in the small work Last Judgment, n. 33, 34, 73, 74.) [18] In David: Behold, sons are a heritage of Jehovah, the fruit of the womb is a reward; as darts in the hand of the mighty so are the sons of youth; happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them, they shall not be ashamed when they shall speak with enemies in the gate (Ps. 127:3–5). What is here signified by “sons,” “fruit of the womb,” “darts,” “quiver,” and “enemies in the gate,” may be seen above (n. 357b); and that “reward” here also signifies the happiness that those have who are in heaven."

This is said of those who fight and conquer in temptations induced by evils, that is, by hell; temptations are signified by “reviling,” “persecuting,” and “saying an evil word falsely for Christ’s sake,” for temptations are assaults and infestations of truth and good by falsities and evils; “Christ” means Divine truth from the Lord which is assaulted and on account of which they are infested. “Rejoice and exult, for much is your reward in the heavens,” signifies heaven with its joy which those have who are in the spiritual affection of truth, for such only fight and conquer, since the Lord resists and conquers for the man in the combats of temptations, and He is in that affection; “for so50 persecuted they the prophets who were before you” signifies that previously the truths of doctrine with those who were in the spiritual affection of truth had in like manner been assaulted, for “prophets” in a sense abstracted from persons signify truths from the Word or from the Lord. 695d.

[20] But those who speak truth and do good not from spiritual affection but from merely natural affection, and who think continually of heaven as a reward, were represented in the Israelitish church by “hired servants,” respecting whom there were in that church many statutes, as: That hired servants should not eat of the Passover (Exod. 12:43, 45);"

In Malachi: I will be against the oppressors of the hired servant in his wages, of the widow, and of the fatherless, and against them that turn aside the sojourner and fear not Me (Mal. 3:5); and elsewhere. Hired servants were forbidden to eat of the Passover and of things sanctified because they represented those that are natural and not spiritual, and the spiritual are of the church, but not so the natural. To look to heaven as a reward on account of the good that is done is natural, for the natural considers good to be from itself, thus heaven to be a reward; and this makes good meritorious. But it is otherwise with the spiritual, which acknowledges good as being not from itself but from the Lord, and thus heaven to be not from any merit but from mercy. Nevertheless, as those signified by “hired servants” still do good, although not from a spiritual affection but from a natural affection, which is obedience, and then think of heaven as a reward, they are mentioned with the “poor,” the “needy,” the “sojourners,” the “fatherless,” and the “widows,” because they are in spiritual poverty; for genuine truths are obscure to them, because light from heaven does not flow in through their spiritual man into the natural; this is why they are classed with those mentioned above, and it is commanded that “their reward shall be given them before the going down of the sun.” Moreover, such are in the lowest regions of the heavens, where they are servants, and are rewarded according to their works (see many things further in the New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine, n. 150–158)."

Such “hired servants” are meant in John: I am the good shepherd; the good shepherd layeth down his soul for the sheep. But a hired servant seeth the wolf and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth, because he is a hired servant (John 10:11–13). And in Jeremiah: A very fair she-calf is Egypt; destruction cometh out of the north; her hired servants are like fattened calves, for they also are turned, they flee together, they stood not, for the day of their calamity is come upon them (Jer. 46:20, 21); and elsewhere (Isa. 16:14; 21:16). [22] Because in the Word “reward” signifies heaven, which those have who are in the spiritual love of truth and good, so in the contrary sense “reward” signifies hell, which those have who are in the love of falsity and evil. Such is the signification of “reward” in David: He shall clothe himself with cursing as with his garment and it entereth into the midst of him as waters, and as oil among his bones. This is the reward of mine adversaries from Jehovah, and of them that speak evil against my soul (Ps. 109:18, 20). By this in the spiritual sense the Lord is meant, for where David speaks of himself in the Psalms, in that sense the Lord is meant, David as a king representing the Lord, and thus signifying Him in relation to the Divine-spiritual, which is the Lord’s royalty. “The reward of the Lord’s adversaries, and of them that speak evil against His soul,” is described as a hell from the love of falsity and evil, by this, that “he shall clothe himself with curs ing as with his garment” and “it hath entered into the midst of him as waters, and as oil among his bones,” these two expressions describing hell as received in externals and in internals, “to clothe himself with cursing as with a garment” describing the hell that is received in externals, and"

What “building an eminent place at the head of every way, and making an exalted place in every street” signifies may be seen above (n. 652c). That “adulteries and whoredoms” signify in the Word the adulterations and falsifications of the truth and good of the church may be seen above (n. 141, 511); therefore “not to have been as a harlot to glory in reward” signifies not to have so falsified the truths of the Word from the delight of affection; “the adulterous woman received strangers instead of her husband” signifies the truths and goods of the Word perverted by the falsities of other nations; “they give reward to all harlots, but thou hast given thy rewards to all thy lovers and hast given them presents,” signifies that they loved the falsities of religion and of the worship of other nations; a “reward or gift of whoredom” meaning the love of falsifying by means of the falsities of others; “that they might come unto thee from every side in thy whoredoms” signifies that falsities were searched for from every direction, whereby truth was falsified; “thus the contrary is in thee from women in thy whoredoms, that they went not after thee to commit whoredom in giving a reward, and no reward has been given to thee, therefore thou hast been contrary,” signifies the delight of the love and affection of falsifying the truths of their church by the falsities of other religions, and of confirming such falsities, “the reward or gift of whoredoms” meaning the delight of the love and affection towards the falsities of other religions. [26] From that which has been stated, what is meant spiritually by “reward” in both senses can now be seen; for that which affects with delight and joy is spiritual reward.

And to them that fear Thy name, the small and the great, signifies and to all of whatever religion who worship the Lord. This is evident from the signification of “fearing the name” of the Lord God, as being to worship the Lord (of which presently); also from the signification of “the small and the great,” as being of whatever religion; for “the small” mean those who have but little knowledge of the truths and goods of the church, and “the great” those who know much, thus those who worship the Lord little and much; for in the measure that a man knows the truths of faith and lives according to them does he worship the Lord, for worship is not from man but from the truths from good that are with man, since these are from the Lord, and the Lord is in them. “They that fear Thy name, the small and the great,” mean all of whatever religion who worship the Lord, because just before “the servants, the prophets and the saints,” are mentioned, meaning all within the church who are in the truths of doctrine and in a life according to them; therefore “they that fear Thy name, the small and the great,” mean all without the church who worship the Lord according to their religion, for those who are in the worship of the Lord, and live in any faith and charity, according to their religious principle, also fear God’s name. In fact, this verse treats of the last judgment upon all, both the evil and the good; and the last judgment is executed upon all, both those within the church and those outside of it; and then all are saved who fear God and live in mutual love, in uprightness of heart and in sincerity from a religious principle, for all such, by an intuitive faith in God and by a life of charity, are consociated as to their souls with the angels of heaven, and are thus"

It is similar with “the servants, the prophets and the saints,” just above, by whom in the spiritual sense prophets and saints are not meant, but, apart from persons, the truths of doctrine and a life according to them. But while these are meant, all who are in the truths of doctrine and a life according to them are also included, for such truths and life are in subjects which are angels and men; but in such case to think of angels and men only is natural, while to think of the truths of doctrine and life, which make angels and men, is spiritual. Thence it may be clear how the spiritual sense in which the angels are, differs from the natural sense in which men are, namely, that in every particular that a man thinks there inheres something of person, space, time and matter, while angels think things abstractly from all these. Thence it is that the speech of angels is incomprehensible to man, because it is from the intuition of the thing, and thus from a wisdom abstracted from things that are proper to the natural world, and therefore comparatively undetermined to such things.

That such is the signification of “the name of Jehovah,” “the Lord God,” and “Jesus Christ,” may be seen above (n. 102, 135, 224), and is also evident from these words of the Lord: If two of you shall agree on earth in My name respecting anything that they shall ask it shall be done for them by My Father who is in the heavens. For where two or three are gathered together in My name, there am I in the midst of them (Matt. 18:19, 20). Here “to agree in the Lord’s name” and “to be gathered together in His name” means not in mere name, but in those things that belong to the Lord, which are the truths of faith and the goods of love by which He is worshipped. [4] “To fear,” in reference to the Lord, signifies to worship and reverence, because in worship and in all things of worship there is a holy and reverential fear, which is that the Lord is to be honored and in no way injured; for it is as with children towards parents and parents towards children, with wives towards husbands and husbands towards wives, also as with friends towards friends, in whom there is a fear of injuring and also respect; such a fear with respect is in all love and in all friendship, so that love and friendship without such a fear and respect is like food not salted, which is insipid. This is why “to fear the Lord” means to worship Him from such love. [5] It is said that “to fear Thy name” signifies to worship the Lord, and yet “those who fear Him” mean here all those who are outside of the church, to whom the Lord is unknown, because they do not have the Word; nevertheless, all such as in respect to God have an idea of the Human are still accepted by the Lord, for God under the Human form is the Lord; but all, whether within or without the church, who do not think of God as Man, when they come into their own spiritual life, which takes place after their departure out of this world, are not accepted by the Lord, because they have no determinate idea of God, but only an indeterminate"

This is why all who come from the earths into the spiritual world are first explored, as to what idea of God they have had and have brought with them. If they have no idea of Him as Man they are sent to places of instruction, where they are taught that the Lord is the God of heaven and earth, and that when they think of God they must think of the Lord, and that otherwise there can be no conjunction with God, and thus no consociation with angels. Then all who have lived a life of charity receive instruction and worship the Lord. But all those who say that they have had faith, but have not been in the life of faith, which is charity, do not accept instruction; consequently they are separated and sent away into places below the heavens, some into the hells, some into the earth that is called in the Word “the lower earth,” where they suffer hard things. Still the Gentiles who have made the laws of religion laws of life receive the doctrine respecting the Lord more readily than Christians, and this especially because they had no other idea of God than that of the Divine Man. This has been said that it may be known why it is that “to fear Thy name” means to worship the Lord. 696b. [6] In many passages in the Word the expression “to fear Jehovah God” is used, and this means to worship Him; therefore it shall be told in a few words what worship in particular is meant by “fearing God.” All worship of Jehovah God must be from the good of love by means of truths. Worship that is from the good of love alone is not worship, neither is worship that is from truths alone, without the good of love, worship; there must be both, since the good of love is the essential of worship, but good has its existence and form by means of truths, therefore all worship must be from good by means of truths. For this reason, in many passages in the Word where the expression “to fear Jehovah God” is used it is added, “to keep and to do His words and commandments”; consequently in these places “to fear” signifies worship by means of truths, and “to keep and do” signifies worship from the good of love, for doing is of the will, thus of the love and of good, but “fearing” is of the understanding, thus of faith and of truth, since every truth that is of faith belongs properly to the understanding, and every good that is of love belongs properly to the will.

Such worship is meant by “the fear of Jehovah God,” because Divine truth causes fear in that it condemns the evil to hell; but Divine good does not, since so far as it is received through truths by man and angel it takes away condemnation. Thence it may be seen that so far as man is in the good of love there is fear of God; also that dread and terror disappear and become a holy fear attended with reverence so far as man is in the good of love and in truths therefrom, that is, so far as there is good in his truths. From this it follows that fear in worship varies with each one according to the state of his life; and also that the sanctity attended with reverence that there is in fear with those that are in good, varies also according to the reception of good in the will and according to the reception of truth in the understanding, that is, according to the reception of good in the heart and the reception of truth in the soul. [7] But what has now been said can be seen more clearly from the following passages in the Word. In Moses: What doth Jehovah thy God ask of thee but to fear Jehovah thy God, to walk in all His ways and to love Him, and to serve Jehovah thy God with thy whole heart and with thy whole soul? (Deut. 10:12, 20) The expressions “to fear Jehovah God,” “to walk in His ways,” “to love Him,” and “to serve Him,” are here used, and by all these worship by truths from good is described; worship by truths is meant by “fearing Jehovah God” and by “serving Him,” and worship from good by “walking in His ways” and by “loving Him”; therefore it is also said “with the whole heart and with the whole soul,” “heart” signifying the good of love and charity that belongs to the will, and “soul” the truth of doctrine and faith that belongs to the understanding; for “heart” corresponds to the good of love, and in man to his will, and “soul” corresponds to the truth of faith, and in man to his understanding, for soul [anima] means the breathing or respiration of man, which is also called his spirit."

[8] In the same: Ye shall go after Jehovah your God and ye shall fear Him, that ye may keep His commandments and hear His voice and serve Him and cleave unto Him (Deut. 13:4). “To go after Jehovah God, to keep His commandments, and to cleave unto Him,” signifies the good of life, thus the good of love from which is worship; and “to fear Jehovah God, to hear His voice, and to serve Him,” signifies the truths of doctrine, thus the truths of faith by means of which is worship. As all worship of the Lord must be by means of truths from good, and not by means of truths without good, nor by means of good without truths, therefore in every particular of the Word there is a marriage of good and truth, as in the passages already cited, and also in the following. (On the marriage of good and truth, in the particulars of the Word, see above, n. 238 at the end, 288b, 660.) [9] In the same: Thou shalt fear Jehovah thy God, Him shalt thou serve, and to Him shalt thou cleave, and in His name shalt thou swear (Deut. 10:20). Here also “to fear Jehovah God and to serve Him,” has reference to the truths of worship, and “to cleave unto Jehovah God and to swear in His name” has reference to the good of worship; for “to cleave to” is a word of the good of love, since one who loves cleaves to; “to swear in the name of Jehovah” in like manner, since the doing of something is confirmed by it. “To serve” has reference to the truths of worship, because in the Word “servants” mean those who are in truths, and for the reason that truths serve good (see above, n. 6, 409).

Thou shalt fear Jehovah thy God and Him shalt thou serve, and shalt swear in His name. Ye shall not go after other gods. Jehovah hath commanded us to do all these statutes to fear Jehovah our God (Deut. 6:2, 13, 14, 24). Here, too, in like manner worship by means of truths from good, or by means of faith from love is described; “to fear Jehovah God and to serve Him” means worship by means of the truths of faith; and “to keep and do His statutes and commandments, and to swear in the name of Jehovah,” means worship from the good of love; for to keep and do statutes and commandments is the good of life, which is the same as the good of love, since he lives that loves; “to swear in the name of Jehovah” has a like meaning, for “to swear” means to confirm by life. It has already been said above that “to fear Jehovah and to serve Him” means worship according to the truths of doctrine. For there are two things that constitute worship, namely, doctrine and life; doctrine without life does not constitute it, neither does life without doctrine. 696c. [11] The like is taught in the following passages. In Deuteronomy: Assemble the people that they may hear, and that they may learn and fear Jehovah your God, and may observe to do all the words of the law (Deut. 31:12). If thou wilt not observe to do all the precepts of this law, to fear this glorious and venerable name, Jehovah thy God (Deut. 28:58). The king shall write for himself a copy of the law, and he shall read in it all the days of his life, whereby he may learn to fear Jehovah his God, to keep all the words of the law, and the statutes to do them (Deut. 17:18, 19). Thou shalt keep the commandments of Jehovah thy God, to walk in His ways and to fear Him (Deut. 8:6). Who will give that they may have a heart to fear Me, and to keep all My commandments all the days (Deut. 5:29)."

Worship according to the truths of doctrine is signified by “fearing Jehovah,” and worship from the good of life by “keeping His commandments and walking in his ways,” “to walk in the ways of Jehovah” meaning to live according to the truths of doctrine; and as worship according to the truths of doctrine is meant by “fearing Jehovah,” therefore it is said that the fear of Jehovah must be learned from the law. But let it be known that “the fear of Jehovah” means the internal spiritual worship that must be in external natural worship, for internal spiritual worship is thinking and understanding truths, thus thinking in a reverent and holy way about God, which is “fearing Him,” and external natural worship is doing truths, that is, keeping the commandments and words of the law. [12] In David: Teach me Thy way, O Jehovah, teach it53 in truth, unite my heart to the fear of Thy name (Ps. 86:11). “To teach the way” signifies to teach the truth according to which man must live; therefore it is said “teach it in truth.” That the good of love must be conjoined with the truths of faith is signified by “unite my heart to the fear of Thy name,” “heart” signifying the love, “fear” the holiness of faith, and these must be “united,” that is, be together in worship. [13] In the same: Blessed is everyone that feareth Jehovah, that walketh in His ways (Ps. 128:1). Here again, “to fear Jehovah” means to think in a reverent and holy way about God, and “to walk in His ways” means to live according"

But in external worship, which is living according to Divine truths, there must be internal worship, which is fearing Jehovah; and this is why it is said that “he that feareth Jehovah walketh in His ways.” In the same: Blessed is the man that feareth Jehovah, that delighteth exceedingly in His commandments (Ps. 112:1). The signification of this is similar as above; for “to delight exceedingly in Jehovah’s commandments” is to love them, thus to will and to do them. [14] In Jeremiah: They feared not, neither did they go in My law and in My statutes (Jer. 44:10). “Not fearing” stands for not thinking about God from the truths of the Word, thus not thinking in a holy and reverent way; “not to go in God’s law and in His statutes,” stands for not living according to them, “commandments” meaning the laws of internal worship, and “statutes” the laws of external worship. [15] In Malachi: If I be a Father, where is My honor? If I be a Lord, where is the fear of Me? (Mal. 1:6) The terms “honor” and “fear” are used because “honor” is predicated of the worship from good, and “fear” of the worship by means of truths (that “honor” is predicated of good may be seen above, n. 288, 345); therefore “honor” is also predicated of Father, and “fear” of Lord, for Jehovah is called “Father” from Divine good, and “Lord” here from Divine truth."

[17] In Isaiah: The spirit of Jehovah resteth upon Him, the spirit of wisdom and intelligence, the spirit of counsel and of might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of Jehovah, whence his offering of incense shall be in the fear of Jehovah (Isa. 11:2, 3). This, too, is said of the Lord, and these words describe Divine truth, in which and from which is all wisdom and all intelligence. The Divine truth that was in the Lord when He was in the world, and that since the glorification of His Human proceeds from Him, is meant by “the spirit of Jehovah that rested upon Him”; that thence He has Divine wisdom and Divine power from that source is meant by “the spirit of wisdom and intelligence; and the spirit of counsel and of might”; that He has omniscience and essential holiness in worship from that source is meant by “the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of Jehovah”; and as “fear” signifies the holiness of worship from Divine truth it is added “whence His offering of incense shall be in the fear of Jehovah,” “to offer incense” signifying worship from the Divine spiritual, which is Divine truth. (That this is what “offering incense” signifies see above, n. 324, 491, 492, 494, 567.) It is said “the spirit of wisdom, intelligence, knowledge, and fear,” for “spirit” means the Divine proceeding, “the spirit of wisdom” the celestial Divine, which is the Divine proceeding as received by the angels of the kingdom of the inmost or third heaven, “the spirit of intelligence” the spiritual Divine which is the Divine proceeding as received by the angels of the middle or second heaven, “the spirit of knowledge” the natural Divine, which is the"

Because conjunction with the Lord is effected by means of truths from good, and not by means of truth without good, nor by means of good without truths, both are here mentioned. [19] In David: O house of Aaron trust ye in Jehovah, ye that fear Jehovah trust in Jehovah (Ps. 115:10, 11). “House of Aaron” signifies all who are in the good of love, and “those that fear Jehovah” signify all who are in truth from that good.

The good pleasure of Jehovah is in them that fear Him, in them that wait for His mercy (Ps. 147:11). Because “the fear of Jehovah” signifies the reception of Divine truth, and “mercy” the reception of Divine good, it is said that “the eye” and “the good pleasure of Jehovah are upon them that fear Him, that wait for His mercy.” [20] In Isaiah: The strong people shall honor Thee, the city of the terrible nations shall fear Thee (Isa. 25:3). Here again, worship from good is signified by “to honor,” for “honor” is predicated of the good of love; and worship from truths is signified by “fearing the Lord,” as has been said above. “The strong people” signifies men of the church who are in truths from good, wherefrom is all power; “the city of the terrible nations” signifies those who are in truths of doctrine, and through these in the good of love; and as all spiritual power is therefrom they are called “terrible nations.” These words, too, show clearly that there is a marriage of good and truth in every particular of the Word; for “to honor” is predicated of good, “to fear” of truth, both in worship; the term “people” is used of those who are in truths, and through these in good, but the term “nations” of those who are in good, and from good in truths; and as all power in the spiritual world is from the conjunction of good and truth, the people are called “strong,” and the nations are called “terrible.”"

Who among you feareth Jehovah, heareth the voice of His servant? He that walketh in darkness, and hath no brightness, that trusteth in the name of Jehovah, and leaneth upon his God (Isa. 50:10).

Who have no changes, neither fear they God (Ps. 55:19). The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom; a good understanding have all they that do them [his commandments] (Ps. 111:10). Because “fear” has respect to Divine truth, from which is holiness in worship and wisdom and intelligence, therefore it is said, “the fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom, a good understanding (that is, intelligence) have all they that do them [his commandments].” In the same: They that fear Jehovah shall praise Him, all the seed of Jacob shall honor Him, and all the seed of Israel shall fear Him (Ps. 22:23).

In Moses: Ye shall keep My Sabbaths, and My sanctuary ye shall fear; ye shall reverence (Lev. 19:30; 26:2). A work of Jehovah, how is that to be feared [reverenced] which I will do (Exod. 34:10). And Jacob feared and said, How to be feared [reverenced] is this place; this is none other than the house of God, and the gate of heaven (Gen. 28:17). That in reference to the Divine and the holiness of heaven and the church, “to fear” signifies to revere and to hold in reverence, is evident from these passages, also from this, that the same word in the Hebrew that means “to fear” means also to revere and to venerate. This is evident, too, from those words in Luke: There was a judge in a certain city who feared not God and reverenced not man. And he said within himself, Although I fear not God and reverence not man . . . (Luke 18:2, 4). It is said “to fear God” and “to reverence man” because fearing means reverencing in a higher degree. [23] In Matthew: Jesus said, Fear not them who are able to kill the body but are not able to kill the soul; rather fear Him who is able to destroy both body and soul in Gehenna (Matt. 10:28; Luke 12:4, 5, 7).

In such a fear is the spiritual man, and he knows that the Lord does not do evil to anyone, much less does He destroy anyone as to body and soul in Gehenna, but that He does good to all and desires to raise up everyone as to body and soul into heaven to Himself. This is why the fear of the spiritual man is a holy fear lest by the evil of life and the falsity of doctrine man should turn away, and thus do harm to that Divine love in himself. But natural fear is a fearfulness, dread, and terror of dangers and punishments, and thus of hell; this fear abides within every corporeal love, also variously according to the quality and quantity of the love. The natural man who has such fear does not know otherwise than that the Lord does evil to the evil, condemns them, casts them into hell, and punishes them, and on this account such persons are in fear and dread of the Lord. In this fear were most of the Jewish and Israelitish nation, because they were natural men; and this is why they are so often said in the Word “to be afraid of” and “to tremble before Jehovah,” and also “to be in fear and trembling”; and for the same reason it is said of the sons of Israel that they were “sore afraid” when the Divine law or Divine truth was promulgated from Mount Sinai (Exod. 20:18–20; Deut. 5:23–25). [24] This fear is what is meant in part by: The dread of Isaac by which Jacob sware to Laban (Gen. 31:42, 53); for “Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,” mean in the Word the Lord, “Abraham,” the Lord in respect to the celestial Divine, “Isaac,” in respect to the spiritual Divine, and “Jacob,” in respect to the natural Divine; the spiritual Divine which “Isaac” signifies is the Divine truth, which terrifies the natural man, and as “Laban” was a natural man, so Jacob sware to him “by the dread or terror of Isaac.” Nearly the same fear is meant in Isaiah: Ye shall sanctify Jehovah of Hosts, for He is your fear and your dread (Isa. 8:13)."

In Luke: Fear not, little flock; for it hath pleased your Father to give you the kingdom (Luke 12:32). And in Jeremiah: Fear not, O Jacob, My servant, and be not dismayed, O Israel, for I will save thee from afar; Jacob shall be tranquil and quiet, none shall make him afraid (Jer. 30:9, 10).

And to destroy them that are destroying the earth, signifies hell to those who destroy the church. This is evident from the signification of “to destroy,” as being, in reference to those that destroy the church, damnation and hell; for as “to give the reward to His servants, the prophets and the saints,” signifies salvation and heaven to those who are in truths from good, that is, who constitute the church, so “to destroy” the earth signifies damnation and hell. Also from the signification of the “earth,” as meaning the church (of which above, n. 29, 304, 413b, 417a); therefore “to destroy the earth” signifies to destroy the church. That in the Word the “earth” means the church has been shown frequently above, also in Arcana Coelestia.

So again, when the church, or religion, or worship, is in one’s thought, and from this lands are mentioned, the land is not thought of, but the quality of the nation of the land in respect to the church, religion, or worship. For this reason when a man in reading the Word mentions a land, the angels, who are spiritual, think of the church; and what the angels think is the spiritual sense of the Word; for the spiritual sense of the Word is for the angels, and also for those men who are spiritual. For the Word in the letter is natural, and yet inwardly or in its bosom it is spiritual; and whenever the natural is withdrawn the spiritual that is within or in its bosom is disclosed. [2] Moreover, there are lands in the spiritual world, that is, in the world where spirits and angels are, equally as in the natural world where men are, and these lands are altogether alike in external appearance; there are there plains, valleys, mountains, hills, and there are rivers, and seas, and also fields, meadows, forests, gardens, and paradises; and those lands are in appearance beautiful in exact accord with the state of the church with those who dwell upon them, and they undergo changes in accord with the changes of the church with the inhabitants; in a word, there is a full correspondence of the lands there with the reception of the good of love and the truth of faith with those who dwell there. It is for this reason also that “land” in the Word signifies the church, for in that world according to the quality of the land is the quality of the church there, and correspondence is what makes it be so. In that world the land itself makes one with the church, as a correspondent with its own thing to which it corresponds, just as an effect does with its effecting cause, as the eye with its sight, as speech with its understanding, as action with the will, as the expression of the face with the affection of the thought, in a word, as the instrumental with its principal, of which it is said that they make one thing; so in the spiritual world the quality of the land makes one with that of the church.

This is said of Lucifer, by whom Babylon is here meant, as is evident from what here precedes and follows; and “the earth that he maketh to tremble and that he destroyed” signifies the church; the “kingdoms that he maketh to quake” signify the churches into which the general church is divided; the “world that he made a wilderness” signifies the church in general; the “cities that he threw down” signify its truths of doctrine; and the “people that he slew” signify the men of the church whose spiritual life he destroyed.

In Moses: There shall not be anymore a flood to destroy the earth (Gen. 9:11). Here again “the earth” also signifies the church that was destroyed by the antediluvians, but was not again to be destroyed.

The “temple” signifies here the new heaven and the new church where there is worship of the Lord, because this chapter treats of the changes of state that precede the last judgment, namely, the separation of the evil from the good, and their removal from the places where they had been previously. When this is done, the new heaven and the new church appear to those who are in the higher heavens. These could not appear so long as the good were conjoined with the evil, because their interiors were closed that they might not be harmed by the evil with whom they had communication in respect to externals. But when the evil had been separated and removed, then the interiors with the good, which were in themselves heavenly, were opened, and when these had been opened, heaven and the church lay open; for so far as the interiors which are heavenly and celestial are opened, what heaven is in relation to the church with those who have heaven and the church in them, becomes manifest. [2] From self-intelligence no one can know that these things are so, for they are arcana of heaven, that must be learned from revelation. For who can know how the last judgment was accomplished, or what changes in the spiritual world preceded it and what followed it? But that these things might be known they have been manifested to me, wherefore it is permitted me to describe them here from revelation.

(Respecting this Trinity see what has been said in the New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine, n. 250–310). This also is what is meant in Revelation where the New Jerusalem is treated of: I saw heaven54 and no temple therein, for the Lord God the Almighty, and the Lamb, are the temple thereof (Rev. 21:22). “The Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb” mean the Lord in relation to the Divine Itself and the Divine Human. It is here said that no temple was seen, because “temple” signifies in the highest sense, the Lord in relation to Divine truth and worship (see above, n. 220, 391b, c, e, 630), also because “the New Jerusalem” means the church in respect to doctrine, or the doctrine of the New Jerusalem. Nevertheless there are temples in heaven, in which the Lord is preached and Divine truth is taught. 700a. And there was seen in his temple the ark of His covenant, signifies Divine truth, by which there is conjunction with the Lord. This is evident from the signification of “the ark of the covenant,” as being Divine truth proceeding from the Lord (of which presently). “The ark of the covenant” was seen, because “the temple” appeared, and the ark was in the midst of the temple at Jerusalem, and in it were placed the two tables of the law, which signify in a universal sense Divine truth proceeding from the Lord, thus the Lord Himself, who is Divine truth in the heavens; for which reason the Lord is called the Word, in John 1:1, 2, 14. This is the signification of “the ark,” because the tent of meeting represented the three heavens, its court the lowest or first heaven; the tent itself as far as the veil, wherein were the tables for the loaves, the altar of incense, and the lamp stand, represented the middle or second heaven; and the ark, which was within the veil, upon which was the mercy seat with the cherubim, represented the inmost or third heaven; and the law itself which was in the ark, represented the Lord in relation to Divine truth or the Word; and"

That in the Word “covenant” signifies conjunction, and that all things of the church, both internal and external, are signs of the covenant, and that they are called covenant because conjunction is effected by means of them, n. 665, 666, 1023, 1038, 1864, 1996, 2003, 2021, 2037, 6804, 8767, 8778, 9396, 9416, 10632.

And thou shalt make a mercy seat of pure gold; and thou shalt make two cherubim of gold, solid shalt thou make them out of the mercy seat that the cherubim may spread out their wings, and cover the mercy seat with their wings; and their faces shall be towards the mercy seat. And thou shalt put the testimony into the ark; and there I will meet with thee, and I will speak with thee from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubim which are upon the ark of the testimony, of all things which I shall command thee unto the sons of Israel (Exod. 25:8–22)."

It was said above that the tent where there were the ark, the lamp stand, the table for the loaves, and the altar for incense, together with the court, represented the three heavens, and that the place within the veil where the ark was that contained the law or testimony, represented the third heaven. That place represented that heaven, because the law was there, and the “law” means the Lord in relation to Divine truth or the Word, for this in a broad sense is what that “law” signifies, and it is Divine truth proceeding from the Lord that forms the heavens. This is received in the greatest purity by the angels of the third heaven, because they are in conjunction with the Lord through love to Him, since all angels in that heaven are in love to the Lord; consequently they see Divine truth in themselves, like some thing implanted, although it flows in continually from the Lord. For this reason that heaven more than the other heavens which are below it, is said to be in the Lord, because it is in the Divine that proceeds from Him. [3] It was that heaven that was represented by the ark that contained the law, that is, the Lord. This is why the ark was overlaid with gold within and without, and the mercy seat was over the ark, and over the mercy seat and out of it were the two cherubim which were of pure gold; for gold signifies from correspondence the good of love, in which are the angels of the third heaven. The “mercy seat” signified the hearing and reception of all things of the worship that is from the good of love from the Lord; and the “cherubim” signified the Lord’s providence and guard that He be not approached except through the good of love. That heaven with its angels is a guard against anything being elevated to the Lord Himself except what proceeds from the good of love to Him and from Him. For all worship of God passes through the heavens even to the Lord, and is purified in the way, until it is elevated to the third heaven, and there it reaches55 the"

This is why cherubim of gold were placed over the mercy seat, which was over the ark; also why that place was called a sanctuary, and also the holy of holies, and was divided from the outer part of the tabernacle by the veil. [4] That the tent with the court represented the three heavens is evident also from this, that all things instituted among the sons of Israel were representatives of heavenly things; for the church itself was a representative church; thus especially the tabernacle with the altar was the most holy thing of worship; for worship was celebrated upon the altar by burnt offerings and sacrifices, and in the tabernacle by incense offerings, and by the lamps that were lighted every day, and by the loaves that were placed in order daily upon the table. All these represented all worship in heaven and in the church, and the tent itself with the ark represented the heavens themselves. For this reason that tabernacle was called “the dwelling place of Jehovah God,” as heaven itself is called. That the heavens were represented by the tabernacle is evident also from this, that the form of it was shown to Moses by the Lord upon Mount Sinai, and what is shown in form by the Lord must represent either heaven or the things belonging to heaven. That the form of the tabernacle was shown to Moses upon Mount Sinai, can be seen from what was said to Moses: Let them make Me a sanctuary, that I may dwell in the midst of them, according to all that I have shown thee, the form of the habitation. [And afterwards:] See and make them in their form which thou wast made to see in the mount (Exod. 25:8, 9, 40). That is why it is called “a sanctuary,” and it is said “that I may dwell in the midst of them.” In respect to the ark in particular, that is, what it signifies, also “the mercy seat over it,” and “the cherubim over the mercy seat,” as also “the border of gold round about the ark,” and also “the four rings for the staves,” also “the veil,” “the clasps,” and the other things, all this may be seen explained in Arcana Coelestia (n. 9484– 9577, 9670–9680)."

That the Lord is the Word is evident from what is said in John: The Word was with God, and God was the Word, and the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us (John 1:1, 2, 14). 700b. That the law, which is called both “the testimony” and “the covenant,” was placed in the ark, likewise the book written by Moses, can be seen from these words in Moses: Thou shalt put into the ark the testimony that I shall give thee (Exod. 25:16; 40:20). I put the tables of the law in the ark that I had made, that they might be there, even as Jehovah commanded me (Deut. 10:5). And of the book of the law written by Moses: When Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law upon the book, even when he had finished them, Moses commanded the Levites that bare the ark to take the book of the law, and put it by the side of the ark of the covenant, that it might be there for a witness (Deut. 31:24–26). This shows that there was nothing inside of the ark except the two tables of stone on which the law was written, and that the book of Moses was by the side of it. That there was nothing in the ark except the two tables of the covenant is evident from the first book of Kings: There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone, which Moses put there at Horeb, the covenant which Jehovah made with the sons of Israel (1 Kings 8:9)."

The Lord spoke to Moses therefrom because the law was there, and that law signifies in a broad sense the Lord in relation to the Word, and from the Word the Lord speaks with man; it was “from above the mercy seat between the two cherubim,” because “the mercy seat” signifies the removal of falsities that are from evil loves, and at the same time reception and hearing, and “the cherubim” signify a guard that there be no approach except through the good of love.

And they journeyed from the mount of Jehovah a way of three days, and the ark of the covenant of Jehovah journeyed before them a way of three days to search out a resting place for them; and the cloud of Jehovah was over them by day, when they journeyed from the camp. When the ark journeyed Moses said, Arise, O Jehovah, let Thine enemies be scattered, and let them that hate Thee flee from before Thy faces; and when it rested he said, Return, O Jehovah, to the myriads of the thousands of Israel (Num. 10:31–36). It is clear from these particulars that Jehovah or the Lord is here meant by “the ark” because of His presence in the law that was in the ark, thus because of His presence in the Word. Since the Lord is here meant by the law, and thus by the ark, “Moses said, Arise, O Jehovah, that Thine enemies be scattered, and let them that hate Thee flee from before Thy faces; and when it rested he said, Return, O Jehovah, to the myriads of the thousands of Israel.” But still more interior things are involved in these words, namely, that the Lord by His Divine truth leads men and defends them against falsities and evils, which are from hell, especially in temptations, which are signified in particular by the journeyings of the sons of Israel in the wilderness forty years. That the Lord leads men continually by His Divine truth is signified by “the ark of the covenant of Jehovah journeyed before them a way of three days to search out a resting place for them,” “the ark of Jehovah” meaning the Lord in relation to Divine truth, “journeying a way of three days” meaning His auspices and leading from beginning to end, and “searching out” signifying salvation, which is the end. [8] Moreover, protection from falsities and evils which are from hell is signified by “the cloud of Jehovah over them by day,” as well as by the words of Moses when the ark journeyed, “Arise, O Jehovah, let Thine enemies be scattered, and let them that hate Thee flee from before Thy faces”; “the cloud of Jehovah by day” signifies also protection by Divine truth in ultimates, such as the Word is in the sense of the letter, for by such truth the Lord can be approached even by the evil, and by it He defends the interior things of the Word, which are celestial and spiritual. (That this sense of the Word is signified by a “cloud” may be seen above, n. 594.) “Enemies” and “them that hate” signify falsities and evils that are from hell, “enemies” falsities, and “them that hate” evils, thus"

(That “myriads” are predicated of truths, and “thousands” of goods, see above, n. 336.)

Arise, O Jehovah, to Thy resting place, Thou and the ark of Thy strength. Let Thy priests be clothed with righteousness and let Thy saints shout for joy (Ps. 132:6–9). Evidently this Psalm treats of the Lord, who is here meant by “David,” as can be seen from its being said, “We have found Him in Ephrathah and in the fields of the forest,” also that “they bowed themselves down at His footstool”; “Ephrathah” meaning Bethlehem where the Lord was born, and signifying the Word in respect to its natural sense, while “Bethlehem” signifies the Word in respect to its spiritual sense; and there He chose to be born because the Lord is the Word; “the fields of the forest” signify the things of the natural sense of the Word, thus of the sense of the letter; while “His habitations” signify the spiritual sense of the Word, also heaven, since heaven is in that sense. The “footstool” to which they shall bow themselves down signifies the natural sense of the Word, and thence also the church on earth, since the church is in that sense.

The “priests who shall be clothed with righteousness” and the “saints who shall shout for joy,” have a similar signification as “the thousands and myriads of Israel,” “priests” meaning those who are in good, and “saints” those who are in truths, thus in an abstract sense the goods and truths of heaven and the church. (That “priests” in an abstract sense signify the goods of the church may be seen above, n. 31b at the end, and that “saints” in that sense signify the truths of the church, n. 204, 325a.) More about this psalm may be seen above (n. 684c). 700c. [11] Because the ark, from the law that was in it, signified the Lord in relation to Divine truth, and the Lord has omnipotence from Divine good through Divine truth, therefore by means of the ark miracles were wrought. Thus by means of it the waters of Jordan were divided, so that the sons of Israel passed over on dry ground; the wall of the city of Jericho was overthrown; Dagon, the god of the Ashdodites, fell down before it; the Ashdodites, the Gittites, the Ekronites, and the Bethshemites, were smitten with plagues on account of it; Uzzah died because he touched it; Obed- edom, into whose house it was brought, was blessed. As these historical facts involve arcana that can be opened only by the spiritual sense I also will explain them, that it may be known what the ark signifies in a strict sense and in a broad sense. First, respecting the division of the waters of Jordan that the sons of Israel might pass through on dry ground, in Joshua: Joshua and all the sons of Israel came to Jordan; and at the end of three days Joshua commanded, saying, When ye shall see the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, and the priests, the Levites, bearing it, ye shall journey from your place and shall go after it; yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand cubits; ye shall not draw near unto it. And the priests lifted up the ark of the covenant and went before the people. And Joshua said, When ye shall come to the brink of the waters of Jordan, ye shall stand still in Jordan. And he said unto the people, Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of the whole earth passing over before you into Jordan; and take ye twelve men of the tribes of Israel; and when the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the"

And it came to pass when the priests came unto Jordan, and the feet of the priests that bear the ark were dipped in the brink of the waters, and Jordan was full, as it was wont to be all the days of harvest, the waters that came down from above stood in one heap, stretching out very far from the city Adam; and those that came down upon the sea of the plain, the sea of salt, were completely cut off, so that the people could pass over towards Jericho. And the priests stood on the dry ground in the midst of Jordan; and all the people passed over on dry ground. Afterwards Jehovah said unto Joshua, Take to you twelve men, one of a tribe; and lift up out of the midst of Jordan, from where the priests’ feet stood, twelve stones, which ye shall bring over with you, and leave in the place where ye pass the night. And the sons of Israel did so; and they lifted up twelve stones out of the midst of Jordan, according to the numbers of the tribes of Israel, and they carried them over unto the place where they passed the night. Then after that all the people had finished passing over, the ark of Jehovah passed over, and the priests. And it came to pass when the priests were come up and the soles of their feet were plucked out, the waters of Jordan returned into their place. And the twelve stones which they took out of Jordan did Joshua set up in Gilgal (Josh. 3:1–17; 4:1–20). All the historicals of the Word, as well as its prophetical parts, contain a spiritual sense that treats, not of the sons of Israel and of nations and peoples, but of the church and its establishment and progress, for this is the spiritual of the Word, while the history is the natural that contains the spiritual. Therefore also all the miracles described in the Word, as the miracles done in Egypt and afterwards in the land of Canaan, involve such things as belong to heaven and the church, and for this reason also these miracles are Divine. [12] The miracle described above signifies the introduction of the faithful into the church, and through the church into heaven. “The sons of Israel” mean here in the spiritual sense the faithful, who after enduring temptations, which are signified by their wanderings in the wilderness, are brought into the church; for “the land of Canaan,” into which the sons of Israel were brought, signifies the church, and “Jordan” signifies the first entrance into it; and “the waters of Jordan” signify truths that introduce into it, which are"

But here “Jordan” and its waters signify the falsities of evil which conduct towards hell, since the land of Canaan was then filled with idolatrous nations, which signify evils and falsities of every kind, which constitute hell; for this reason these were to be driven out, that there might be a place for establishing the church. Because “the waters of Jordan” then signified the falsities of evil, they were parted and removed, to give a passage to the sons of Israel, who were to represent the church. [13] Now as the Lord alone removes and scatters the falsities of evil that are from hell, and by His Divine truths introduces the faithful into the church and into heaven, and as the ark and the law inclosed in it represented the Lord in relation to Divine truth, it was commanded that the ark should go before the people and thus lead them. This is why it came to pass that as soon as the priests bearing the ark dipped their feet in the waters of Jordan those waters were divided and went down, and the people passed over on dry land, and after this was done the waters returned. Then these same waters signified truths that introduce; for Jordan was the first boundary of the land of Canaan, and that land, when the sons of Israel had entered into it, represented the church, and that river introduction into it. [14] As the waters of Jordan signified truths that introduce they were commanded to take up out of the midst of it twelve stones, and carry them over to the first place where they passed the night, and this because “stones” signify truths, and “twelve stones according to the number of the tribes of Israel” signified the truths of the church. Joshua set up those stones in Gilgal to the east of Jericho, because “Gilgal” signified the doctrine of natural truth, which is serviceable for introduction into the church. From these few things it is clear what things of heaven and the church were represented by this miracle, also that the “ark,” because of the law in it, signified the Lord in relation to Divine truth, therefore it is called “the ark of the covenant of the Lord of the whole earth,” as meaning conjunction with the Lord through"

[15] The second miracle done by means of the ark was the overthrow of the wall of Jericho, which is thus described in Joshua: The city of Jericho was shut up; and Jehovah said unto Joshua, I have given into thy hand Jericho and the king thereof, and the mighty in valor. Ye shall compass the city, all the men of war, once a day for six days. And seven priests shall bear seven trumpets of jubilee before the ark; but the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven times, and the priests shall sound with the trumpets, and then the people shall shout with a great shout, and the wall of the city shall fall down from beneath itself; and the people shall go up. Then Joshua made them go round the city once the first day, as it had been said; after which circuit they returned into the camp, and passed the night in the camp; in like manner the day after. And the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of jubilee before the ark of Jehovah went on, going, and sounded the trumpets, before whom went the men of war, and the rear marching after the ark, going and sounding the trumpets. And so they did six days; and the seventh day they compassed the city seven times; and the seventh time the people shouted. And when the people heard this, then the wall of the city fell down beneath itself, and the people went up into the city, and gave to the curse all things which were in the city, from man even to woman, and from the boy to the old man. And they burned up the city with fire, and all things that were in it; only the silver and gold, and the vessels of brass and iron they put into the treasury of the house of Jehovah. And Joshua adjured them, saying, Cursed be the man before Jehovah that shall rise up and build this city; with his firstborn he shall lay the foundations of it, and with the youngest he shall set up its folding doors (Josh. 6:1–26). No one can know the Divine meaning contained in this miracle, unless he knows what is signified by “the city of Jericho” in the land of Canaan, which was burned up, by “its wall” which fell, by the “inhabitants” who were given to the curse, by “the gold and silver, and the vessels of brass and iron,” that were put into the treasury of the house of Jehovah, also by “sounding the trumpets and shouting,” and by “compassing it six days, and seven times on"

For all places in the land of Canaan were significative of things celestial and spiritual belonging to the church, and this from the most ancient times; and as the sons of Israel were to represent the church, and among them the Word was written, in which those places were to be mentioned signifying such things as are of heaven and the church, therefore the sons of Israel were introduced into it, and their introduction was signified by “the river Jordan,” and their instruction by “Jericho.” And as “Jericho” signified instruction it signified also the good of life, because unless one is in the good of life he cannot be instructed in the truths of doctrine. But when the land of Canaan was held by idolatrous nations the signification of the places and cities in that land was changed into the opposite, Jericho then signifying the profanation of truth and good. From this it follows that the “city” itself signified the doctrine of falsity and evil, which perverted and profaned the truths and goods of the church, its “wall” signifying falsities of evil defending that doctrine, and the “inhabitants” those who are profane; and as all profaneness is from infernal love after the acknowledgment of truth and good, therefore the city was burned with fire, the inhabitants given to the curse, and its wall fell down, “fire” signifying infernal love, “curse” a total blotting out, and “the falling down of the wall” exposure to every evil and falsity. [16] The sounding of the trumpets by the priests signified the proclamation of Divine truth from Divine good; the shouting and acclamation of the people signified consent and confirmation; compassing the city signified a survey of falsity and evil and their dispersion by the influx of Divine truth from the Lord; this influx was signified by carrying the ark about it. The priests were seven in number, and the city was compassed seven days, and seven times on the seventh day, to signify what is holy, and the holy proclamation of Divine truth, “seven” signifying holiness, and in the contrary sense profaneness, and as there was holiness on the one"

[17] The gold, the silver, and the vessels of brass and iron, were put into the treasury of the house of Jehovah, because these signified the knowledges of spiritual and natural truth and good, “gold and silver” the knowledges of spiritual truth and good, and “the vessels of brass and iron” knowledges of natural truth and good, which with those who profane are changed into direful falsities and evils; but as they continue to be knowledges, although applied to evils, they are serviceable to use with the good by application to what is good, and therefore these things were put into the treasury of the house of Jehovah. This also is what is meant by the “pounds” (minae) that were taken away from the evil and given to the good; likewise by the “unrighteous mammon”; also by “the gold, silver, and raiment,” that the sons of Israel took away from the Egyptians and afterwards devoted to the tabernacle; and also by “the gold and silver” that David gathered from the spoils of enemies, and left to Solomon for building the temple. [18] That he who rebuilt Jericho would be cursed, and that “he would lay the foundation of it with his firstborn, and set up its folding doors with his youngest,” signified the profanation of Divine truth from its first to its last, if instruction in it should be represented elsewhere than in Jerusalem, by which the church was signified in respect to the doctrine of truth and good, and in respect to instruction from the Word. That this profanation took place under King Ahab by Hiel the Bethelite is recorded in 1 Kings 16:34; and Ahab is said to have done evil in the eyes of Jehovah above all the kings of Israel (verses 30, 33). From this miracle done by means of the ark it can be seen that the ark, because of the law in it, represented the Lord in relation to Divine truth, and thence signified the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord. 700e. [19] The third miracle, that Dagon, the god of the Ashdodites, fell down before the ark, and the Ashdodites, Gittites, Ekronites, and Bethshemites were smitten with plagues because of it, is thus described in the first book of Samuel:"

Therefore the elders said, Let us take unto us out of Shiloh the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, and let it come into the midst of us, and deliver us out of the hand of the enemy. And they brought from thence the ark of the covenant of Jehovah of Hosts sitting above the cherubim, and with the ark the two sons of Eli. And it came to pass when the ark came to the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout; the Philistines heard, and knew that the ark of Jehovah was come to the camp, and they feared for themselves, saying, God is come to the camp; woe unto us! who shall deliver us out of the hands of these mighty gods? These are the gods that smote the Egyptians with every plague. But be strong and be men, O ye Philistines, that ye may not serve the Hebrews. And the Philistines fought, and Israel was beaten with a great slaughter, about thirty thousand footmen; and the ark of God was taken, and both the sons of Eli died. And the Philistines took the ark, and brought it down to Ashdod, into the house of Dagon, and they set it beside Dagon. When they of Ashdod rose in the morning, behold, Dagon lay upon his faces on the earth before the ark of Jehovah; and they put back Dagon again. But when they arose in the morning, Dagon lay upon his faces on the earth before the ark, and both the head of Dagon and the two palms of his hands lay cut off upon the threshold. And the hand of Jehovah was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and He smote them with emerods, Ashdod and the borders thereof. Then the men of Ashdod said, The ark of Israel shall not abide with us. Therefore the lords of the Philistines said, Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried over unto Gath. And they carried it over unto Gath. But the hand of Jehovah was against the city, and smote the men of the city from the least to the greatest, and emerods brake out upon them. So they sent the ark of God to Ekron. But the Ekronites cried out that they should be slain. And the men that died not were smitten with emerods. Therefore the lords said that they would send back the ark into its place. When the ark had remained in the field of the Philistines seven months, the Philistines called the priests and diviners, saying, What shall we do with the ark of Jehovah; how shall we send it back to its place? And they said, Send it not empty, but send it back with a guilt offering, then shall ye be healed, namely, according to the number of the lords of the Philistines, five emerods of gold and five mice of gold, for one plague is upon you all and upon your lords; ye shall make images of your emerods, and images of your mice, that have laid waste the land; and make a new cart, and two milch kine upon which there hath come no yoke, and tie the kine to the cart, and bring back their calves from them to the house, and put the ark of Jehovah upon the cart, and the vessels of gold put into a coffer at the side thereof; and see if it goeth up the way of the border to Bethshemesh. And they did so."

And the Levites set down the ark of Jehovah, and the coffer in which were the vessels of gold, upon that great stone; and the men of Bethshemesh offered burnt offerings, and sacrificed sacrifices to Jehovah. But the Bethshemites were smitten because they saw the ark of Jehovah, about fifty thousand and seventy men. But the men of Kiriath- jearim caused the ark of Jehovah to come up, and brought it into the house of Abinadab in Gibeah, and it remained there twenty years. Then Samuel said, If with the whole heart ye will return to Jehovah, put ye away the gods of the alien and Ashtaroth, and prepare your heart towards Jehovah, and serve Him only, then will He deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines (1 Sam. 4:1–11; 5:1–12; 6:1–21; 7:1–3). What is signified by all this—that the ark was taken by the Philistines, and the Philistines were smitten with emerods on account of the ark in Ashdod, Gath, and Ekron, also that mice laid waste their land, and that so many died there and in Bethshemesh—cannot be known unless it is known what the Philistines, and in particular the Ashdodites, Gittites, Ekronites, and Bethshemites, represented and thence signified; also what is signified by “emerods” and by “mice,” and by “the golden images” of these, and besides by the “new cart” and “the milch kine.” Evidently these are representatives of such things as belong to the church, for otherwise why should the Philistines have been smitten with such plagues, and the ark have been so brought back? [20] The Philistines represented, and thence signified, those who make no account of the good of love and charity, and thus no account of the good of life; placing everything of religion in knowledge and cognition; therefore they were like those at the present day who make faith alone, that is, faith separated from charity, the essential of the church and the essential of salvation. This is why they were called “the uncircumcised,” for to be uncircumcised signifies to be destitute of spiritual love, thus of good; and because they had reference to those within the church they were not spiritual, but merely natural, since he who makes no account of the good of charity and of life becomes merely natural, and even sensual, loving only worldly things, and is unable to"

Such are they who are meant in the Word by the “Philistines.” Thence it is evident why the Philistines so frequently fought with the sons of Israel, and that sometimes the Philistines conquered, and sometimes the sons of Israel. The Philistines conquered when the sons of Israel departed from the statutes and precepts in not doing them; but when the sons of Israel lived according to these they conquered. To live according to the precepts and statutes was their good of love and good of life. At this time the sons of Israel were conquered by the Philistines because they had departed from the worship of Jehovah to the worship of other gods, especially to the worship of Ashtaroth, as can be seen from what Samuel said to them (1 Sam. 7:3). For the same reason also the ark had been taken by the Philistines. [21] When it is known that the Philistines represented and thence signified those who make no account of the good of love, charity, and life, it can be known why because of the ark they were smitten with emerods and died in consequence; also why mice laid waste the land; for “emerods” signify truth defiled by such evil of life as is with those who are destitute of good; since “blood” signifies truth, and the corrupted blood from emerods truth defiled; and the hinder part, where the emerods were, signifies natural love, which with those not spiritual is the love of the world, while “mice” signify the falsities of the sensual man, which eat up and consume all things of the church, as mice lay waste fields and crops, and also the vegetables underground. Such were their plagues, because they were such, since those who are without good defile truths and also lay waste all things of the church. This was done on account of the ark, because the “ark” signified the Divine truth that proceeds from the Lord, and this cannot be genuine truth but with those who are in the good of love, and thence in the good of life; and when Divine truth flows in with those who are not in good it produces effects that correspond to their falsities of doctrine and evils of life, just as in the spiritual world, when Divine"

[22] Dagon the god of the Ashdodites, because of the nearness and presence of the ark, was cast down to the earth, and afterwards his head and the palms of his hands were cast upon the threshold of his temple, because “Dagon” signified their religion, which was wholly without intelligence and without power, because it was without spiritual good, “head” signifying intelligence, and “palms of the hands” power. It is similar in the spiritual world, when Divine truth inflows out of heaven with such persons, for they then appear as if they were without a head and without palms of the hands because they are without intelligence or power. [23] By the advice of their priests and diviners they made golden images of the emerods and mice, and set them at the side of the ark upon a new cart, to which they tied two milch kine on which no yoke had come, because “gold” signifies the good of love, which heals and purifies from falsities and evils, which are signified by the “emerods and mice,” also because a “cart” signifies the doctrine of natural truth, and a “new cart” that doctrine untouched and unpolluted by the falsities of their evil, and the “milch kine” on which no yoke had come signify natural good not yet defiled by falsities, for to bear a yoke signifies to serve, here to serve falsities which defile good; and as such good agrees with the Divine truth, which was signified by the “ark,” therefore these representatives were adapted and applied; and afterwards the Levites offered the kine as a burnt offering, which they burned with the wood of the cart. [24] The ark with the gifts was put on a great stone, near which the kine stood still, because a “stone” signifies Divine truth in the ultimate of order. The priests and diviners of the Philistines recommended this to be done because a knowledge of correspondences and representations was a common knowledge at that time, since it was their theology, known to the priests and diviners, who were their wise men.

[25] Fourth, the two miracles wrought by means of the ark, the death of Uzzah and the blessing of Obed-edom, are thus described in the second book of Samuel: David arose and went, and all the people that were with him, from Baal-Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God, whose name is called upon, the name of Jehovah of Hosts that sitteth upon the cherubim. And they caused the ark of God to be carried upon a new cart, and they brought it up out of the house of Abinadab, which was in Gibeah; and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, were leading the cart. And David and all the house of Israel were playing before Jehovah, upon instruments of fir wood of every kind, and upon harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with sistra, and with cymbals. And when they came to the threshing floor of Nachon, Uzzah put forth unto the ark and seized upon it, because the oxen stumbled; and the anger of Jehovah glowed against Uzzah, and God smote him for his error, so that he died there by the ark of God. And David was grieved at it, and David feared Jehovah that day, and he said, How shall the ark of Jehovah come unto me? And David would not remove the ark of Jehovah unto him in the city of David, but he turned it aside into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite. And the ark of Jehovah remained in his house three months, and Jehovah blessed Obed-edom and all his house; and it was told to King David; and David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-edom into the city of David with joy; and when they that bare the ark of Jehovah had gone six paces, he sacrificed an ox and a fatling; and David danced with all his strength before Jehovah, girt with a linen ephod. And David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of Jehovah with a shout and with the sound of a trumpet; and they brought the ark of Jehovah into the city of David, which is Zion, and set it up in its place within the tent that David had stretched out for it (2 Sam. 6:1–17). These historical facts in the internal or spiritual sense involve many things that cannot come into view in the sense of the letter, which is the historical sense; as what is involved in the fact that the ark was brought from the house of Abinadab into the house of Obed- edom, and at length into the city of David, which is Zion; in the fact that when it was brought they played and sounded all kinds of"

All these things, although historical, have concealed in their bosom such things as pertain to heaven and the church, in like manner as the ark itself, which, on account of the law in it, represented the Lord as to the Divine truth; therefore it is called “the ark of God whose name is called upon, the name of Jehovah of hosts that sitteth upon the cherubim.” That the ark was now brought out of the house of Abinadab, first into the house of Obed-edom and at length into the city of David, which is Zion, involves arcana that no one can know unless he knows what was signified by “Gibeah” and by “Baal-Judah” there, where Abinadab was, and by “Gath” where Obed-edom was, and finally by “Zion” where David was.

In the spiritual world in every region and also in every city those who are in the good of love dwell toward the east and the west, those who are in a bright good of love toward the east, and those who are in an obscure good of love toward the west; while toward the south and the north there those dwell who are in the light of truth; those who are in a bright light of truth toward the south and those who are in an obscure light of truth toward the north. The like is true of the land of Canaan and its regions and the cities of those regions; in reference to their quarters these corresponded to the regions of the spiritual world and to the cities of those regions; but with this difference, that on earth it is impossible so to arrange men in their quarters in respect to the good of love and the light of truth, as the spirits and angels are arranged in the spiritual world; consequently in the land of Canaan and its cities the places themselves represented, and not the persons.

[26] From the signification of these cities it can be seen that the transference of the ark represented the progress of the church with man, from its ultimate to its inmost, as from one heaven into another, even to the highest, which is the third heaven. “Baal- Judah,” where Abinadab was, signified the ultimate of the church, which is called its natural, for this was represented by “Gibeah,” where “Baal-Judah” was. But “Gath,” where Obed-edom was, who was therefore called a Gittite, signified the spiritual of the church; and this signification it took on after the sons of Israel had taken from the Philistines the cities from Ekron even to Gath (1 Sam. 7:13–15); while “Zion,” where David was, signified the inmost of the church, which is called its celestial.

Harmonies of musical sound are from the spiritual world, and signify the affections with their gladnesses and joys (as may be seen above, n. 323, 326). “Zion” signifies the third heaven, and thence the inmost of the church (see also above, n. 405b, e). [29] “The ark” brought on a new cart to which oxen were tied represented and thence signified the doctrine of truth from the good of love, “cart” signifying the doctrine of truth, and “oxen” the good of love, both in the natural man; for Divine truth, which is signified by the “ark,” rests and is founded upon the doctrine of natural truth which is from good; this is why the ark was set upon a cart before which were oxen.

Moreover, the cherubim that were over the mercy seat which was upon the ark, signified the guard that the Lord be not approached except through the good of love. That this was also done that David might not bring the ark into Zion before the progression which was being represented was finished (of which above) can be seen from this, that David grieved at the death of Uzzah, and feared to bring the ark into his city, which was Zion (verses 8–10)."

[32] Finally, bringing the ark into Zion and into the tent that David had stretched out for it, signified the ascent into the third heaven, and the conjunction of the Divine truth with the good of love, for “Zion” represented the inmost of the church, and thence the inmost of the heavens, which is the highest or third heaven, in which the angels are in the good of love to the Lord, and where there is a guard that the Lord be not approached except through the good of love, which guard was represented by the cherubim over the ark. 700g.

And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests lifted up the ark, and brought up the ark of Jehovah, and the tent of meeting, and all the vessels of holiness that were in the tent; and Solomon and all the congregation with him before the ark. And the priests brought the ark of the covenant of Jehovah into its place, into the adytum of the house, into the holy of holies, even under the wings of the cherubim; for the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, so that the cherubim covered the ark and the staves thereof from above, and the heads of the staves were seen from the holy place, toward the faces of the adytum, but they were not seen without. And Solomon said, There have I set a place for the ark, wherein is the covenant of Jehovah, which He made with our fathers when He brought them forth out of the land of Egypt (1 Kings 6:19, 23, 27, 28; 8:1–8, 21)."

But when the Lord came into the world, the externals that represented were abolished, for it was the Lord Himself that the representatives of the church shadowed forth and signified; and as these were external things, and as it were veilings, within which was the Lord, so when He came these veilings were taken away, and He was manifested, with heaven and the church, in which the Lord is the all in all. The primary representatives of the Lord, and thence of heaven and the church, were the tent of meeting with the table, the lamp stand, the altar of incense, and the ark there, also the altar with the burnt offerings and sacrifices, and afterwards the temple; the temple having a similar representation as the tent of meeting, with the difference that the tent of meeting was a more holy representative of the Lord, of heaven, and of the church, than the temple. [34] From this it can be seen that the adytum in the temple, where, like as in the tent of meeting, the ark was, represented the Lord in relation to the Divine truth, and thence the third heaven, where angels are conjoined to the Lord by love to Him, and consequently have Divine truth inscribed on their hearts.

[35] By the “ark,” moreover, the same as by “the continual sacrifice” in Daniel, which was to cease at the Lord’s coming into the world, a representative of the church in general is meant, in Jeremiah: I will give you shepherds according to My heart, that they may feed you with knowledge and intelligence; and it shall come to pass when ye shall be multiplied and bear fruit in the land, in those days they shall say no more, The ark of the covenant of Jehovah, neither shall it come up upon the heart, neither shall they make mention of it, neither shall they miss it, neither shall it be renewed anymore (Jer. 3:15, 16). This is said of the Lord’s coming, and of the abolition of the representative rites of the Jewish church at that time. That the interior things of the church that had been veiled over by external representative rites would then be manifested and there would then be interior or spiritual men, is signified by “shepherds would be given according to the heart of the Lord, and they shall feed them with knowledge and intelligence,” “shepherds” meaning those who teach good and lead to it by means of truths; the multiplication of truth and fructification of good are signified by “Then it shall come to pass when ye shall be multiplied and bear fruit in the land in those days”; that there will then be conjunction with the Lord through the interiors of the Word and not through its exteriors, which merely represented and signified things interior, is signified by, “they shall say no more, The ark of the covenant of Jehovah”; “the ark of the covenant of Jehovah” here signifying the externals of worship that were then to be abolished, the same as “the continual sacrifice” that was to cease (see Dan. 8:13; 11:31; 12:11).

As the ark is called “the ark of the covenant” it is also to be confirmed from the Word that it was called “the ark of the covenant” because the law was in it, and the “law,” which in a broad sense means the Word, signifies the Lord in relation to Divine truth, which is the Word, thus Divine truth or the Word which is from the Lord and in which is the Lord; for all Divine truth proceeds from Him, and when this is received by man conjunction with the Lord is effected, and this conjunction is what is signified by “covenant.” How conjunction of the Lord with man and of man with the Lord is effected, shall also be told in a few words. The Lord continually flows into all men with light that enlightens, and with the affection of knowing and understanding truths, also for willing and doing them; and as that light and that affection continually flow in from the Lord, it follows that man becomes rational to the extent that he receives of that light, and he becomes wise and is led by the Lord so far as he receives of that affection. That affection with its light draws to itself and con joins to itself the truths that man from infancy has learned from the Word, from doctrine out of the Word, and from preaching; for every affection desires to be nourished by the knowledges that are in harmony with it. From this conjunction man’s spiritual love or affection is formed, through which he is conjoined to the Lord, that is, through which the Lord conjoins man to Himself."

From freedom a man can think and will what is evil, and can also think and will what is good. So far, therefore, as from that freedom, which belongs to his love and thence to his life, man thinks falsities and wills evils, which are the opposites of the truths and goods of the Word, so far he is not conjoined to the Lord; but so far as he thinks truths and wills goods, which are from the Word, so far he is conjoined to the Lord, and the Lord makes those truths and goods to be of his love, and thence of his life. From this it is evident that this conjunction is reciprocal, namely, of the Lord with man and of man with the Lord; such is the conjunction that is meant in the Word by “covenant.” [3] He greatly errs who believes that man is incapable of doing anything for his own salvation because the light to see truths and the affection of doing them, as well as the freedom to think and will them, are from the Lord, and nothing of these from man. Because these appear to man to be as if in himself, and when they are thought and willed to be as from himself, man ought, because of that appearance, to think and will them as if from himself, but at the same time acknowledge that they are from the Lord. In no other way can anything of truth and good or of faith and love be appropriated to man. If one lets his hands hang down and waits for influx he receives nothing, and can have no reciprocal conjunction with the Lord, thus he is not in the covenant. That this is so is clearly evident from this, that the Lord in a thousand passages in the Word has taught that man must do good and must not do evil, and this the Lord would by no means have said, unless something had been given to man by which he has ability to do, and unless that which has been given to man might seem to him to be as if his own, although it is not his. Because this is so the Lord speaks thus in John:"

[4] That “covenant” signifies conjunction with the Lord through the reception of Divine truth by the understanding and will, or by the heart and soul, that is, by love and faith, and that this conjunction is effected reciprocally, can be seen from the Word where “covenant” is mentioned. For from the Word it is evident: (1) That the Lord Himself is called a “covenant,” because conjunction with Him is effected by Him through the Divine that proceeds from Him. (2) That the Divine proceeding, which is Divine truth, thus the Word, is the covenant, because it conjoins. (3) That the commandments, judgments, and statutes com- manded to the sons of Israel were to them a covenant, because through these there was then conjunction with the Lord. (4) And further, that whatever conjoins is called a “covenant.” [5] As to the first: That the Lord Himself is called a “covenant,” because conjunction with Him is effected by Him through the Divine that proceeds from Him, is evident from the following passages. In Isaiah: I Jehovah have called Thee in righteousness, and I will take hold of Thine hand and will guard Thee, and I will give thee for a covenant of the people and for a light of the nations (Isa. 42:6). This is said of the Lord, who is called “a covenant of the people and a light of the nations,” because a “covenant” signifies conjunction, and “light” Divine truth; “peoples” mean those who are in truths, and “nations” those who are in goods (see above, n. 175, 331, 625); “to call Him in righteousness” signifies to establish righteousness by separating the evil from the good and by saving"

[6] In the same: I have given Thee for a covenant of the people, to restore the earth and to inherit the wasted heritages (Isa. 49:8). This, too, is said of the Lord; and “to give for a covenant of the people” signifies that there may be conjunction with Him and by Him; “to restore the earth” signifies the church; and “to inherit the wasted heritages” signifies to restore the goods and truths of the church that have been destroyed. [7] In David: I have made a covenant with My chosen, and I have sworn to David My servant, even to eternity will I establish thy seed, to eternity will I keep for him My mercy, and My covenant shall be steadfast for Him (Ps. 89:3, 4, 28). “David” here means the Lord in relation to His royalty (see above, n. 205), and he is called “chosen” from good, and “servant” from truth; “to make a covenant and swear to him” signifies the uniting of the Lord’s Divine with His Human, “to make a covenant” meaning to become united, and “to swear” meaning to confirm it; “even to eternity will I establish thy seed” signifies the eternity of Divine truth from Him; “to eternity will I keep for him My mercy” signifies the eternity of Divine good from Him; “My covenant shall be steadfast” signifies the union of the Divine and Human in Him. This becomes the sense of these words when, instead of David, the Lord in relation to the Divine Human and its royalty is understood, respecting which this is said in the sense of the letter, because in that sense David is treated of, with whom there was no eternal covenant.

Is not my house firm with God? For He hath set for me a covenant of eternity, to order over all and to keep (2 Sam. 23:3–5). This is said by David; and “the God of Israel” and “the rock of Israel” mean the Lord in relation to Divine truth; what is signified by “He shall be as light in the morning when the sun riseth, a morning without clouds, from the brightness after rain cometh grass out of the earth,” may be seen above (n. 644c). This describes Divine truth proceeding from the Lord, from which is all germination of truth and fructification of good. “Is not my house firm with God?” signifies the church conjoined with the Lord through the Divine truth, “the house of David” meaning the church; “for He hath set for me a covenant of eternity” signifies that from the union of His Human with the Divine He has conjunction with the men of the church; “to order over all and to keep” signifies from which He rules over all things and all persons, and saves such as receive. [9] In Malachi: Ye shall know that I have sent this commandment unto you, that My covenant may be with Levi. My covenant with him was of life and of peace, which I gave to him with fear, that he might fear Me. The law of truth was in his mouth, and perversity was not found in his lips. But ye have turned aside out of the way, ye have caused many to stumble in the law, ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi (Mal. 2:4–6, 8). “The covenant of Jehovah with Levi” signifies in the highest sense the union of the Divine with the Human in the Lord, and in a relative sense, the Lord’s conjunction with the church; for by “Levi” as by “David” the Lord is meant, but “Levi” means the Lord in relation to Divine good, which is the priesthood of the Lord, and “David” in relation to Divine truth, which is the royalty of the Lord. That the Lord is meant by “Levi” is evident from its being said, “the law of truth was in his mouth, and perversity was not found in his lips,” “the law of truth” signifying Divine truth from"

What is signified by “His fear” may be seen above (n. 696). Those who live contrary to Divine truth are meant by “ye have turned aside out of the way, ye have caused many to stumble in the law, ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi”; “to turn aside out of the way and to stumble in the law” signifies to live contrary to Divine truth, and “to corrupt the covenant of Levi” signifies to corrupt conjunction with the Lord. [10] In the same: Behold, I send My messenger, and he shall prepare the way before Me; and the Lord shall suddenly come to His temple; and the angel of the covenant whom ye desire (Mal. 3:1). It is evidently the Lord’s coming that is here proclaimed. The Lord is here called “Lord” from Divine good, and “the angel of the covenant” from Divine truth (as may be seen above, n. 242d, 433b, 444b, where the rest of the passage is explained). From this it can be seen that “covenant,” in reference to the Lord, means either Himself or the union of His Divine with the Human in Him, and in reference to those who are in heaven and in the church it means conjunction with Him through the Divine that proceeds from Him. 701c. [11] Secondly, that the Divine proceeding, which is Divine truth, thus the Word, is the covenant, because it conjoins, can be seen from the following passages. In Moses:"

And all the people answered with one voice and said, All the words which Jehovah hath spoken will we do. And Moses wrote all the words of Jehovah in a book. And he took the book of the covenant, and read in the ears of the people; and they said, All that Jehovah hath spoken we will do and will hearken. And Moses took half of the blood of the burnt offerings, and sprinkled upon the people, and said, Behold, the blood of the covenant that Jehovah hath concluded with you upon all these words. And they saw the God of Israel, and under His feet as it were a work of sapphire stone (Exod. 24:3, 4, 7, 8, 10). That Divine truth which with us is the Word is a covenant, is evident from all these particulars regarded in the internal or spiritual sense; for Moses, who said these things to the people, represented the law, that is, the Word, as can be seen from various places where it is said, “Moses and the prophets,” and elsewhere “the law and the prophets”; thus “Moses” stands for the law, and the law in a broad sense signifies the Word, which is Divine truth. The same may also be evident from this, that “Mount Sinai” signifies heaven, from which is Divine truth; likewise from this, that “the book of the covenant, which was read before the people,” signifies the Word; also that the “blood,” half of which was sprinkled upon the people, also signifies Divine truth, which is the Word, and as this conjoins, it is called “the blood of the covenant.” Again, since all conjunction through Divine truth is conjunction with the Lord, “the God of Israel,” who is the Lord, was seen by Moses, Aaron and his sons, and the seventy elders. What was “under His feet” was seen, because when “the Lord” means the Word, “His feet” mean the Word in its ultimates, that is, in the sense of its letter, for the sons of Israel did not see the Word interiorly; “as it were a work of sapphire stone” signifies to be transparent from internal truths, which are the spiritual sense of the Word. (But this may be seen explained in detail in Arcana Coelestia, n. 9371–9412.) [12] Of what nature the conjunction is that is signified by “covenant” can be seen from what has been set forth, namely, that it is like the covenants commonly made in the world, that is, on the"

The things on the Lord’s part are stated in the preceding chapter, namely: That He will bless their bread and their waters, that He will take away their diseases, and that they shall possess the land of Canaan from the Sea Suph even to the river Euphrates (Exod. 23:25–31). Here “to bless the bread and the waters” signifies in the internal spiritual sense the fructification of good and the multiplication of truth, “bread” signifying every good of heaven and the church, and “waters” all the truths of that good; “to take away diseases” signifies to remove evils and falsities which are from hell, for these are diseases in the spiritual sense; “to possess the land from the Sea Suph to the river Euphrates” signifies the church in all its extension, which those have from the Lord who are conjoined to Him through Divine truth. But the things that must be on man’s part are recounted in the three preceding chapters, and in brief are meant in the passage cited above by “the words and judgments of Jehovah” that Moses coming down from Mount Sinai declared to the people, to which the people, with one voice said, “All the words that Jehovah hath spoken we will do and will hearken.” It was for this reason that Moses divided the blood of the burnt offerings, and half of it, which was for the Lord, he left in the bowls, but the other half he sprinkled upon the people. [13] That the conjunction of the Lord with men is effected through Divine truth is also meant by “blood” in the Gospels: Jesus took the cup, saying, Drink ye all of it; this is My blood, that of the new covenant (Matt. 26:27, 28; Mark 14:23, 24; Luke 22:20). This blood is called “the blood of the new covenant,” because “blood” signifies the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord, and “covenant” signifies conjunction.

[14] Likewise in Zechariah: By the blood of thy covenant I will send forth thy bound out of the pit wherein is no water (Zech. 9:11). This is said of the Lord, who is plainly treated of in this chapter; and “the blood of the covenant” means, as above, the Divine truth, by which there is conjunction with the Lord. Who are meant by “those bound in the pit wherein is no water” can be seen above (n. 537b ). [15] As the Lord called His blood, meaning the Divine truth proceeding from Him, “the blood of the new covenant,” it shall be said briefly what is meant by “the old covenant” and “the new covenant.” “The old covenant” means conjunction through such Divine truth as was given to the sons of Israel, which was external, and therefore representative of internal Divine truth. They had no other Divine truth, because they could not receive any other, for they were external and natural men, and not internal or spiritual, as can be seen from the fact that such as knew anything about the Lord’s coming had no other thought of Him than that He was to be a king who would raise them above all the peoples in the whole world, and thus establish a kingdom with them on the earth, and not in the heavens and therefrom on the earth with all who believe on Him. “The old covenant,” therefore, was a conjunction through such Divine truth as is contained in the books of Moses and is called “commandments, judgments, and statutes,” in which, nevertheless, there lay inwardly hidden such Divine truth as is in heaven, which is internal and spiritual. This Divine truth was disclosed by the Lord when He was in the world; and as through this alone there is conjunction of the Lord with men, therefore this is what is meant by “the new covenant,” also by “His blood,” which is therefore called “the blood of the new covenant.” “Wine” has a similar meaning."

      "text": "APOCALYPSE EXPLAINED 2412 [16] This “new covenant,” which was to be entered into with the Lord when He should come into the world, is sometimes treated of in the Word of the old covenant. Thus in Jeremiah: Behold the days come in which I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah, not as the covenant which I made with your fathers, for they have made My covenant void. But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after these days; I will give My law in the midst of them, and will write it upon their heart, and I will be to them for God, and they shall be to Me for a people; neither shall they teach anymore a man his companion, a man his brother, saying, Know ye Jehovah, for all shall know Me, from the least of them even to the greatest of them (Jer. 31:31–34). That Jehovah, that is, the Lord, “was to make a new covenant with the house of Israel and house of Judah” does not mean that it was to be made with the sons of Israel and with Judah, but with all who from the Lord are in the truths of doctrine and in the good of love to the Lord. That these are meant in the Word by “the sons of Israel” and by “Judah” may be seen above (n. 433); that “the days come” means the Lord’s coming is evident. That there would then be conjunction with the Lord through Divine truth, internal and spiritual, is meant by the words, “This is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after these days, I will give My law in the midst of them, and will write it upon their heart.” This signifies that they would then receive Divine truth inwardly in themselves; for spiritual Divine truth is received by man inwardly, thus otherwise than with the sons of Israel and the Jews, who received it outwardly; for when a man receives Divine truth inwardly in himself, that is, makes it to be of his love and thus of his life, truth is known from the truth itself, because the Lord flows into His own truth with man, and teaches him; this is what is meant by the words, “they shall no more teach a man his companion, and a man his brother, saying, Know ye Jehovah, for all shall know Me, from the least even to the greatest.” The conjunction itself thereby effected, which “the new covenant” signifies, is meant by “I will be to them for God, and they shall be to Me for a people.” [17] In the same:"

This, too, is said of the Lord and of the new covenant with Him; conjunction thereby is meant by “I will be to them for God, and they shall be to me for a people,” and is further described by this, that “He would give to them one heart and one way, to fear Him all the days,” and that “He would not turn Himself back from them, and that He would put fear into their heart that they might not depart from Him”; “one heart and one way to fear Me” signifies one will of good and one understanding of truth for worshiping the Lord; and as the conjunction is reciprocal, that is, a conjunction of the Lord with them and of them with the Lord, it is said that He will not turn Him back from them “that I may do them good, and they will not depart from Me.” From this it is clear what is signified by “the eternal covenant” that He will enter into with them, namely, conjunction through spiritual Divine truth, which truth, when received, constitutes the life of man, and from it comes eternal conjunction.

Then will I make with them a covenant of peace, I will cause the evil wild beast to cease that they may dwell securely in the wilderness, and sleep in the forests (Ezek. 34:23–25). This also is said of the Lord; and “David,” who shall feed them and who shall be a prince in the midst of them, means the Lord in relation to the Divine truth, who is called a servant from serving; conjunction with the Lord through the Divine truth is meant by “the covenant” which He will make with them; this is called “a covenant of peace,” because man by conjunction with the Lord has"

[19] In the same: My servant David shall be a king over them, that they all may have one shepherd. And I will make a covenant of peace with them, it shall be a covenant of eternity with them; and I will give them and multiply them, and I will set My sanctuary in the midst of them to eternity, and My habitation with them; and I will be to them for God, and they shall be to Me for a people (Ezek. 37:24, 26, 27). Here also by “David” the Lord is meant, for it is evident that David was not to come again to be their king and shepherd; but the Lord is called “king” from Divine truth, for this is the royalty of the Lord, while Divine good is His priesthood; and the Lord is called “shepherd,” because He will feed them with Divine truth, and thereby lead to the good of love, and thus to Himself; and because from this there is conjunction it is said, “I will make with them a covenant of peace, a covenant of eternity.” What “a covenant of peace” signifies has been told just above, also that “I will be to them for God, and they shall be to Me for a people,” means conjunction. The “sanctuary” that He will set in the midst of them, and the “habitation” that will be with them, signify heaven and the church, that are called a “sanctuary” from the good of love, and a “habitation” from the truths of that good, for the Lord dwells in truths from good.

This treats of the establishment of a new church by the Lord. It is clear that the Lord would not then make a covenant with the wild beast of the field, with the bird of the heavens, and with the creeping thing of the earth, therefore these signify such things as are with man; “the wild beast of the field” signifying the affection of truth and good, “the bird of the heavens” spiritual thought, and “the creeping thing of the earth” the knowledge of the natural man. (What the rest signifies may be seen above, n. 650e.) This makes evident that the covenant the Lord will make is a spiritual covenant, or a covenant through spiritual truth, and not a covenant through natural truth such as was made with the sons of Israel; this latter was “the old covenant,” the former was “the new covenant.” [21] As “the law” that was promulgated by the Lord from Mount Sinai meant in a broad sense the Word, so also the tables on which that law was written are called “tables of the covenant” in Moses: I went up into the mount to receive the tables of stone, the tables of the covenant which Jehovah made with you. At the end of forty days and forty nights Jehovah gave to me the two tables of stone, the tables of the covenant (Deut. 9:9, 11). These “tables,” that is, the law written upon them, mean the Divine truth, through which there is conjunction with the Lord, and because of that conjunction they are called “the tables of the covenant”; and as all conjunction, like a covenant, is effected from the part of one and the part of the other, thus in turn on the one side and on the other, so there were two tables, and these were of stone; they were of stone because “stone” signifies the Divine truth in ultimates (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 643, 3720, 6426, 8609, 10376). For the same reason the ark in which these tables were placed was called “the ark of the covenant,” and with the sons of Israel this was the most holy thing of their worship, as has been shown in the preceding article."

[22] Thirdly, that the commandments, judgments, and statutes commanded to the sons of Israel were to them a covenant, because through these there was then conjunction with the Lord, can be seen from the following passages. In Moses: If ye walk in My statutes, and keep My commandments and do them, I will have respect unto you, and will make you fruitful and multiply you, and I will establish My covenant with you. But if ye reject My statutes, so that ye do not all My commandments, whilst ye make My covenant void, I will do to you the opposite (Lev. 26:3, 9, 15 seq.). The statutes and commandments that were to be observed and done are set forth in the preceding chapter, and the goods they were to enjoy if they kept those commandments and statutes, and afterwards the evils that would come upon them if they did not keep them are set forth in this chapter. But the goods they were to enjoy were earthly and worldly goods, so too were the evils, because they were earthly and natural men, and not celestial and spiritual men, and consequently they knew nothing about the goods that affect man inwardly or the evils that afflict him inwardly; nevertheless the externals they were bound to observe were such as inwardly contained celestial and spiritual things, through which there is conjunction itself with the Lord; and as these were perceived in heaven, therefore the externals that the sons of Israel were to observe were called a “covenant.” (But what the conjunction was of the Lord with the sons of Israel through these means may be seen in the New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine, n. 248.) [23] “Covenant” has a like meaning in the following passages. In Moses: Jehovah said unto Moses, Write thou these words, for upon the mouth of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel (Exod. 34:27). Keep the words of this covenant and do them, ye that stand here this day, your heads, your tribes, your officers, and every man of Israel, to pass over into the covenant of Jehovah and into His oath which Jehovah thy God maketh with thee this day, that He may establish thee this day for a people, and that He may be to thee for God; not with you"

So, too, in other passages (Jer. 22:8, 9; 33:20–22; 50:5; Ezek. 16:8; Mal. 2:14; Ps. 78:37; 50:5, 16; 103:17, 18; 105:8, 9; 106:45; 111:5, 9; Deut. 17:2; 1 Kings 19:14). In all these passages “covenant” is mentioned, and by it the externals that the sons of Israel were to observe are meant. [24] But as regards the covenant that the Lord made with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, this was not the same as the covenant He made with the posterity of Jacob, but it was a covenant on the part of the Lord that their seed should be multiplied, and to their seed the land of Canaan should be given, and on the part of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, that every male should be circumcised. That the covenant with the posterity of Jacob was different is evident in Moses: Jehovah our God made with us a covenant in Horeb; Jehovah made not this covenant with our fathers, but with us (Deut. 5:2, 3). Regarding the former covenant it is written in Moses: Jehovah brought Abraham forth abroad, and said, Look toward heaven and number the stars; and He said to him, So shall thy seed be. And He said to him, Take to thee57 a heifer of three years old, and a she-goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.

And the sun went down and it became very dark; and behold a furnace of smoke and a torch of fire passed through between the pieces. In that day Jehovah made a covenant with Abraham58 saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river Euphrates (Gen. 15:5–18). And afterwards: I will give My covenant between Me and thee, and I will multiply thee exceedingly. I, behold, My covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be for a father of a multitude of nations, and I will make thee fruitful; and I will give to thee and to thy seed after thee the land of thy sojournings, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession. This is My covenant that ye shall keep between Me and you and thy seed after thee. Every male shall be circumcised to you; he who is not circumcised in the flesh of the foreskin, that soul shall be cut off from his peoples, he hath made void My covenant. And My covenant will I set up with Isaac, whom Sarah shall bear to thee (Gen. 17:1–21). From this it is clear what kind of a covenant was entered into with Abraham, namely, that “his seed should be multiplied exceedingly, and that the land of Canaan should be given to his seed for a possession.” The commandments, judgments, and statutes themselves by which the covenant was to be established are not mentioned, but still they are signified by “the heifer, she-goat, and ram of three years old,” and by “the turtledove and young pigeon,” for these animals signify such things as belong to the church, and “the land of Canaan” itself signifies the church. And because the Lord foresaw that the posterity of Abraham from Jacob would not keep the covenant, there appeared to Abraham “a furnace of smoke and a torch of fire passing through between the pieces”; “a furnace of smoke” signifying the dense falsity, and “the torch of fire” the direful evil into which the posterity of Jacob would come. This is confirmed also in Jeremiah 33:18–20. “Abraham divided the heifer, the she-goat, and the ram, and laid each part over against the other,” according to the ritual of covenants between two parties. (But this may be seen fully explained in Arcana Coelestia, n. 1783–1862.) [25] The covenant was made by circumcision because circumcision represented the purification from the loves of self and"

(But the particulars recorded in that chapter respecting this covenant are explained in Arcana Coelestia, n. 1987–2095; and respecting circumcision, n. 2039 at the end, 2046 at the end, 2632, 2799, 4462, 7044, 8093.) But as “Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,” mean in the internal sense the Lord, so “their seed” signify all who are of the Lord’s church, which church is meant by “the land of Canaan,” which their seed was to inherit. [26] There was also a covenant entered into with Noah: That men should no more perish by the waters of a flood, and that a bow should be in the cloud for a sign of that covenant (Gen. 6:17, 18; 9:9, 17). Conjunction of the Lord through Divine truth is involved also in that covenant, as can be seen from the explanation of the above in Arcana Coelestia (n. 659–675, 1022–1059). That “the bow in the cloud,” or the rainbow, here signifies regeneration, which is effected by Divine truth and a life according to it, and that consequently that bow was taken for a sign of the covenant, may also be seen in the same work (n. 1042). 701e. [27] Fourth, That further, whatever conjoins is called a covenant; as the Sabbath in Moses: The sons of Israel shall keep the Sabbath in their generations, the covenant of an age (Exod. 31:16). The Sabbath was called “the covenant of an age,” because the “Sabbath” signified in the highest sense the union of the Divine with the Human in the Lord, and in a relative sense the conjunction of the Lord with heaven and the church, and in a universal sense the conjunction of good and truth, which conjunction is called the heavenly marriage.

[28] Again, the salt in the sacrifices is called “the salt of the covenant” in Moses: Thou shalt not cause the salt of the covenant of thy God to cease upon thine offering, upon all thine offering thou shalt offer salt (Lev. 2:13). The salt upon the offering is called “the salt of the covenant,” because “salt” signifies the desire of truth for good, whereby the two are conjoined. (On this signification of “salt” see Arcana Coelestia, n. 9207.) [29] A wife is called “the wife of a covenant” in Malachi: Jehovah hath been a witness between thee and the wife of thy youth, against whom thou hast dealt treacherously, though she is thy companion and the wife of thy covenant (Mal. 2:14). A wife is here called “the wife of the covenant” from her conjunction with her husband, but “wife” here signifies the church, and “the wife of youth” the ancient church, against which the Jewish church is said to have dealt treacherously. Because these were both representative churches, and in this respect alike, and thus were conjoined, it is said, “though she is thy companion and the wife of thy covenant.” [30] “A covenant with the stones of the field” is spoken of in Job: Thou shalt not be afraid of the wild beast of the field, for with the stones of the field is thy covenant, and the wild beast of the field shall be at peace with thee (Job 5:22, 23)."

[31] Again, “a covenant with wild beasts and birds” is spoken of in Hosea: In that day will I make a covenant for them with the wild beast of the field, with the bird of the heavens, and with the creeping thing of the earth (Hos. 2:18). And in Moses: God said unto Noah, Behold I establish My covenant with you and with every living soul that is with you, the bird, the beast, and every wild beast of the earth with you, of all that go out of the ark, even every wild beast of the earth (Gen. 9:9, 10). “A covenant with beast, wild beast, bird and creeping thing of the earth,” signifies conjunction with such things with man as are signified by these, for “beast” signifies the affection of good, “wild beast” the affection of truth, “bird” the thinking faculty, and “creeping thing of the earth” the knowing faculty which lives from these affections. [32] “A covenant with death” is spoken of in Isaiah: Ye have said, We have made a covenant with death, and with hell we have made vision. Your covenant with death shall be abolished, and your vision with hell shall not stand (Isa. 28:15, 18). “To make a covenant with death” signifies conjunction through falsity from hell, from which man dies spiritually; “to make a vision with hell” signifies divination from hell as if prophetic.

In a strict sense “lightnings” signify the darkenings of the understanding, “voices” reasonings, and “thunders” conclusions respecting falsity from evil, and because from these, according to the state of the interiors with them there then arise conflicts and disturbances of the affections and thoughts, and consequent reasonings from evils and falsities respecting the goods and truths of the church, therefore from logical connection with what precedes, this is what these words signify.

[2] In the spiritual world, by which are meant both the heavens and the hells, the arrangement is such that the heavens are like expanses one above another, and under the heavens is the world of spirits, and under this are the hells, one below another. Influx from the Lord takes place according to this consecutive arrangement, thus through the inmost heaven into the middle, and through this into the lowest, and from these in their order into the hells which lie beneath. The world of spirits is between, and receives influx both from the heavens and from the hells, each one there according to the state of his life. [3] But this arrangement of the heavens and of the hells underwent changes from one judgment to another, for the reason that the men who arrived from the earth, of whom the heavens and the hells are constituted, had various affections, some more or less spiritual or internal, and some more or less natural or external. And as the Lord does evil to no one, but good to all, He permitted those who had lived a moral and as it were spiritual life in externals from custom and habit in the world, however interiorly they were conjoined with hell, to form for themselves in the world of spirits a similitude of heaven in various places; and then the heavens above them and the hells below them were so arranged that their interiors through which they were conjoined with hell might be as far as possible kept closed, while their exteriors through which they were conjoined with the lowest heaven were kept open. And then it was provided that the higher heavens should not flow in immediately, because by immediate influx their interiors which were infernal would be opened, and their exteriors which were as it were spiritual would be closed; for the influx of the higher heavens is into the interiors, which are properly the spirits’ own, and not into the exteriors, which are not properly their own.

From this then it is clear why it was that the “temple” appeared, and “the ark in the temple,” which signifies the Divine truth by which the higher heavens were enlightened from which influx might come into the lower parts where the evil were. From this influx it came to pass that, in the lower parts where the evil were, lightnings were seen, and voices and thunders were heard, also there was an earthquake, and hail fell. The influx out of the heavens, that is, through the heavens from the Lord, is nothing else than an influx of the love of good and the affection of truth, but with the evil this is turned into such things as correspond to their evils and to the falsities therefrom, thus that correspond to their love of evil and affection of falsity; and as conflicts and disturbances of the thoughts and reasonings from the evils and falsities respecting the goods and truths of the church in which they were correspond to lightnings, voices, and thunders, therefore they are signified by these; for the state of heaven, what it was to be immediately before the last judgment, is what is here treated of. The conflicts and disturbances of the thoughts and the reasonings from evils and falsities respecting the goods and truths of the church that arise with those who are inwardly evil but who outwardly appear good, when their interiors have been opened and their exteriors closed, are from the conflict of their interiors with their exteriors in the first stage of separation; but as soon as the exteriors have been wholly closed and they have been left to their own interiors the conflict ceases, for then they are completely in the love of their own evil and in the affection of their own falsity, and thus in the delight of their life.

That in the spiritual world there are lands, hills, and mountains, and that these are shaken when the state of the church with them is changed into evil and falsity, and that these are the earthquakes meant by the “earthquakes” spoken of in the Word, may also be seen above (n. 400, 499). 704. And great hail, signifies infernal falsity destroying the truths and goods of the church. This is evident from the signification of “hail,” as being infernal falsity destroying the truths of the church (of which above, n. 503); and as it is called a “great hail,” and “great” is predicated of good, and “many” of truth (see above, n. 652a, 696), so “great hail” signifies also infernal falsity destroying the goods of the church. Besides lightnings, thunders, and an earthquake, great hail also was seen, because in the spiritual world there appear all the things that are in the natural world, as mists, clouds, rains, snow, and hail, and these though appearances are nevertheless real, arising from correspondences; for the celestial and spiritual Divine things that belong to the affections and the thoughts therefrom, thus to the good of love and the truth of that good with angels, when they descend into the next lower sphere put on forms like those of natural things, and thus present themselves before the eyes to be seen; thus correspondences are formed. So is it with lightnings, thunders, and hail. For this hail is formed by the flowing down of Divine truth where the evil are, who by reasonings draw false conclusions, and by these oppose truths and destroy them. For when Divine truth flows down out of the heavens into the sphere that is about the evil and that appears like a mist formed from their evil affections and from the resulting falsities of their thoughts, then that influx is turned into various things, and into hail with those who think from evils and falsities in opposition to the goods and truths of heaven and the church, and who violently assault them. The reason of this is that their affections and the thoughts therefrom, which are of falsity against truths, are destitute of all heavenly heat; therefore the rain which also falls down out of the heavens into the lower parts congeals into snow or into hail, and that hail destroys all things with them that"

Moreover, the hail appears congealed into larger or smaller grains according to their stronger or milder attacks upon truths by falsities; the larger grains are called in the Word “hailstones,” because “stones” also signify falsities.

Verse 1. And a great sign was seen in heaven, signifies Divine attestation respecting the coming church and the reception of its doctrine, and by whom it will be assaulted. This is evident from the signification of “a great sign in heaven,” as being Divine manifestation and attestation; that it has reference to the church and the reception of its doctrine, and also to assault upon it, is evident from what follows, for the “woman” means the church, her “son a male” doctrine, and “the dragon and his angels” and afterwards “the beasts,” mean those who will assault the church and its doctrine. This vision is called “a great sign” because a “sign” means Divine manifestation respecting things to come, and attestation, here respecting the coming church and its doctrine, and also the assault upon it by those who are meant by “the dragon” and “the beasts.” This is called a “sign,” because it manifests and attests. “Sign” and “wonder” are mentioned in many passages in the Word, “sign” meaning that which indicates, witnesses, and persuades respecting the subject of inquiry, and “wonder” meaning that which stirs up, strikes dumb, and fills with amazement; thus a sign moves the understanding and faith, but a wonder the will and its affection, for the will and its affection are what are stirred up, stricken dumb, and filled with amazement, while the understanding and its faith are what are persuaded and moved by indications and proofs. [2] That there is a difference between a sign and a wonder is evident from the fact that the Jews, although they had seen so many wonders performed by the Lord, still sought signs from Him; and also from the fact that the prodigies wrought in Egypt and in the wilderness are sometimes called “signs” and sometimes “wonders,” and sometimes both.

In Moses: I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, that I may multiply My signs and My wonders in the land of Egypt (Exod. 7:3). Jehovah gave signs and wonders great and evil upon Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his men4 (Deut. 6:22). Hath Jehovah tried to come to take to Him a nation out of the midst of a nation, by wonders, by signs, and by prodigies? (Deut. 4:34) In David: They remembered not the day in which Jehovah set His signs in Egypt, and His prodigies in the field of Zoan (Ps. 78:42, 43). They set among them the words of their5 signs and wonders in the land of Ham (Ps. 105:27). He sent signs and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt, upon Pharaoh and all his servants (Ps. 135:9). In Jeremiah: Who hast set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, and even to this day, both in Israel and in men, and hast led forth Thy people Israel out of the land of Egypt by signs and by wonders (Jer. 32:20, 21).

Here “great signs and wonders” have a like signification, namely, that they will attest and persuade, and that they will strike dumb and fill with amazement, which will cause a strong persuasion. Who are meant by “false Christs and false prophets,” and who by “the elect,” may be seen above (n. 624b, 684a). [3] In Moses: If there shall arise in the midst of thee a prophet or a dreamer of dreams who shall give thee a sign or a wonder, and if the sign or the wonder come to pass whereof he spake unto thee, saying, Let us go after other gods, thou shalt not obey (Deut. 13:1–3). Here a “prophet” and a “dreamer of dreams,” also “sign” and “wonder” are mentioned, because a “sign” has reference to a prophet, and a “wonder” to a dreamer of dreams, because a “prophet” means one who teaches truths, and in the abstract sense the doctrine of truth, and a “dreamer” means one who stirs up into action and in the abstract sense the stirring up from which a thing is done; this, too, pertains to a “wonder,” and the former to a “sign”; for prophets were instructed by a living voice from the Lord, and “dreamers” by representatives aroused to action, which flowed into the affection of the dreamer, and from that into the sight of the thought, for when a man dreams his natural understanding is laid asleep and his spiritual sight is opened, which draws its all from the affection. But in this passage the sight that draws its all from an evil affection is meant, for it treats of prophets who teach falsities and who dream vain things, for “other gods” mean the falsities and vain things that such heard and saw."

In Moses: If they will not believe thee nor hear the voice of the first sign, yet they will believe the voice of the latter sign. And if they will not believe these two signs nor hear thy voice, thou shalt take of the waters of the river and they shall become blood (Exod. 4:8, 9). This is said of the wonders wrought by Moses, when the Lord appeared to him in the bush, which are called “signs” because they were to attest and persuade that Moses was sent to lead them out of Egypt; this is why it is three times said “that they may believe,” and also “that they may hear his voice.” [5] In the same: Jehovah said unto Moses, How long will the people not believe in Me for all the signs which I have done in the midst of them? All the men that have seen My glory and the signs which I wrought in Egypt and in the wilderness, they shall not see the land (Num. 14:11, 22, 23). These miracles, too, are called “signs,” because mention is made of believing; for as has been said, miracles are called “signs” because they persuade and induce faith; and as signs did not induce faith with those who were unwilling on account of fear to enter into the land of Canaan, therefore it is said of them that “they should not see the land.” “Signs” have a like signification in Exod. 4:17; and 10:1, 2. [6] In the Gospels: The Scribes and Pharisees said, Master, we would see a sign from Thee. But He answering, said, An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign, but no sign shall be given to it but the sign of Jonah the prophet; for as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the whale, so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the belly6 of the earth (Matt. 12:38–40; Luke 11:16, 29, 30)."

[7] In Matthew: The Pharisees and the Sadducees, tempting, asked Jesus to show them a sign from heaven. He answering, said to them, When it is evening ye say, It will be fair weather, for the heaven is red. And in the morning, There will be storm today, for the heaven is red and gloomy. Ye hypocrites, ye know how to discern the face of heaven, but not the signs of the times. A wicked and adulterous nation requireth a sign, but no sign shall be given unto it but the sign of the prophet Jonah (Matt. 16:1–4). Here, too, the “sign” asked from heaven means attestation that they might be persuaded and might believe that the Lord was the Son of God, although miracles were wrought that they did not call signs. The Lord then spoke of evening and of morning because “evening and morning” signifies the Lord’s coming; here it means when the church with the Jews was laid waste, who then had “fair weather,” because they had no knowledge of the Lord, and lived securely in falsities from evil; this is the “evening”; but when they knew Him, and because of falsities from evils in which they were denied and assaulted Him, this is signified by “the morning when there is a storm.” This is why the Lord said, “Ye hypocrites, ye know how to discern the face of heaven, but not the signs of the times,” that is, the Lord’s coming; and because they were “a wicked and adulterous nation,” that is, one that adulterated the Word, He said that “no sign should be given unto them.” [8] So again in Mark:"

      "text": "APOCALYPSE EXPLAINED 2434 The Pharisees began to dispute with Jesus, seeking of Him a sign from heaven; and He, sighing in His spirit, said, Why doth this generation seek a sign? Verily I say unto you, There shall no sign be given unto this generation (Mark 8:11, 12). That a “sign” here signifies attestation by which they might plainly know, acknowledge, and believe, that the Lord was the Messiah and Son of God whom they expected from the predictions in the prophets, is evident from this, that “sighing in spirit, He said, Why doth this generation seek a sign? Verily I say unto you, There shall no sign be given unto this generation”; and this was because if this had been plainly revealed or told them from heaven, and if thus persuaded they had acknowledged and believed it, they would nevertheless have rejected it afterwards, and to reject after acknowledgment and faith is to profane, and the lot of profaners in hell is the worst of all. [9] That for this reason plain attestation was not given them from heaven is evident from these words in John: He hath blinded their eyes and hardened their hearts lest they should see with their eyes and understand with their heart, and should turn themselves, and I should heal them (John 12:40). “To turn themselves and be healed” means here to profane, which is done when truths and goods are acknowledged, especially when the Lord is acknowledged and afterwards denied; so would it have been if the Jews had turned themselves and been healed by a sign. “To see with the eyes and understand with the heart” signifies to receive in the understanding and will, or in faith and love. From this it is clear that a “sign” signifies a plain testification. (On the lot of profaners see the New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine, n. 172.) [10] In John: The disciples7 said unto Jesus, What doest Thou for a sign, that we may see and believe Thee, what workest Thou? Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, as it is written, He gave them bread out of heaven to eat. Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses"

Here also the disciples desired a sign; that this signifies attestation that they might believe is clear from their saying, “That we may see and believe, what workest Thou?” They then spoke of “manna,” and the Lord answered respecting “bread from heaven,” because “bread” signifies all good and truth that nourishes the soul, and in the highest sense the Lord Himself, from whom is everything of doctrine and everything of spiritual nourishment, whereby he gave attestation that they might see and believe. Nevertheless attestation, that is, a sign from heaven, was given to the three disciples, Peter, James, and John, as can be seen from the Lord’s transfiguration, for they then saw His glory, and heard a voice out of heaven saying, “This is My beloved Son, hear ye Him” (Mark 9:7; Luke 9:35; Matt. 17:5). [11] In John: When Jesus cast out of the temple them that sold therein, the Jews said, What sign showest Thou, that Thou doest these things? Jesus answered and said to them, Destroy this temple, yet in three days I will raise it up (John 2:16, 18, 19). Here evidently “to show a sign” signifies to give attestation by something wonderful, or by a voice out of heaven. But because such an attestation would have damned rather than saved them, as has been said just above, He answered them concerning “the temple,” by which He meant His body, that this should be destroyed, that is, should die, and should rise again glorified on the third day. This too is what the Lord meant by “the sign of Jonah in the belly of the whale three days and three nights.” (That “temple” in the highest sense signifies the Lord’s body, see John 2:21.) [12] In Luke: The angels said to the shepherds, There is born to you this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord; and this is a sign"

Since a “sign” means attestation that they might believe that the Savior of the world was born, it is said that “they should find Him lying in a manger wrapped in swaddling clothes”; but that this was an attestation no one can know until it is known what is meant by a “manger” and by “swaddling clothes.” “A manger” means the doctrine of truth from the Word, because “horses” signify the understanding of the Word (as can be seen from what has been shown above, n. 355, 364, and in the small work White Horse, n. 2–4); and thus a manger, as a feeding place for horses, signifies the doctrine of truth from the Word. It is said in the seventh verse of the same chapter that this was done “because there was no place in the inn,” an “inn” signifying a place of instruction. (This is the signification of “inn” also in Luke 10:34; 22:11; Mark 14:14; and elsewhere.) Because this was the state with the Jews, who were then in mere falsities, through the adultera tion of the Word, this was signified by “there was no place in the inn”; for if it had pleased the Lord He might have been born in a most splendid palace, and have been laid in a bed adorned with precious stones; but He would thus have been with such as were in no doctrine of truth, and there would have been no heavenly representation. He is also said to have been “wrapped in swaddling clothes,” because “swaddling clothes” signify first truths, which are truths of innocence, and which are also truths of the Divine love; for “nakedness,” in reference to a babe, signifies deprivation of truth. From this it is clear why it was said by the angels, “This is a sign unto you, ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in a manger.” [13] In the Gospels: The disciples said to Jesus, What shall be the sign of Thy coming and of the consummation of the age? (Matt. 24:3; Mark 13:4; Luke 21:7) “The coming of the Lord and the consummation of the age” signifies the beginning of the new church and the end of the former"

Moreover, the Lord calls them “signs.” As in Luke: And there shall be fearful things, great signs from heaven. There shall be signs in the sun, moon, and stars, and upon the earth distress of nations in desperation, the sea and the waves roaring (Luke 21:11, 25). In Matthew: And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man; and then shall all the tribes of the earth lament, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and glory (Matt. 24:30). The signification in the spiritual sense of these and the other things contained in the twenty-fourth chapter of Matthew have been explained in Arcana Coelestia, and of “the appearing of the sign of the Son of man in the clouds of heaven” in the work Heaven and Hell (n. 1); therefore further explanation is unnecessary. 706c. [14] In Mark: Jesus said unto the disciples, These signs shall follow them that believe, In My name shall they cast out demons; they shall speak with new tongues; they shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the infirm and they shall be well. And they went forth and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them by signs following (Mark 16:17, 18, 20). These were miracles, yet still they are called “signs” because they were attestations of the Divine power of the Lord who wrought them; therefore it is said, “The Lord working with them by those"

These miraculous signs, as that “they should cast out demons,” “should speak with new tongues,” “should take up serpents,” “if they drank any deadly thing it should not hurt them,” and “they should become well by the laying on of hands,” were in their essence and in their origin spiritual, from which these flowed forth and came forth as effects; for they were correspondences that derived their all from the spiritual world by influx from the Lord. For instance, that “they should cast out demons in the name of the Lord” derived its effect from this, that the name of the Lord understood spiritually means everything of doctrine out of the Word from the Lord, and that “demons” mean falsities of every kind, and these are thus cast out, that is, taken away, by the doctrine out of the Word from the Lord; that “they should speak with new tongues” derives its effect from this, that “new tongues” mean doctrinals for the new church; “they should take up serpents” was because “serpents” signify the hells in respect to malice, and thus they would be safe from infestation by it; “they would not be hurt if they drank any deadly thing” meant that they would not be contaminated by the malice of the hells; and “the infirm would become well by the laying on of hands” meant to be healed of spiritual diseases, which are called iniquities and sins, by communication and conjunction with heaven, thus with the Lord; the laying on of the hands of the disciples corresponding to communication and conjunction with the Lord, and thus to the removal of iniquities by His Divine power.

This was said to Ahaz king of Judah, because the king of Syria and the king of Israel made war against him, even to Jerusalem, and they also had on their side the tribe of Ephraim, and yet they did not prevail, for the reason that “the king of Syria” here represented the external or natural of the church, “the king of Israel” its internal or spiritual, and “Ephraim” its intellectual; but here these three, the natural, the spiritual, and the intellectual, perverted, and these wished to attack the doctrine of truth, signified by “the king of Judah” and by “Jerusalem,” wherefore they did not succeed. Nevertheless, in order that Ahaz might be assured of the frustration of their attempt he was told “to ask a sign,” that is, an attestation that he might be assured, and the choice was granted him whether it should be from heaven or from hell; this was signified by “direct it into the deep, or lift it up on high,” for the king was evil. But because “Jerusalem,” which signifies the doctrine of truth from the Word, was not to be destroyed by such before the Lord’s coming, there was given him, as an attestation of this, a miraculous sign, namely, that “a virgin shall conceive and shall bear a son, whose name shall be God-with-us.” That this church would subsequently be destroyed is indicated further on in the same chapter. [16] In the same: This shall be a sign to thee from with Jehovah, behold, I will bring back the shadow of the steps which is gone down on the steps of Ahaz before the sun, ten steps backward, that the sun may return ten steps on the steps which it has gone down (Isa. 38:7, 8). This sign was given to King Hezekiah as an attestation that the Lord would defend him and Jerusalem from the king of Assyria (as is said in the sixth verse of that chapter), that king signifying the perverted rational destroying all things of the church; therefore this sign represented also a new church that was to be established by the Lord, but here that the time would be protracted beyond that indicated to Ahaz just above; “bringing back the shadow that had gone down on the steps of Ahaz before the sun” signifies a drawing"

But this shall be further illustrated. The Lord’s coming took place when the Jewish church was at an end, that is, when there was no good or truth left in it; this is meant by “when iniquity was consummated,” also by “the fullness of times,” in which the Lord was to come. The entire period of the duration of the Jewish church was represented by “the steps of Ahaz,” its beginning by the first step there, which is when the sun is in its rising, and its end by the last when it is at its setting. This makes evident that by “the drawing back of the shadow” from the setting towards the rising means the prolongation of the time. This should take place “in the steps of Ahaz,” because Ahaz was a wicked king, and profaned the holy things of the church, consequently if his successors had done the same, the end of that church would have quickly come; but as Hezekiah was an upright king the time was prolonged, for on that account the iniquity of that nation was not so soon to reach its consummation, that is, its end.

This was done because “Assyria” signifies the rational, and “the king of Assyria” the like, and “Judea” the celestial of the church, and “its king” the spiritual of the church; but here “the king of Assyria” signifies the perverted rational, which destroys by false reasonings all the celestial and spiritual things of the church, which are its goods and truths. And as “Judea and its king” signify the celestial and spiritual of the church which will be from the Lord when He comes into the world, therefore these things are said by which is described the regeneration of those who will be of that church. So the sign that the first year “they shall eat that which springeth up of itself” signifies celestial good that the Lord will implant in them; “in the second year that which groweth of its own accord,” signifies the truth of that good which shall come from it; “to sow, to reap, to plant vineyards, and to eat the fruit thereof,” signifies all the goods and truths that flow forth therefrom, “to sow and reap” signifying the implantation of good and its reception; “to plant vineyards” the implantation of truth and its reception; and “to eat the fruits thereof” the enjoyment of good and joyous things therefrom which the regenerate man has. These things are called “a sign” because they are attestations of a celestial church with those who are meant in the spiritual sense by “Judah,” whose regeneration is effected by the Lord by the implantation of celestial good, afterwards by the implantation of spiritual good, which in its essence is the truth of celestial good, and finally by multiplication and fructification in the natural man.

This describes the Lord’s Divine power through attestations that cause belief; but attestations that are signs are not that “He setteth fast the mountains, maketh the tumult of the seas and of its waves, and the noise of the people to cease,” for these are not such signs as convince those who ascribe all things to nature; but the things meant in the spiritual sense, in which sense heaven and the church are treated of, are the signs that give attestation of the Lord’s Divine power, for in that sense, the “mountains” that God setteth fast by His power mean the higher heavens, because the angels of those heavens dwell upon mountains; and in the abstract sense love to the Lord and charity towards the neighbor are meant; these are what the Lord “girded with might, setteth fast by His power,” that is, makes them to stand fast forever; that “mountains” have such a signification may be seen above (n. 405); “the tumult of the seas” and “the tumult of the waves” mean the disputations and reasonings of those who are beneath the heavens, and who are natural and sensual; that “seas” signify the things of the natural man, thus those who are natural, therefore their tumults and waves signify disputations and reasonings, may be seen also above (n. 342). “The noise of the peoples” mean contradictions from falsities, for “peoples” signify those who are in truths, and in the contrary sense those who are in falsities (see above, n. 175, 331, 625). “That the dwellers in the uttermost parts may fear because of Thy signs” signifies holy worship from faith in regard to Divine power with those who are in the ultimates of heaven and the church; that “to fear” means to worship the Lord from charity and faith may be seen above (n. 696); and that “dwellers in the uttermost parts” mean those who are in the ultimates of heaven and the church, and are in the faith of charity there, is evident, since “the uttermost parts” mean the ultimates of heaven and the church.

That such would be destroyed by evils and falsities is meant by “He will give the king of Egypt into the hand of his adversaries and into the hand of them that seek his soul,” “adversaries” here meaning those who are in evils, and “them that seek the soul” those who are in falsities, thus in an abstract sense evils and falsities (that “Egypt” means the natural man see above, n. 654).

Again, the “signs” that were set upon mountains to gather the people together to war, to battle, and so on, signified indications to do the things commanded. As in Isaiah: It shall be in that day that the root of Jesse, which standeth for an ensign of the peoples, the nations shall seek, and his rest shall be glory. When he shall lift up an ensign to the nations, and shall gather together the outcasts of Israel and the dispersed of Judah from the four winds of the earth (Isa. 11:10–12). In Jeremiah: Set thee up signs, place for thee columns, set thine heart to the highway, the way thou mayest go (Jer. 31:21). Declare ye among the nations, and make to be heard, and lift up an ensign; Babylon is taken (Jer. 50:2). Lift up an ensign against the walls of Babylon, keep the watch, set the watchmen. Lift up an ensign in the land, sound the trumpet among the nations (Jer. 51:12, 27); and elsewhere, especially in the historical parts of the Word. From all these passages quoted from the Word it is clear that “a great sign seen in heaven” signifies Divine manifestation and attestation (as also in the third verse of this chapter, and afterwards in chap. 15:1). 707. A woman arrayed with the sun, signifies the church with those who are in love to the Lord, and thence in love towards the neighbor. This is evident from the signification of “woman,” as being the spiritual affection of truth, from which the church is a church, consequently also the church in respect to that affection (of which above, n. 555); it follows that this means the new church to be established by the Lord after the end of the present church, which is in the Christian world. This is evident also from the signification of the “sun,” as being the Lord in relation to the Divine love, thus also love to the Lord from the Lord (of which also above, n. 401, 412a, b); also from the signification of “arrayed”"

It is added, and thence in love towards the neighbor, because love towards the neighbor is derived from love to the Lord, as what is posterior is derived from its prior, or what is exterior from its interior; in a word, as an effect from its effecting cause; for love to the Lord is to love and to will those things that are of the Lord, consequently those things that the Lord has commanded in the Word, and love towards the neighbor is to act from that will, thus it consists in the performance of uses, which are effects. That this “woman” signifies the new church, which is to be established by the Lord after the end of the church now existing in the Christian world, can be seen from what follows in this chapter, namely, that “she brought forth a son, a male child which the dragon wished to devour, and that was caught up to God,” and that “the woman fled into the wilderness,” and there too “the dragon wished to destroy her”; for from what follows it will be seen that “the son a male” means the truth of the doctrine of that church, and “the dragon” means those who are opposed to the truths of that doctrine. That the church here meant by the “woman” is the same church as “the New Jerusalem” that is described chap. 21, and is there (verse 9) called “the bride, the Lamb’s wife,” will be seen in the explanation of that chapter. 708.

In the head of the Greatest Man, which is heaven, are those who are in love to the Lord from the Lord, and these are called celestial; but in the body, from the breast even to the loins of that Greatest Man, which is heaven, are those who are in love towards the neighbor, and these are called spiritual; but in the feet of the Greatest Man, which is heaven, are those who are obscurely in the faith of charity, and these are called natural.

Besides these distinctions in the heavens, however, there is the further distinction between those who receive light, that is, intelligence, from the Lord as a sun, and those who receive light and intelligence from the Lord as a moon. Those who receive the light of intelligence from the Lord as a sun are those with whom the intellectual and its rational have been opened, and who have, in consequence, thought rationally about what should be believed from the spiritual affection of truth; while those who receive light from the Lord as a moon are those in whom the intellectual and interior rational have not been opened, but only the natural, and who in consequence have thought from the memory about what should be believed; and to think about this from the memory is to think only from such things as have been heard from a teacher or"

If such while in the world were also in the faith of charity, they are in the heavens under the Lord as a moon, for the lumen, from which is their intelligence, is like the moon’s lumen in the nighttime, while the light from which is the intelligence of those who are in the heavens under the Lord as a sun is like the light of day. Of what nature the difference is can be seen from the difference between the light of the sun in the day and the light of the moon in the night. There is the further difference that those who are under the Lord as a moon can see nothing in the light that those have who are under the Lord as a sun, for the reason that their light is not genuine light but a reflected light, which can receive falsities as well as truths if only there seems to be good in the falsities. Because all those who are in the heavens under the Lord as a moon are natural and sensual, and have nothing in common with those who are in the heavens under the Lord as a sun, and moreover are in falsities, though in falsities in which there is good, therefore the moon was seen “under the feet” of the woman, which means the faith with those who are natural. [3] Thus much respecting the faith of those in heaven who are under the Lord as a moon. A few things shall also be said about their affection, from which faith derives its life. Their affection of knowing truth and doing good is, like themselves, natural, thus deriving more or less from the glory of being learned, and from reputation that looks to honors and gain as rewards, differing in this from such spiritual affection of knowing truth and doing good as those have who are in heaven under the Lord as a sun, for with these this affection is so separated from natural affection that the natural affection is under the feet. This, also, is why “the moon,” which signifies not only faith but also its affection, was here seen under the feet. (But a fuller idea of this can be gained from what is said and shown in the work Heaven and Hell; under the heads, heaven is divided into two kingdoms, n. 20–28; the sun and the moon in heaven, light and heat in the heavens, n. 116–140; and the correspondence of heaven with all things of man, n. 87–102; also in the New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine respecting those"

That “the sun” signifies the Lord in relation to Divine love, and thus love to the Lord from the Lord, and “the moon” the truth of faith, may be seen above (n. 401); moreover, respecting the heavens that are under the Lord as a sun, and those under the Lord as a moon, see also above (n. 411e, 422a, 527). To this is to be added, that there are three heavens that are under the Lord as a moon, a higher, a middle, and a lower; or what is the same, an interior, a middle, and an exterior, but yet all who are in these heavens are natural. These heavens are interior, middle, and exterior, because the natural like the spiritual is divided into three degrees; the exterior-natural communicates with the world, the interior with heaven, and the middle conjoins. Nevertheless, those who are in the heavens under the Lord as a moon cannot enter into the heavens that are under the Lord as a sun, because their interior sight or understanding has been formed to receive the lunar light there, and not to receive the solar light. They are comparatively not unlike those birds that see in the night and not in the daytime, consequently when they come into the sunlight that those have who are under the Lord as a sun their sight is darkened. Those who are in these heavens are those who have been in charity according to their religious principle, or according to their faith; but such as are natural and are not in the faith of charity are in the hells under these heavens. From this it is evident that the “moon” here means faith with those who are natural and are in charity; and the moon was seen “under the feet” because those who are in the heavens under the Lord as a moon have nothing in common with those who are in the heavens under the Lord as a sun, even to the extent that they are unable to rise up to them. 709.

From this it is clear that “the crown of twelve stars upon the head” of the woman signifies the wisdom and intelligence of those who are of that church through the doctrinals and knowledges of all things of truth and good from the Word. This is said of the woman after it is said that she was “arrayed with the sun, and the moon was under her feet,” because the “sun” signifies celestial and spiritual love, and the “moon” the faith of charity, and from these all wisdom and intelligence flow forth; for from the Lord as a sun heat and light proceed, and heat is the good of love, and light is truth from that good, and these two constitute wisdom and intelligence with angels and men, for the good of love enters their will, and truth from that good enters their understanding, and in the will and understanding together wisdom has its seat. 710a. Verse 2. And being with child, signifies nascent doctrine from the good of celestial love. This is evident from the signification of “being with child” [or having in the womb] as being, in reference to the church, which the woman signifies, the nascent doctrine of truth from the good of celestial love. For the “womb” signifies inmost conjugial love, and thence celestial love in the whole complex; and the embryo in the womb signifies the truth of doctrine from the good of celestial love, for it has a similar signification as “the son a male” which the woman brought forth, described in the fifth verse, which signifies the doctrine of truth from the good of love, but with the difference that the embryo, being yet in the womb, partakes more from the good of innocence than after it is born, therefore the embryo and the son a male both signify the doctrine of truth, the latter doctrine itself, but the former nascent doctrine. From this it is clear that “being with"

[2] The “womb” signifies the inmost good of love, because all the members devoted to generation, both with males and with females, signify conjugial love, and “the womb” its inmost, because there the fetus is conceived and grows, until it is born; moreover, it is the inmost of the genital organs, and from it is also derived the maternal love that is called “storge.” Because the man who is regenerating is also conceived, and as it were carried in the womb and born, and because regeneration is effected by truths from the good of love, so “to bear in the womb” signifies in the spiritual sense the doctrine of truth from the good of love. There is also a correspondence of the womb with the inmost good of love, since the whole heaven corresponds to all things with man (of which correspondence see in the work Heaven and Hell, n. 87–102); and thus also the members devoted to generation; these correspond there to celestial love. There is also an influx of that love out of heaven with mothers during the time of gestation, and into the embryos; and from it springs the love of the babe with mothers, and innocence with babes. This shows why the “womb” signifies the inmost good of love, and “to bear in the womb” signifies the nascent doctrine of truth from the good of love. [3] That this is the signification of the “womb,” and of “bearing in the womb,” can be seen from the following passages in the Word. In Isaiah: Hearken unto Me, O house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the house of Israel carried from the womb, borne from the matrix; even unto old age I am the same, and even to hoariness I will carry; I have made, I will carry, and I will bear and will deliver (Isa. 46:3, 4). This is said of the reformation of the church, and of the regeneration of the men of the church by the Lord. The church is signified by “the house of Jacob” and “the house of Israel,” the external church by “the house of Jacob,” and the internal by “the house of Israel.” “Those carried from the womb” signify those who are being regenerated by the Lord, and “those borne from the"

Because the man who is being regenerated is first conceived by the Lord, and next is born, and lastly is educated and perfected, and because regeneration is in this respect like the natural generation of man, so “to be carried from the womb” signifies the state of the man who is to be regenerated from conception to birth; the birth itself and afterwards education and perfection, is signified by “to be borne from the matrix; even unto old age I am the same, and even to hoariness I will carry”; “I have made, I will carry, and I will bear and will deliver,” have like significations; the former meaning regeneration by the goods of love and charity, and the latter regeneration by the truths from those goods; “to deliver” means to take away and remove evils and falsities that are from hell. [4] In Hosea: Ephraim, as a bird shall his glory fly away, from the birth and from the belly and from conception; yea, if they have brought up their sons, yet I will make them bereaved of man. Give to them, O Jehovah, a miscarrying matrix and dry breasts. Ephraim is smitten, their root is dried up, they shall yield no fruit, even when they have borne I will kill the desires of their belly (Hos. 9:11, 12, 14, 16). “Ephraim” means the church in respect to the understanding of truth and good; that there will be no longer any understanding of Divine truth in the church is signified by “Ephraim, as a bird shall his glory fly away,” “glory” signifying Divine truth, and “to fly away” signifying to be scattered; the expression “to fly away” is used because it is said of a bird, and a bird is mentioned because it signifies things belonging to the understanding and to thought therefrom; “from the birth and from the belly and from conception” signifies the dispersion of all truth from things last to things first, “birth” signifying things last, because it signifies what has been born; “from the belly and from conception” signifies what is before birth, thus all things from things last to things first, for when last things perish things prior also successively fall away; “if they have brought up their sons, yet I will make them bereaved of man,” signifies that although they have acquired for themselves truths, yet they will be without intelligence, “sons” signifying the"

This, too, describes the regeneration of the spiritual man by such things as belong to natural generation from the mother; therefore “Thou art He that took me out of the womb” signifies that one is regenerated by the Lord and made a man of the church; “Thou dost give me trust from my mother’s breasts” signifies that one is afterwards led and spiritually educated, “the mother’s breasts” signifying spiritual nourishment in such things as belong to the church, “mother” meaning the church; “I was cast upon thee from the womb” signifies that the Lord has done all things from the good of love, and “Thou art my God from my mother’s belly”"

These chapters treat of the consummation of the age, which means the end of the church when there is the last judgment; therefore “those that bear in the womb” and “those that give suck in those days,” over whom there is lamentation, mean those who then receive the goods of love and the truths of such good; “those that bear in the womb” mean those who receive the good of love, and “those that give suck” mean those who receive the truths of that good, for the “milk” which is given signifies truth from the good of love. It is said, “Woe to them,” because those who receive goods and truths are unable to keep them, for in such a state hell prevails and snatches away the goods and truths, and thence comes profanation. Hell then prevails because at the end of the church the falsities of evil rule, and take away the truths of good; for man is held in the midst between heaven and hell, and before the last judgment that which arises out of hell prevails over that which comes down out of heaven.

For all truths are from good; and goods are of two kinds, celestial good, which is the good of love to the Lord, and spiritual good, which is the good of charity towards the neighbor; “breasts” have a similar signification as “milk,” namely, truth from good. [9] In the same: A woman lifting up her voice out of the throng said of Jesus, Blessed is the belly that bare Thee, and the breasts that Thou hath sucked; but Jesus said, Yea, rather blessed are they that hear the Word of God and keep it (Luke 11:27, 28). Because “to bear in the belly” and “to give suck with the breasts” signify the regeneration of man, as has been said above, the Lord answered, “Blessed are they that hear the Word of God and keep it,” which describes the regeneration that is effected by truths from the Word and a life according to them; “to hear the Word of God” signifies to learn truths from the Word, and “to keep it” signifies to live according to those truths.

Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, except one be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of the heavens. That which is born of the flesh is flesh, but that which is born of the spirit is spirit (John 3:4–6). Nicodemus evidently understood natural generation instead of the spiritual generation, of which the Lord spoke, therefore the Lord teaches him concerning regeneration, which is effected by truths from the Word, and by a life according to them, and this is signified by “being born of water and of the spirit,” for “water”"

[11] Because it is the Lord alone who reforms and regenerates man, He is called in the Word “the Former from the womb,” as in Isaiah: Jehovah, thy Maker and thy Former from the womb, helpeth thee (Isa. 44:2, 24). Jehovah hath called me from the womb, from the bowels of my mother doth He make mention of my name. Thus said Jehovah, my Former from the womb, to be His servant, to bring back Jacob to Him, and that Israel be gathered to Him (Isa. 49:1, 5). In many passages in the Word the Lord is called “Creator,” “Maker,” and “Former from the womb,” and also “Redeemer”; for the reason that He creates man anew, reforms, regenerates, and has redeemed him. It may be believed that the Lord is so called because He created man and forms him in the womb, but yet it is the spiritual creation and formation that is here meant; for the Word is both natural and spiritual; it is natural for men, who are natural, and spiritual for angels, who are spiritual, as can also be seen from this, that what is here said is said of Israel, and in the highest sense of the Lord. “Israel” means the church, thus every man of the church; and because the Lord knows what the nature of every man is in respect to the good of love and the truth of faith it is said, “Jehovah hath called me from the womb, from the bowels of my mother doth He make mention of my name”;13 “to call and to know the name” of anyone signifies to know of what nature he is; “from the womb” means to know this in respect to the good of love; and “from the bowels of my mother” in respect to the truths from that good; “Jacob” who shall be brought again to Him, and “Israel” who shall be gathered to Him, signify the church, “Jacob”"

[18] In Hosea: The iniquity of Ephraim is tied together, his sin is hidden away, the throes of a woman in travail shall come upon him; he is a son not wise, for he doth not stay his time in the womb of sons (Hos. 13:12, 13). “Ephraim” signifies the understanding of truth, here the understanding perverted, which is the understanding of falsity instead of truth; its falsity is signified by “iniquity,” and the evil of falsity by “his sin”; therefore he is called “a son not wise”; his not accepting reformation is signified by “the throes of a woman in travail shall come upon him,” and by “he doth not stay his time in the womb of sons,” this signifying that he does not remain in a state of reformation. [19] In Isaiah: I knew that in dealing treacherously thou wouldst deal treacherously, and the name of a transgressor was given thee from the womb (Isa. 48:8). This is said of “the house of Jacob,” which means the perverted church; “to deal treacherously” signifies to act contrary to revealed truths; and “to have the name of a transgressor given from the womb” signifies a turning away from truths from the first time when one might be reformed; “to be called by name” signifies of what quality one is in respect to truths.

What this signifies in the internal sense no one can know unless it is known that Jacob and his posterity even from their fathers down were merely natural, and therefore were opposed to the good of heaven and the church; for whoever is natural and not at the same time spiritual is opposed to that good, since that good is acquired solely through the conjunction of truth and good, first in the spiritual man and afterwards in the natural; but “Esau” signifies natural good in the spiritual. Now because Jacob and his posterity were such, and because they rejected every such good, and this from the very first time, it is said of Jacob that “he supplanted his brother in the womb.” Moreover, the combat of Jacob with the angel, which is described in Genesis 32:24–31, depicts the tenacity with which they insisted upon possessing the land of Canaan, which means that a church should be instituted with them; this tenacity is depicted by that combat, and also by what is said in the next verse, in Hosea: And he struggled vigorously with the angel, he wept and entreated him (Hos. 12:4). But that they would nevertheless be destitute of any good of celestial and spiritual love is meant by: The angel touched the hollow of Jacob’s thigh, and the hollow of his thigh was put out of joint in wrestling with the angel (Gen. 32:24, 31). For the thigh signifies the conjunction of good and truth, and “its being put out of joint” signifies that with Jacob and his posterity there was no conjunction of truth with good; this is meant by “Jacob struggled vigorously with God.” (But on this see Arcana Coelestia, n. 4281, where it is explained. That the Israelitish and Jewish nation was not chosen, but was accepted to represent a church, because of the tenacity with which their fathers and Moses persisted, see n. 4290, 4293, 7051, 7439, 10430, 10535, 10632.)"

And the days for bringing forth were fulfilled, and behold twins were in her womb; and the first came forth red all over like a hairy garment, and they called his name Esau. And afterwards his brother came forth, and his hand had seized Esau’s heel, and he called his name Jacob (Gen. 25:20–26). These historical statements involve what has just been said about Jacob and his posterity, namely, that they were merely natural, and thus were in no natural good from spiritual, which is signified by “Esau.” That Jacob’s posterity was without that good is signified by Jacob’s seizing Esau’s heel when he came forth out of his mother’s womb, the “heel” signifying the lowest natural.

The “Mede” means those who make no account of the truth and good of the church, and who destroy the things of the understanding and love that are therefrom; the “silver” that they will not esteem, and the “gold” they will not delight in signify the truth and good of heaven and of the church, “silver” the truth and “gold” the good of these; “their bows will dash in pieces the young men, and they will have no compassion on the fruit of the belly,” signifies that the falsities of doctrine will destroy all the understanding of truth and all the good of love; “the bow” meaning the falsity of doctrine, “the young men” the understanding of truth, and “the fruit of the belly” the good of love; “their eye shall not spare the sons” signifies that their perverted understanding and insanity will lay waste every truth of the church, “sons” meaning truths, and the “eye” the perverted understanding, which is insanity.

Jesus, answering, said, Have ye not read that He who made them from the beginning made them male and female, and said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother and shall cleave to his wife, and they twain shall become one flesh? Therefore they are no more twain but one flesh. What, therefore, God hath joined together let not man put asunder. Moses for the hardness of your heart suffered you to put away your wives, but from the beginning it was not so. I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife except for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery; and whosoever marrieth her that is put away committeth adultery. The disciples said, If the case of the man is so with his wife, it is not expedient to contract matrimony. But Jesus said, All do not receive this word, but they to whom it is given; for there are eunuchs who were so born from their mother’s womb, and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of God. He that is able to receive let him receive (Matt. 19:3–12). That this contains interior arcana can be seen from the Lord’s saying that “all do not receive these words, but they to whom it is given.” The interior arcanum contained in these words spoken by the Lord is but little apprehended by men, but it is apprehended by all angels in heaven, because they perceive these words of the Lord spiritually, and the arcana contained in them are spiritual. These arcana are, that there are marriages in the heavens even as on earth, but in the heavens the marriages are of like with like; for man is born to act from the understanding, but woman from affection, and the understanding with men is the understanding of truth and good, and the affection with women is the affection of truth and good; and as all understanding derives its life from affection, therefore the two there are joined together, as the affection which belongs to the will is joined with the correspondent thought which belongs to the understanding. For the understanding is different with everyone, as the truths that constitute the understanding are different. In general there are celestial truths, spiritual truths, moral truths, civil truths, and even natural truths; and of every kind of truth there are species and varieties innumerable; and since in consequence of this the understanding of one is never like the understanding of another, nor the affection of one like that of another, yet, in order that the understanding and affection may act as one, they are so joined together in heaven that the correspondent"

Now because two different affections cannot correspond to one understanding, therefore in heaven one man never has and never can have several wives. [26] From this it can be seen and concluded what these words of the Lord also mean spiritually, as what is meant by “a man shall leave father and mother and shall cleave to his wife, and they shall be one flesh,” namely, that man must leave that evil and falsity that he has from his religion, and that defiles his understanding, that is, that he has from father and mother, and his understanding separated from such evil and falsity must be conjoined with the correspondent affection which belongs to the wife, thus the two become one affection of truth and good; this is meant by “one flesh” which the two must become, “flesh” signifying in the spiritual sense good which is of love or affection. “Therefore they are no more twain but one flesh” signifies that thus the understanding of good and truth and the affection of good and truth are not two but one, in like manner as while will and understanding are two they are nevertheless one; and the like is true of truth and good and of faith and charity, which indeed are two but yet one, that is, when truth is of good and good is of truth, so also when faith is of charity and charity is of faith; and this also is the source of conjugial love. [27] “Moses for the hardness of their heart suffered them to put away a wife for every cause,” because the Israelites and Jews were natural and not spiritual, and those who are purely natural are also hard in heart, since they are not in any conjugial love but in lascivious love, such as is the love of adultery. It is said that “whosoever shall put away a wife except for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery,” because fornication signifies falsity, and with a woman the affection of evil and falsity, thus an affection that does not at all agree with the understanding of truth and good; and since by such discordance conjugial love, which is of truth and good, and thence is heaven and the church with man, is"

[28] The Lord afterwards spoke of eunuchs because the disciples said, “If the case of the man is so with the wife, it is not expedient to contract matrimony”; also because with the Jewish nation, which was a nation hard in heart because they were in falsities from evil, marriages were not marriages, but understood in the spiritual sense were adulteries, and therefore that nation was called by the Lord “an adulterous generation.” This was why the Lord spoke of eunuchs, “eunuchs” meaning those who have no desire to enter into marriage, that is, to be conjoined with the affection of evil, because the understanding of truth and good would thus be perverted and dissipated; thus “eunuchs” mean both the married and the unmarried in whom the understanding of truth and good is conjoined with the affection of truth and good. Such are called “eunuchs” because they have no lasciviousness, such as those have who, from the hardness of heart in which the Jews were, take several wives, and divorce them for every cause. [29] It is to be known, in the first place, that the marriage of the understanding of truth and good with the affection of truth and good has in general a threefold origin, and thus is in a threefold degree. In the highest degree is the marriage of those who are called celestial, in a lower degree the marriage between those who are spiritual, and in the lowest degree between those who are natural; for there are three degrees of man’s interiors, and thence there are three heavens; those in the highest heaven are called celestial, those in the lower, spiritual, and those in the lowest natural. The marriage of the understanding of truth and good with the affection of truth and good with the celestial is meant by “the eunuchs who"

[30] The marriage of the understanding of truth and good with the affection of truth and good of those who are spiritual is meant by “the eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men,” for such do not become regenerate in the womb, that is, through love, but through truths first received in the memory, and afterwards intellectually in the thought, and so finally in the life through a certain spiritual affection; these are said “to be made eunuchs by men” because they are reformed through the understanding from the memory, and “man” signifies that understanding, as also above, where “man and wife” are mentioned. But the marriage of truth and good with the affection of truth and good with those who are natural is meant by “eunuchs who make themselves eunuchs,” for those who are natural acquire for themselves by means of cognitions and knowledges a natural lumen, and through the good of life according to these knowledges they acquire affection and thence conscience; and as these know no otherwise than that they themselves do this, for the natural man does not enjoy the intelligence of the spiritual man, nor does he enjoy the perception of the celestial man, so these are meant by those who “make themselves eunuchs”; but this is said from the appearance, and from the obscure faith with them. This, therefore, is the meaning of “becoming eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of God.” And as there are but few who apprehend these things the Lord says, “He that is able to receive let him receive.” (But in illustration of this subject see what is said in the work Heaven and Hell, under the heads, the two kingdoms into which the heavens are divided, and the three heavens according to the three degrees of man’s interiors, n. 20–40, and marriages in heaven, n. 366–386.)

The leaping in the womb at the salutation of Mary represented the joy arising from the love of the conjunction of good and truth, thus the joy of celestial conjugial love, which is in every particular of the Word. (That John the Baptist, like Elijah, represented the Lord in relation to the Word, see in Arcana Coelestia, n. 7643, 9372.) 710d. [32] What is signified by “the male that first opened the womb” shall also be told. Of this it is said in Moses: When Jehovah shall have brought thee into the land of Canaan, thou shalt cause to pass over to Jehovah everyone that shall open the womb, and every firstling that cometh of beast, as many males as thou hast shall be Jehovah’s. But every firstborn among thy sons thou shalt redeem. And it shall be that if thy son shall ask thee on the morrow, saying, What is this? thou shalt say unto him, By strength of hand Jehovah brought us out of Egypt, out of the house of servants, when he slew all the firstborn in the land, from the firstborn of men even to the firstborn of beast; therefore I sacrifice to Jehovah everyone that openeth the womb, the males; but all the firstborn of my sons I redeem (Exod. 13:11–15; 34:19, 20). That the Levites were accepted in place of these, see in the same: Behold, I have taken the Levites from among the sons of Israel instead of all the firstborn that openeth the womb among the sons of Israel, that the Levites may be Mine, for every firstborn is Mine, in the day when I smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt I hallowed unto Me all the firstborn in Israel, from man even to beast they shall be Mine (Num. 3:12, 13; 8:16, 17).

Because this is so, and because marriage signifies in the spiritual sense the marriage of truth and good, as has been said above, it can be seen thence what is signified in the same sense by “the one that openeth the womb, the firstborn male.” “The one that openeth the womb, the firstborn male” signifies that which is firstborn from celestial love and from the perception of good and truth; and this evidently is truth from good, which serves as a beginning to what follows; in its essence this is spiritual good, since that good in its form is truth from good, or, what is the same, truth from good in its essence is spiritual good. This is signified by “the one that openeth the womb, the firstborn male,” because “the womb” corresponds to inmost conjugial love, which in its essence is celestial love, and from that love spiritual good comes forth, which in its form is truth from good, and in particular, that truth from good which is in place of a beginning to what follows; that which is in the place of a beginning is everything as regards their essential in the things that succeed, because that is what rules in them. As this is what is signified by “the one that openeth the womb, the firstborn male,” therefore this was made holy to Jehovah, and by it also all the subsequent offspring were sanctified. [33] It is to be known that the goods of heaven and the church are of three degrees; the good of the inmost degree, thus also of the inmost heaven, is called the good of celestial love; the good of the lower degree, which is also the good of the middle heaven, is called the good of spiritual love; and the good of the lowest degree, which is the good of the lowest heaven, is called natural good. These goods, as they follow in order, are also born in order. The good of natural love is born from the good of spiritual love, and the good of spiritual love is born from the good of celestial love; and for this reason “the one that openeth the womb, the firstborn male,” signifies the good of spiritual love born from the good of celestial love."

That this is so is also evident from this, that the Levites were taken in place of all the firstborn; for “Levi” (and thence the Levite) signifies spiritual good from celestial good; consequently the priesthood, which signifies celestial good, was given to Aaron and his sons, and the ministry of that good which signifies truth from good, was given to the Levites. (That this was the signification of the tribe of Levi see above, n. 444.) The statute respecting the firstborn was given to the sons of Israel because all the firstborn in Egypt were slain, for the reason that “the firstborn in Egypt” signify the falsities from evil contrary or opposite to truths from good, thus infernal evil contrary or opposite to spiritual good; and for the reason that when those falsities from evil in man are slain, that is, removed, truths from good (that is, spiritual good) then first flow in from the Lord and are received by man. From this it is evident what was represented and in the spiritual sense signified by that statute. What was signified by: God’s closing up every womb of the house of Abimelech on account of Sarah, Abraham’s wife, and after Abraham prayed for them God’s healing Abimelech, his wife, and their maidservants, that they might bring forth (Gen. 20:17, 18), may be seen in Arcana Coelestia, where it is explained. 711.

This shows that “a great red dragon” means all who are merely natural and sensual from the love of self, and yet have more or less knowledge from the Word or from doctrine therefrom or from preaching, and who think to be saved by knowledge alone without the life of charity. Such think to be saved by knowledge alone without the life of charity, because all who live for the body and the world, and not for God and heaven, become merely natural and sensual; for everyone is inwardly formed according to his life, and to live for the body and the world is to live a natural and sensual life, while to live for God and heaven is to live a spiritual life.

This is so because knowledge and the faculty of reasoning are merely natural, and can therefore also be with evil men, even with the worst of men; but truths from the Word with a life according to them are what make man spiritual, for life is willing truths and doing them from a love of them; this is not possible to the natural man alone, but must come from the spiritual, and from its influx into the natural; for to love truths and from love to will them and from that will to do them is from heaven, that is, through heaven from the Lord, and is in its nature celestial and Divine; this cannot flow in immediately into the natural mind, but only mediately through the spiritual mind, which is capable of being opened and formed for the reception of heavenly light and heat, that is, for the reception of Divine truth and Divine good. These cannot flow immediately into the natural mind, for the reason that man’s hereditary evils, which belong to the love of self and the world, have their seat in that mind; therefore the natural man, viewed in itself, loves nothing but self and the world, and from love wills, and from will does those evils, and these block the way to the influx of anything out of heaven into the natural man, and its reception there; therefore it has been provided by the Lord that these evils can be removed, and for a place to be given for the truths and goods of spiritual love, namely, by the opening and formation of the spiritual mind which is above the natural mind, and by the influx of heaven from the Lord through that mind into the natural mind. [3] This has been said that it may be known that to know the things that are of the Word and of the doctrine of the church does not make man spiritual, but a life according to those things that the Lord has commanded in the Word; therefore although such know many things from the Word they yet remain natural and sensual."

[4] Since in the rest of this chapter and also afterwards “the dragon” is treated of, it shall be told what sort of persons, in general and in particular, it signifies. In general it signifies those who are more or less natural, and yet are in a knowledge of spiritual things from the Word. But in particular it signifies those who have confirmed themselves by doctrine and life in a faith separated from charity. These constitute the head of the dragon. But those who from self-intelligence hatch out for themselves dogmas from the Word constitute its body, while those who study the Word without doctrine constitute its external parts. All these also falsify and adulterate the Word, since they are in the love of self, and thence in the pride of self-intelligence, from which they become merely natural, yea, even sensual, and the sensual man is unable to see the genuine truths of the Word because of fallacies, obscurity of perception, and the evils of the body residing therein; for the sensual clings to the body, from which such things come. [5] (1) In the first place, “the dragon” means in general those who are more or less natural, and yet are in a knowledge of spiritual things from the Word, because “serpents” signify in general the sensual things in man, and thence sensual men; therefore “the dragon,” which is a flying serpent, signifies the sensual man who yet flies towards heaven in that he talks and thinks from the Word or from doctrine from the Word.

Because they see nothing from the light of heaven they do not see truths, but in place of them falsities, which they call truths; for truths themselves can be seen only in the light of heaven, and not in the light of the world unless that light is illuminated by the light of heaven. These being such love no other than a bodily and worldly life; and as the pleasures and lusts of that life have their seat in the natural man the interiors of such are filthy and crowded with evils of every kind, which close up every way for the influx of the light and heat of heaven; consequently they are inwardly devils and satans, however much they may appear to be spiritual and to be Christians by their talk and simulated gestures.

But what their doctrine is and what their life is shall be told. Their doctrine is, that God the Father sent His Son, born from eternity, into the world, that He might become man, might fulfill all things of the law, might bear the iniquities of all and suffer the cross; and that thereby God the Father was reconciled and moved to compassion; and that those who from confidence were in a faith respecting these things would be received into heaven; and that the confidence of that faith, together with the Lord, would intercede and save; consequently that such a faith is given to mankind, who are separated from God the Father, as a medium of reception and salvation, because when Adam had eaten of the tree of knowledge man was no longer in a state to do good of himself, for he had thus lost, with the image of God, his free will; lastly, that these things are the Lord’s merit, by which alone man can be saved. These in respect to doctrine are the primary things of faith with those who are in faith alone. Elsewhere, the Lord willing, it shall be explained and illustrated that no one can, from any spiritual sight, which is of the understanding, perceive and thus believe anything of this; but such things can be known and talked about only from the memory, without any understanding, thus that in that doctrine there is nothing of intelligence. [8] Of what quality such as these are in respect to life shall also be stated. They teach that man is led of God by faith alone, even to the endeavor to do good, and that good itself in act contributes nothing to salvation, but faith alone does this, and that then nothing of evil condemns him, because he is in grace and is justified. Moreover, they have thought out the steps, which they call the progressions of faith alone, even to the last step of justification; the first is information as to the things that pertain to faith, especially those above mentioned; the second is confirmation from the Word or from preaching; the third is mental investigation whether it be so or not; and as doubt and consequent wavering, which is temptation, then flow in, there must be confirmation from"

They add that heed must be taken that the understanding be not allowed to go further than to secure confirmations from the Word respecting justification by faith alone; if it goes beyond this and is not kept in obedience to faith the man is overcome. The fourth and last step is an endeavor to do good; and this is an influx from God and not at all from man, and is the fruit of faith; for they say that after a man has thus been fully justified nothing of evil condemns him and nothing of good saves him, but faith alone. From this it is clear what such are in respect to life, namely, that they live for themselves and not for God, and for the world and not for heaven; for this follows from the belief that evils do not condemn and that goods do not save. Nor do they know that faith without the life of charity is not faith, and that man ought to shun evils and do good as of himself, and yet to believe that it is from the Lord, and that otherwise evils cannot be shaken off, nor goods appropriated. But more will be said also about this elsewhere. [9] Such is the doctrine and the life with those who form the head of the dragon, who for the most part are the erudite leaders, but few are from the common people; and for the reason that the leaders regard these things as secrets of theology that cannot be comprehended by the common people because of their secular employments. These belong to the head of the dragon for the reason also that they pervert and falsify all things of the Word which teach love, charity and life; for the Word, viewed in itself, is simply the doctrine of love to the Lord and charity toward the neighbor, and nowhere the doctrine of faith separate from charity. Such falsify the Word by calling them either faith or such fruit as is not eaten, because they give no thought to doing, and thus they are not nourished by that fruit. Moreover, they admit these principles no further than into the memory, and therefrom into the thought nearest to it, which is sensual thought, in which there is nothing spiritual, and this thought does not inquire whether a thing is true; therefore they"

This is why those who constitute the head of the dragon have no genuine truth, for from a false principle, such as faith alone, nothing can flow forth except falsities in a continual series; nor indeed can there be any such thing as faith alone, for faith apart from charity is not faith, since charity is the soul of faith, therefore to speak of faith alone is to speak of what is without a soul, thus without life, which in itself is dead. [10] (3) That those constitute the body of the dragon who have hatched out for themselves from self-intelligence dogmas from the Word can be seen from this, that all of such who study the Word and are in the love of self are also in the pride of self-intelligence, and all who are in this pride and at the same time excel in cleverness from natural lumen, hatch out dogmas therefrom for themselves; this is the origin of all the heresies and all the falsities in the Christian world.

It is said that their intelligence is not from their own but from the Lord, because when such read the Word they are elevated above what is their own and even into the light of heaven, and are enlightened; in that light truth appears from truth itself, because the light of heaven is Divine truth. But they who are in the love of self and in the pride of self-intelligence therefrom cannot be elevated out of their own, for they look to self continually, thus in every least thing they do. Thence it is that they place everything of salvation in faith in their own dogmas, thus in knowing and thinking, and not at the same time in life, that is, not in willing and doing. These, therefore, constitute the body of the dragon. The heart of this body is the love of self, and the breath of its respiration, or of its spirit, is the pride of self-intelligence; from these two the dragon is called “great red,” and the term “red” in the original Greek text is from fiery red, thus from love and pride. [11] (4) Those who study the Word without doctrine and are at the same time in the love of self, constitute the externals of the draconic body. Externals are what proceed from the interiors, and involve, inclose, and contain them, like the skins, the scales, and the prominences on every part. Such constitute the externals of the dragon’s body because they are without the intelligence of the spiritual things of the Word; for they only know the Word in respect to the sense of its letter, which is such that, unless doctrine lights the way, it may lead into errors and falsities of every kind; consequently those who study the Word without doctrine are able to confirm as many heresies as they will, and also to embrace them, and also to protect them by the loves of self and of the world and the evils arising therefrom. For the sense of the letter of the Word is the ultimate sense of Divine truth, thus it is for the natural and sensual man, adapted to its apprehension, and often so as to favor it; consequently unless it is read and viewed from doctrine, as from a lamp, it carries the mind away into darkness respecting many things that pertain to heaven and the church. And yet such believe themselves to be wise above all others, when in fact they are not wise at all."

This will be illustrated in what follows, where the combat of the dragon with Michael is treated of. [13] (6) From this it can now be seen that the “tail” of the dragon means the falsification and adulteration of the Word by those who constitute its head, its body, and its extremities; for its tail, like the tail of every animal, is a continuation of the spine, which is an extension from the brain, and thus it is moved, bent, and vibrated, according to the appetites, lusts, and pleasures of the head and body, which it caresses, as it were. And inasmuch as all those that constitute the dragon falsify and adulterate the Word, because they are natural and sensual from the love of self and thence are in the pride of self-intelligence, therefore it is said that “the dragon with his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven and cast them unto the earth”; “the stars of heaven” signify the knowledges of truth and good from the Word, thence the truths from good therefrom, and “to cast them unto the earth” signifies to pervert and adulterate and thus destroy them.

That the same word in Hebrew means dragons and such serpents can be seen in Moses: When he was commanded out of the bush to cast his rod to the earth, and when it was changed to a serpent, he took hold of its tail, and thereby it was changed again into a rod (Exod. 4:3, 4). Moses took the rod and cast it down before Pharaoh, and it became a serpent [dragon], and the magicians did the like with their rods; but the rod of Moses, then a serpent [dragon], swallowed up the rods, the serpents [dragons], of the magicians (Exod. 7:9–12). The word rendered serpent in the former passage and the one so rendered in the latter in the original language are different; in the former passage the word generally employed in other parts of the Word for serpent is used, but in the latter it is the same word as is translated “dragon”; thus it might also be rendered that when Moses’ rod was cast before Pharaoh it was changed into a dragon. From this it follows that “dragon,” the same as “serpent,” signifies in a good sense the sensual which is the ultimate of the natural man when it is not evil or not wicked.

Moreover, there are men merely sensual who are good. 715. Having seven heads, signifies the knowledge of the holy things of the Word, which they have adulterated, and consequent insanity, and yet craftiness. This is evident from the signification of “head,” as being intelligence and wisdom, and in the contrary sense insanity and folly (of which above, n. 553, 577), and that it also means craftiness (n. 577); also from the signification of “seven,” which is all persons and all things, and is predicated of things holy (see above, n. 257), so here of the holy things of the Word, which they have adulterated. As “seven” is predicated of things holy, so also in the contrary sense it is predicated of holy things adulterated and profaned, for in the Word every word has also a contrary sense, and what is contrary to what is holy is profane. From this it is clear that heads and seven are not meant by the “seven heads” that the dragon was seen to have, but the knowledge of the holy things of the Word which they have adulterated, and consequent insanity but yet craftiness. [2] “The head of the dragon” signifies insanity, because the intelligence of the man of the church is from genuine truths which are from the Word. The truly human understanding is formed and perfected by natural, civil, moral, and spiritual truths, the interior understanding by spiritual truths, but the exterior by moral and civil truths; therefore such as the truths are such is the understanding that is formed of them. All spiritual truths are from the Word, and make one with the good of love and charity. When, therefore, a man places everything of the church and of heaven in faith, and separates from that faith the good of charity and love, as those do who constitute “the head of the dragon,” as has been said in the preceding article, then the interior understanding cannot be formed, consequently in place of intelligence in things spiritual"

Thence it is evident that “the head of the dragon” signifies insanity in spiritual things. [3] “The head of the dragon” also signifies craftiness, because all those who constitute his head are merely natural and sensual, and if these have at the same time studied the Word and the doctrine of the church, and have caught at falsities in place of truths, and have confirmed these by knowledges, they are crafty above the others; but this craftiness does not manifest itself in the world as it does afterwards when they become spirits, for in the world they cover over the craftiness with external piety and feigned morality which conceal it; but as the craftiness abides in their spirit it is plainly manifest when externals are removed, as is done in the spiritual world. But it is to be known that the craftiness signified by “the head of the dragon” is a craftiness in perverting the truths and goods of the Word by means of reasonings from fallacies and sophistries, also from things persuasive, by which the understanding is fascinated, thus by inducing upon falsities the appearance that they are true. That this is so can be seen from “the serpent” by which the first parents were led astray, that is said to have been: More crafty than any wild beast of the field (Gen. 3:1); that “serpent” having a similar signification as “the dragon,” therefore the dragon is also called “the old serpent that seduceth the whole world,” in the ninth verse of this chapter. 716. And ten horns, signifies much power. This is evident from the signification of “horn,” as being the power of truth against falsity and evil, and in the contrary sense the power of falsity against truth and good (of which above, n. 316, 567); also from the signification of “ten,” as being all persons and all things, likewise many persons and many things (of which also above, n. 675); which shows that “ten horns” signify much power.

[2] “The dragon” had such power because “the dragon” means such as have separated faith from the goods of charity, which are works, and have confirmed this by the sense of the letter of the Word, which they thus twist from its genuine sense, and as it were draw it down from heaven; and because at the end of the church, which Revelation treats of, there is no charity, therefore the dragon then has power; for at the end of the church everyone wishes to live for himself, for the world, and according to his own bent, and few wish to live for the Lord, for heaven and eternal life; and the principle of faith alone, which is faith separated from charity, favors the former life, and like the current of a river draws in and carries away all to thus believing and living. This is why “the dragon,” which signifies such persons and such things, was seen to have “ten horns.” [3] It has been said heretofore that falsities from evil have no power whatever; but it is to be known that falsities from evils have no power against truth from good; for truth from good is from the Lord, and the Lord has all power by His Divine truth. But falsities from evil have a power that is signified by “the ten horns of the dragon,” because they prevail against those who are in falsities from evil, since such persons and such falsities act as one; moreover, man is in evil and in falsities therefrom hereditarily from his parents, and afterwards from actual life, especially at the end of the church; and these falsities from evil cannot be expelled from man in a moment, but little by little; for if they were expelled in a moment man would expire, because they constitute his life. Because such is man’s state at the end of the church, the falsities of evil prevail, although they have no power whatever against truth from good."

Such as are here meant by “the dragon” are meant also by “the he-goat” that fought with the ram (Daniel 8), and by “the goats” in Matthew 25; for “he-goats” there signify those who are in faith separated from charity, and “the ram” and “the sheep” those who are in charity. 717a.

But the evil adulterate them, and thence see nothing of the light of heaven in them, but yet believe them to be holy because they apply them to confirm the falsities of their religion, so from the faith they have in their holiness the truths still shine before them; and since this is so, and since they acquire for themselves by means of these truths communication with the heavens they are finally deprived of them, and left to their falsities in which there is no light; this is done when they are let down into hell. [4] That the truths of the sense of the letter of the Word appear as diadems is evident from the diadems in the spiritual world. In the palaces of angels in heaven there are many things that shine with precious stones. Sometimes precious stones are also let down into the lower parts, and are presented as a gift to those who have done some good thing; they are even sold there as in the world, especially by the Jews, who also there trade in them. It is granted and permitted to the Jews to trade in precious stones in the spiritual as in the natural world, because they regard the sense of the letter of the Word as holy. For the same reason also noble women below the heavens adorn themselves with diadems as in the world. When it is asked where those diadems in heaven and thence in the lower parts are from, it is said that they are from the Lord, and from the spiritual light that is from Him, and that they are ultimates of that light, which are called effects; also that they are representative forms of the affections of truth from good, thus that they are Divine truths in the ultimate of order, such as the truths of the sense of the letter of"

As this is the origin of precious stones, there are some in the world of spirits who are allowed to make diadems by inserting together truths from the sense of the letter of the Word, but these diadems are not genuine, and are not hard like crystals, because they are artificial. [5] From this it can now be seen what “diadems or precious stones” signify in the following passages. In Isaiah: O thou afflicted and tossed with tempests and not comforted, behold, I lay thy stones with stibium, and thy foundations in sapphires, and I will make thy suns a carbuncle, and thy gates into stones of ruby, and all thy border into stones of desire, and all thy sons shall be taught of Jehovah (Isa. 54:11–13). This is said of “the barren who did not bear,” who should have many sons, by whom the Gentiles that had no Divine truths because they did not have the Word are signified; therefore they are called “afflicted and tossed with tempests and not comforted,” “to be afflicted and tossed with tempests” is predicated of falsities by which they are infested and carried hither and thither. That when the Lord comes He will reveal to them Divine truths and instruct them, is signified by “I will lay thy stones with stibium, and thy foundations in sapphires, and I will make thy suns into a carbuncle, and thy gates into stones of rubies, and thy borders into stones of desire.” It is evident that the “precious stones” here mentioned mean Divine truths in the ultimate of order, like the truths of the sense of the letter of the Word, in which are internal truths, which are such truths as are in the spiritual sense of the Word; for the “foundations, gates, and borders,” which were to be laid with these precious stones, signify ultimates; consequently here “stones” in general, and “sapphires,” “carbuncles,” and “stones of ruby,” signify such truths as are in the sense of the letter of the Word, which are ultimate truths because they are for the natural and sensual man. Because the instruction of the Gentiles in Divine truths is meant by these words it is added, “and all thy sons shall be taught of"

[6] Because “the city of the New Jerusalem” signifies the doctrine of the new church, and “the foundations of its wall” signify ultimate Divine truths, and “gates” introductory Divine truths, therefore the foundations are described by twelve precious stones, and the gates by pearls, in Revelation: The foundations of the wall of the city the New Jerusalem were adorned with every precious stone; the first foundation was jasper, the second sapphire, the third chalcedony, the fourth emerald, the fifth sardonyx, the sixth sardius, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh hyacinth, the twelfth amethyst. The twelve gates were twelve pearls, each gate was [one] pearl. And the street of the city was pure gold, as it were transparent glass (Rev. 21:19–21). These “twelve precious stones” constituting the foundations, and “the twelve pearls” constituting the gates signify ultimate Divine truths, which are the truths of the sense of the letter of the Word, upon which the doctrine of that church is founded, and by which man is introduced as by gates. The foundations are said to be “of precious stones,” and the gates “of pearls,” because the sense of the letter of the Word contains in it the spiritual sense, thus the light of heaven, which makes the sense of the letter of the Word to be pellucid, as those stones are from light and from fire. But of this more hereafter, when the particulars are explained. [7] The precious stones of which the breastplate of judgment called Urim and Thummim was made, which was upon the ephod of Aaron, and also those that were set upon the shoulders of the ephod have a similar signification, in Moses: They shall make the ephod of gold, hyacinthine, purple, scarlet double dyed, and fine twined linen, the work of the designer.

The first row a ruby, a topaz, a carbuncle; the second row a chrysoprase, a sapphire, and a diamond; the third row a cyanus, an agate, and an amethyst; and the fourth row a tharshish, an onyx, and a jasper. The stones shall be upon the names of the sons of Israel, twelve upon their names, the engravings of a seal for every one upon his name, they shall be for the twelve tribes. This was the breastplate of judgment, the Urim and Thummim (Exod. 28:6–30). What these things involve no one can know unless he knows what Aaron represented, and thus what his garments signified, and the ephod in particular (for it was because his garments were significative that they were called “the garments of holiness”); also what the “breastplate” upon the ephod, which was called “the breastplate of judgment, the Urim and Thummim,” signified; also what “the twelve tribes of Israel,” and “the twelve stones upon their names” signified. As to Aaron himself, he represented the Lord in relation to the priesthood, which is the Lord’s celestial kingdom; while “his garments” in general represented the spiritual kingdom, for this in the heavens invests the celestial kingdom. For there are two kingdoms into which the heavens are divided, the celestial kingdom and the spiritual kingdom. That is called the celestial kingdom where the Divine good proceeding from the Lord is received, and that is called the spiritual kingdom where Divine truth is received; therefore Divine truth is signified by “the garments of Aaron” in general, and Divine truth in ultimates by the “ephod,” since this was the outmost vestment. That “garments” in general signify truths, and “the Lord’s garments,” which appeared bright white as the light when He was transfigured before the three disciples, signified the Divine truth proceeding from Him, and likewise “the Lord’s garment divided by the soldiers,” may be seen above (n. 64, 65, 195, 271, 395, 475a, 476, 637).

Thou wast the cherub, the spreading out of him that covereth, and I have set thee, thou hast been in the mountain of the holiness of God, thou hast walked in the midst of the stones of fire (Ezek. 28:12–14).

Because man has wisdom and intelligence from this, it is said “King of Tyre, thou art full of wisdom and perfect in beauty”; “beauty” signifying intelligence, because all beauty in the heavens is according to intelligence. The sense of the letter of the Word is also meant by “the cherub, the spreading out of him that covereth,” for “cherubim” signify a guard that the Lord be not approached except through the good of love, and the sense of the letter of the Word is what guards, because it covers its interiors. “The mountain of holiness” signifies the church in respect to the doctrine of love and charity; and “the stones of fire,” in the midst of which he walked, signify truths from the good of love, according to which is the life. That “precious stones” here signify truths pellucid from the light of heaven, which is Divine truth, can be clearly seen from this, that “Tyre” signifies in the Word the knowledges of truth and good, which knowledges are ultimate truths, such as belong to the sense of the letter of the Word.

Because “Syria and Sheba and Raamah” likewise signify the knowledges of truth and good, and “tradings” the acquisition of these, those regions are said to have given “precious stones in their tradings.” The knowledges of truth and good are truths in ultimates such as the truths of the sense of the letter and the literal sense of the Word. [11] In Job: The stones thereof are the place of sapphire, and it hath dust of gold. Where shall wisdom be found, and where is the place of understanding? Gold is not given for it, neither is silver weighed for the price of it; it cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, the precious onyx and the sapphire; gold and the diamond cannot vie with it; coral and crystal shall not be mentioned with it, and the choice of wisdom is above pearls; the topaz of Ethiopia shall not vie with it. Behold, the fear of the Lord is wisdom, and to depart from evil is intelligence (Job 28:6, 12, 13, 15–19, 28). Because all wisdom and understanding comes through ultimate Divine truths spiritually understood, and because these truths are signified by the precious stones here named, as “the onyx, the sapphire, the diamond, the topaz, and pearls,” and because these stones being of earthly materials, although they are accounted precious in the world, are as nothing in respect to intelligence and wisdom, it is said that they are not to be valued as equal with intelligence and wisdom, nor are gold and silver. Comparisons are made with these because they are significative; otherwise they are comparatively of no account. [12] In David: Thou, Jehovah, shalt arise and have compassion upon Zion, for Thy servants desire the stones thereof (Ps. 102:13, 14). “The stones of Zion” which the servants of Jehovah desire mean Divine truths, for “Zion” upon which Jehovah will have mercy, means the church that is in celestial love."

This chapter treats of the war of the king of the north with the king of the south; and “the king of the north” means those who are in knowledge from the Word, but not in life, thus who are in so- called faith alone, but yet not in charity, since they reject charity as not contributing to salvation. But “the king of the south” means those who are in intelligence from the Word, because they are in charity; such are “the king of the south,” or pertain to “the king of the south,” because “the south” means light, and “light” signifies intelligence, and those who are in charity, which is the life of faith, have the light of intelligence from the Word. But “the king of the north,” or those who belong to “the king of the north” are such as are described above, because the “north” means night, and also a cold light, such as is the light of winter, from which, because there is no heat in it, there is no fructification; for spiritual heat is charity, and all germination is from heat through light."

From this it can be seen that “the king of the north” also means those who are in faith alone, that is, in faith without charity. [18] The same are meant in Daniel by “the he-goat” that fought with the ram; the same also are meant by “the dragon” in this chapter, with the difference, that “the dragon” means properly the learned who have confirmed themselves by doctrine and life in faith separated from charity, for these have poison like dragons that destroys charity. For this reason the angel Michael is also mentioned in Daniel 12:1. That those who place everything of the church in the knowledge of cognitions from the Word, and nothing in life, pervert and falsify the truths of the Word is meant by “the king of the north shall honor a strange god whom their fathers knew not,” and “shall honor him with gold, silver, precious stone, and pearls”;18 “his god” meaning the truths of the Word falsified, since “God” when mentioned in the Word means the Lord in relation to Divine truth, thus the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord, and when “Jehovah” is mentioned, the Lord in relation to Divine good, thus the Divine good proceeding from the Lord is meant; therefore “a strange god whom his fathers knew not” means the truths of the Word falsified, which in themselves are falsities, and are not acknowledged by those who were previously of the church. Those truths and goods of the Word themselves, though falsified, are signified by “precious stones and desirable things,” as also by “silver and gold,” for the truths of the Word do not change their essence wheñthey are with the evil. “Fortresses upon the station,” and “strongholds of fortresses” signify the things of self-intelligence confirmed by the sense of the letter of the Word, which is such that"

From this the signification of “the seven diadems upon the heads of the dragon” can now be seen. 718. Verse 4. And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, signifies the falsification and adulteration of all truths of the Word. This is evident from the signification of “drawing with the tail,” as being, in reference to “the dragon,” falsification and adulteration (of which presently); also from the signification of “the third part,” which means all, and is predicated of truths (see above, n. 384, 506); and from the signification of the “stars of heaven,” as being the knowledges of truth and good from the Word (see also above, n. 72, 402), thus also truths, for the knowledges of truth and good are the truths of the natural man, from which the rational and spiritual man has intelligence. From this it is evident that “to draw with the tail the third part of the stars of heaven” signifies in reference to the dragon to falsify and adulterate the truths of the Word. Such is the signification because “the dragon” means in general all who acknowledge the Word and read it and yet do not live according to it, and this because they separate life, which is charity, from faith, and believe that it is sufficient merely to think those things that are in the Word, and to persuade themselves that they are saved by thinking and talking about certain things from the Word with trust and confidence, and that faith alone justifies and saves, and not anything of life or work. (That such are meant by “the dragon” may be seen above, n. 714.) To confirm their dogmas from the Word they bring forward passages in which faith is mentioned and in which faith is treated of; but the passages in which charity and love are mentioned, and doing is spoken of, they pervert by applying them to faith alone, and thus they falsify the Word, which from beginning to end is the doctrine of love to the Lord and of charity towards the neighbor. This falsification and adulteration of the truths of the Word is meant by “drawing down with the tail the third part [of the stars] of heaven.”"

(That the “tail” signifies the sensual, which is the ultimate of the natural man, may be seen above, n. 559.) Whether it is said that the loves of the sensual man falsify and adulterate the truths of the Word or that the sensual does this, it is the same, for the sensual loves to live for the body and for the world, thus according to its own nature; and this life it feels, but it does not feel the interior life, therefore it denies that life. 719. It is said that the sensual falsifies and adulterates the truths of the Word; but it needs to be known how it can falsify and adulterate the truths of the Word, for those who do not know how this is done and what is the nature of the Word, might think that because the truths of the Word are truths, and are plainly extant in the sense of its letter, they cannot become falsities. But to illustrate this take an example from nature, such as the natural man can clearly perceive. It appears before the eyes as if the sun were each day carried about the earth, also at the same time once each year; therefore it is said in the Word that the sun rises and sets, which causes the day, noon, evening, and night, also the seasons of spring, summer, autumn, and winter, and thus days and years; and yet the sun stands unmoved, while the earth revolves daily and is carried about the sun yearly, and the progression of the sun is only an appearance and thence a fallacy. Now when this truth is known and accepted that it is not the sun but the earth that moves, both become true, namely, that the sun stands unmoved in the center of its system, and also that it has its progressions; that it stands unmoved is true for the rational man, and that it has its progressions is true for the sensual, thus both become true, true actually for the rational man, and true apparently for the sensual.

It is the same with every particular of the Word in the sense of its letter; because this is the ultimate sense it is natural, and is adapted to the comprehension of the sensual man, thus of children and the simple; for this reason most things in it are appearances of truth, and unless these are perceived at the same time from a spiritual, that is, from an enlightened understanding, they become falsities; for they are then believed to be actually true and not merely apparently true. But it is otherwise when they are perceived understandingly and spiritually; then all things of the Word become true, in the genuine sense actually true, and in the sense of the letter apparently true, as was said above respecting the sun. From this it can be seen how innumerable things in the Word are falsified and adulterated; as that God tempts, that He is angry, that He does evil, that He casts into hell; likewise, that at the day of the last judgment the Lord is to come in the clouds of heaven, that the sun and the moon will then withdraw their light, and the stars will fall from heaven; also that the world with the earth will perish, and a new creation of all things take place; with other things that are truths of the sense of the letter of the Word, but which become falsities if they are not perceived at the same time from an enlightened understanding. But in what follows it shall be told how faith alone, which is faith separated from charity, falsifies all things of the Word. 720.

This is evident from the signification of “casting to the earth,” when said of the “stars” by which is signified the knowledges of truth and good from the Word, thus truths; here it means to extinguish and destroy, for truths are extinguished and destroyed when they are falsified and adulterated.

By falsities from other sources, those especially are meant that are from ignorance, from fallacies, and from religion with those who do not have the Word. It is to be known that those who live in evil, and yet say that they are saved because they have faith, have scarcely any genuine truth, however many things they know and draw forth from the sense of the letter of the Word; for the sense of the letter of the Word is such that when it is not comprehended interiorly it may be explained in various ways, and when that sense is not looked at from genuine truths it is believed according to the letter and is falsified, according to what was shown in the preceding article in the comparison with the movement and position of the sun. That such have scarcely any genuine truth was ascertained with some in the spiritual world who had confirmed faith alone by doctrine and life, who it was found did not know and acknowledge a single genuine truth; angels investigated it and were surprised. This showed clearly that they had extinguished and destroyed with themselves the truths of the Word. This, then, is meant by “the dragon drew down the third part of the stars of heaven with his tail, and cast them to the earth”; as the he-goat did also in Daniel: The horn of the he-goat waxed great even to the host of the heavens, and some of the host and of the stars it cast down to the earth and trampled upon them; and it cast down the truth to the earth (Dan. 8:10, 12). “The host of the heavens” means all the truths and goods of heaven and the church. (The stars that shall fall from heaven have a like signification, Matt. 24:29.) 721a. And the dragon stood before the woman who was about to bring forth, signifies the hatred of those who are meant by “the dragon” against the church with those who will be in the doctrine, and thence in the light of love and charity from the Lord.

The hatred of those who are signified by “the dragon” against that church and its doctrine, is meant by “standing before the woman about to bring forth and wishing to devour the offspring.” Also from the signification of “bringing forth,” as being to bring forth such things as pertain to the church, which are doctrinals, here respecting love to the Lord and charity towards the neighbor, for “the son, a male” that the woman brought forth signifies the doctrine of that church. Such things are signified by “bringing forth,” because generations, births, and nativities mean in the Word spiritual generations, births, and nativities, which are effected by truths and a life according to them. [2] For this reason where spiritual generation, which is called regeneration, is treated of in the Word it is described by natural generation and birth. As in John: Jesus said to Nicodemus, Except one be begotten anew he cannot see the kingdom of God. Nicodemus said, How can a man be begotten when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother’s womb and be begotten? Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, except one be begotten of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh, but that which is begotten of the spirit is spirit. (John 3:3–6). As Nicodemus did not understand the spiritual sense of the Lord’s words “that a man must be begotten anew,” the Lord explained that “to be begotten” means “to be begotten of water and of the spirit,” thus to be regenerated, that is, by means of truths from the Word and a life according to them, for “water” signifies truths, and “spirit” a life according to them. But elsewhere in the Word, where “to travail,” “to bring forth,” “to produce,” and “to beget” are mentioned, there is no explanation, and yet spiritual travail, birth, nativity, and generation are meant, since the Word in the letter is natural, but in its bosom"

[3] To confirm that births and nativities signify in the Word spiritual births and nativities, some passages shall be cited from it. In Isaiah: Be ashamed, O Zidon, the sea hath said, the stronghold of the sea, saying, I have not travailed, neither brought forth, I have not trained up young men, I have not brought up virgins; when the report comes from Egypt they shall be seized with pain as at the report respecting Tyre (Isa. 23:4, 5). “Zidon” and “Tyre” signify the knowledges of good and truth from the Word; that the church has not acquired through these anything of intelligence and wisdom, and has not done any uses, is signified by “not travailing,” “not bringing forth,” “not training up young men,” “not bringing up virgins,” “young men” meaning the truths of the church, and “virgins” its goods. (But this may be seen explained above, n. 275a. ) [4] In the same: Thy chastening is upon them, as a woman with child that draweth near to her delivery; she crieth out in her pangs; so have we done19 before Thee, O Jehovah; we have conceived, we have travailed, we have as it were brought forth wind; we have not wrought salvation to the earth, neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen; thy dead shall live (Isa. 26:16–19). This is said of the last times of the church, when falsities and evils so far increase that there can be no reformation and regeneration; this state is meant by “the chastening of Jehovah upon them”; that it will then be difficult to perceive and acquire any truth is signified by “as a woman with child that draweth near to her delivery; she crieth out in her pangs”; that in the place of truths they imbibe"

[5] In the same: Sing aloud O barren, thou that didst not bear, break forth into singing and cry aloud, thou that didst not travail, for more are the sons of the desolate than the sons of the married one (Isa. 54:1). This treats of the Lord’s coming and of the new church to be established by Him with the Gentiles; these are signified by “the barren that did not bear,” and by “the desolate” who shall have many sons; they are called “barren” because they did not know the Lord, and did not have the Word where truths are, and therefore could not be regenerated, “sons” meaning truths from the Lord through the Word. The church that has the Word, from which the Lord is known, is meant by “the married one” that has no sons; the joy of those who are of the new church that before had no truths, is signified by “break forth into singing and cry aloud, thou that didst not travail,” “to travail” meaning to bear in the womb. [6] In the first book of Samuel: They who have been driven away have been girded with strength; they that are sated, have hired themselves for bread, and they that are hungry have ceased, even until the barren hath borne seven, and she that hath many sons languisheth (1 Sam. 2:4, 5). This is the prophetic song of Hannah, the mother of Samuel. “Those driven away that are to be girded with strength” mean the Gentiles with whom the church is to be, who are called “driven away” from a lack of the knowledges of truth, and who are therefore rejected by those of the church, at that time the Jewish"

[7] In Jeremiah: She that hath borne seven shall languish, she shall breathe out her soul; her sun shall go down while it is yet day (Jer. 15:9). This signifies that a church that has all truths because it has the Word shall perish, even so that nothing of truth and good will remain; “to bear seven” signifies to be gifted with all truths from the Word; “to languish, and to have the sun go down,” signifies to perish successively and at length wholly; “to breathe out the soul” signifies to perish in respect to all truths, and “the sun going down” signifies to perish in respect to all the goods of love; “while it is as yet day” signifies while the Word is still acknowledged. [8] In Isaiah: Before she travailed she brought forth; before her pangs came she was delivered of a male child. Who hath heard a thing like this? Who hath seen a thing like this?

This, too, treats of the Lord’s coming and of the establishment of a church with the Gentiles. Their reformation and regeneration are described by “travailing,” “bringing forth,” “being delivered of a male child,” and by “breaking the matrix” and “begetting”; for, as has been said above, a man who is begotten anew is likewise as it were conceived, carried in the womb, born, educated, and grows up, as from a father and mother. “Zion” and “Jerusalem” mean the church and its doctrine; and “to suck and be satisfied with the breast of her consolations” signifies to be fully instructed in truths from good from the delight of love according to desire; the “one day” in which these things shall take place signifies the Lord’s coming. [9] In David: From before the Lord thou art in travail, O earth, from before the God of Israel21 (Ps. 114:7). “Thou art in travail, O earth,” signifies the establishment of the church, or the reformation of those who will be of the church, “to travail” meaning to receive truths and be reformed, and “the earth” meaning the church. It is said “from before the Lord” and “from before the God of Jacob,” because reformation in respect to good and truth is meant, for the Lord is called “Lord” from good, and “God” from truth. 721b.

That from such the church will be established is signified by “Behold, I bring them, I will gather them together and a great assembly shall they return hither.” [11] In Isaiah: Look unto the rock out of which ye were hewn, and to the digging out of the pit out of which ye were digged; look unto Abraham, your father, and unto Sarah that bare you; for I called him alone, and I will bless him and will multiply him; for Jehovah will comfort Zion, He will comfort all her waste places, and He will make her wilderness like Eden, and her solitude like the garden of Jehovah (Isa. 51:1–3).

The Lord in relation to Divine truth and in relation to the doctrine of truth is meant by “the rock out of which they were hewn and the pit out of which they were digged” (see above, n. 411). But the Lord in relation to the Divine, from which is reformation, is meant by “Abraham” to whom they shall look, and by “Sarah” that bare them; for by “Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,” in the Word, those persons are not meant, but the Lord in relation to the Divine Itself and the Divine Human, as may be seen in Arcana Coelestia (n. 1893, 2833, 2836, 3245, 3251, 3305, 3439, 3703, 4615, 6098, 6185, 6276, 6804, 6847); but the heavenly marriage which is that of Divine good and Divine truth, from which is all reformation and thus the church, is signified by “Abraham” and by “Sarah that bare them.” Because the Lord is meant by “Abraham” it is said, “I"

Is there no king in thee; hath thy counselor perished, that pangs take hold of thee as a woman in travail? Be in travail and bring forth, O daughter of Zion, for now thou shalt go out from the city and shalt dwell in the field (Mic. 4:8–10). This treats of the spiritual captivity in which the faithful are when they remain in a church in which there is no more truth and good; their lamentation that they are in that church is signified by “why dost thou shout in shouting?” Also by “that pangs take hold of thee as a woman in travail”; when yet they have truths of doctrine and also the understanding of them, which is signified by “Is there no king in thee; hath thy counselor perished?” “king” signifying the truth of doctrine from the Word, and “counselor” the understanding of it. That with those who are in the good of charity and thence in the truths of doctrine there will be a church is signified by “the daughter of Zion to whom the kingdom shall come,” and by “the daughter of Jerusalem,” “kingdom” also signifying the church. The establishment of the church and reformation of those who are of the church is meant by “be in travail, bring forth, O daughter of Zion”; “for now thou shalt go out from the city and shalt dwell in the field” signifies that they will withdraw from a doctrine in which there is no longer any truth or good, and will abide where these abound; “city” meaning the doctrine from which they will withdraw; “field” meaning where truths and goods abound, and “to go out” meaning to withdraw,"

A “partridge” means such as learn many things from the Word and from the doctrines of the church, but not for the sake of the uses of life, “to bring forth” means to perform uses, that is, to live and thus to be reformed; the “riches” that he maketh not with judgment signify spiritual riches, which are the knowledges of truth and good; to acquire these not for the sake of uses of life is “to make riches not with judgment”; that such knowledges as are not made to be of the life perish is signified by “in the midst of his days he shall forsake them”; that finally they will have no knowledges of truth that are not falsified is signified by “in his latter end he shall become foolish.” [16] Since a “mother” signifies the church, and “sons and daughters” its truths and goods, and in the ancient churches, and afterwards in the Jewish church, all things were representative and thence significative, it was a reproach and disgrace for women to be barren, therefore: Rachel was angry with Jacob that she bare no children, and when she brought forth Joseph she said, God hath gathered up my reproach (Gen. 30:1, 23).

That this was a grief of heart and mind, and a reproach to the church, is signified by “a day of distress, of reproving and of reproach.” [18] In Ezekiel: I will pour out my wrath upon Sin, the strength of Egypt, and will cut off the multitude of No; I will set a fire in Egypt; Sin shall travail, and there shall not be22 for the breaking through (Ezek. 30:15, 16). “Egypt,” “Sin,” and “No,” signify the knowledges and fallacies of the natural man, which hinder the reformation of man by means of truths from the Word; that truths will be known and yet will not be received in the life, and thus there can be no reformation, is signified by “Sin in travailing shall travail, but there shall not be for the breaking through,” that is, of the matrix."

Since “to travail” signifies to receive the truths of the Word by hearing or reading, and “to bring forth” signifies to make them fruitful and bring them forth in act, which is to live according to them, and thus be reformed, so when these things are done with distress and difficulty because of the falsities and evils that rule in the church, and that hinder and which pervert its truths and goods, then it is said that “they are seized with pangs as of a woman in travail”; and as this takes place at the end of the church, therefore it is said in the Word of those who live at that time, as in this chapter of Revelation: That a woman being with child, cried out, travailing, and pained to be delivered (verse 2); which signifies that spiritual truths and goods, which are from the Word, can be received only with the greatest difficulty and with distress, because of the opposing evils and falsities that then exist in the church and occupy the minds of those who are devoted to religion. [19] This is signified by “the pangs as of a woman in travail” in Jeremiah: I have heard a voice as of one sick, as of one in travail with her first born, the voice of the daughter of Zion; she sigheth, she spreadeth forth her hands. Woe to me now, for my soul is made desolate by the slayers (Jer. 4:31). “The daughter of Zion” means the church that is in the truths of doctrine from the good of love; this is said “to sigh and to spread forth the hands, because her soul is made desolate by the slayers,” “slayers” meaning those who destroy man’s spiritual life by falsities and evils; and because on this account spiritual truths and goods can be received only with distress and difficulty, there is said to be lamentation “as of one sick and in travail with her firstborn,” “firstborn” signifying the first thing of the church, from which the rest flow as from their beginning."

That truths will then be received in faith and in love with the greatest difficulty, because of the opposing falsities of evil, and that there will be in consequence torment and pain of mind and heart, is signified by “the hands are slackened, distress has taken hold of them, and pangs as of one in travail”; that at such a time the things of the church and of its doctrine will not be considered, in taking thought for oneself, is signified by “Go not forth into the field, go not in the way,” “field” meaning the church, and “way” doctrine; and this for the reason that falsity from hell rushes in, by which truth is falsified and extinguished, which is signified by “the sword of the adversary, terror on every side,” “sword” meaning falsity destroying truth, “adversary” hell, and “terror” spiritual death.

This also is said of the last state of the church, when the last judgment takes place; “the great day” is the Lord’s coming and judgment by Him at that time; “ask and see whether a male doth bring forth” signifies whether the truth of the Word without the good of life can bring forth anything of the church, since everything of the church is brought forth by the marriage of good and truth, “the male” signifying the truth of the church, and “the wife” the good of the church; “wherefore do I see every man with his hands on his loins as a woman in travail?” signifies why is it thought that truth without good will bring forth such things as belong to the church? “Loins” signify marriage, in the spiritual sense the marriage of truth and good, but “the loins of a man as of a woman in travail” signify, as if there could be a marriage of truth alone with out good; “all faces are turned into paleness” signifies that there is nothing of good because there is nothing of love and charity; the “face” means the affections that are of the love of good, therefore “paleness” signifies those affections extinguished.

In Isaiah: Howl ye, for the day of Jehovah is nigh. Therefore all hands are slackened, and every heart of man doth melt, and they are dismayed; throes and pangs seize upon them, they are in travail like a woman bringing forth, a man is amazed at his companion, their faces are faces of flames (Isa. 13:6–8). “The day of Jehovah” that is near signifies the last judgment which the Lord accomplished when He was in the world; their terror at that time on account of threatening destruction is signified by “all hands are slackened, and every heart of man doth melt, and they are about to perish”;23 that their ability to receive the truths and goods of heaven and the church is then in vain because of the falsities of evil in which they have been and then are in, is signified by “throes and pangs seize upon them, they are in travail like a woman bringing forth”; that they are in the evils of hatred and anger is signified by “their faces are faces of flames.” [25] In Jeremiah: She that dwelleth in Lebanon, having her nest in the cedars, what grace wilt thou find when pangs come upon thee, pain as of a woman in travail?

The king of Babyl on heard the fame of the people coming from the north; thence his hands are relaxed, distress hath taken hold of him, pain as of a woman in travail (Jer. 50:43). In Moses: The peoples heard, the pain of a travailing woman hath seized upon the inhabitants of Philistia (Exod. 15:14). “The pains of a woman in travail” have a similar signification as in the passages above. In Hosea: The pangs of a woman in travail shall come upon Ephraim, he is a son not wise, for he doth not stay his time in the womb of sons (Hos. 13:13). This may be seen explained above (n. 710b). In Moses: Jehovah God said to the woman, In multiplying I will multiply thy pain and thy conception; in pain shalt thou bring forth sons; and thy obedience shall be to thy man, and he shall rule over thee (Gen. 3:16).

Because the natural man is full of lusts from the love of self and of the world, and these can be removed only by means of truths, therefore it is said “thy obedience shall be to thy man, and he shall rule over thee,” “man” signifying here as elsewhere in the Word the truth of the church.

Also from the signification of “to devour,” as being to destroy; for what is predicated follows its subject, and when “the dragon” is the subject, “to devour” is predicated of him, but when the doctrine of the church is the subject, being destroyed is predicated of it, therefore “to devour” here signifies to destroy. To destroy it at its first rise is signified because it is said “that when the woman brought forth he might devour her offspring.” “To devour” and “to eat” also elsewhere signify to destroy, when predicated of wild beasts, which signify falsities and evils, as is evident in Ezekiel: One of the whelps of the lion went up, it became a young lion, and it learned to seize the prey, it devoured man (Ezek. 19:3, 6). “To devour man” signifies to destroy the understanding of truth and intelligence.

In Daniel: Behold, a beast, like to a bear, it had three ribs in the mouth between the teeth, it was said to it, Rise, devour much flesh (Dan. 7:5). Moreover, in the Hebrew, “to devour” in many passages stands for to consume, to ruin, and to destroy, as in Jeremiah: They have devoured Jacob, they have devoured him and consumed him, and have laid waste his habitations (Jer. 10:25; and elsewhere). 723. Verse 5. And she brought forth a son, a male, who is to tend all the nations with an iron rod; and her offspring was caught up unto God and His throne. 5. “And she brought forth a son, a male,” signifies the doctrine of truth for the church that is called the New Jerusalem (n. 724, 725); “who is to tend all the nations with an iron rod,” signifies that this doctrine, by the power of natural truth from spiritual, will refute and convince those who are in falsities and evils and yet are in the church, where the Word is (n. 726, 727); “and her offspring was caught up unto God and His throne,” signi fies the protection of the doctrine by the Lord, because it is for the new church (n. 728). 724a. Verse 5. And she brought forth a son, a male, signifies the doctrine of truth for the new church that is called the New Jerusalem. This is evident from the signification of “son,” as meaning truth, and of “a son, a male,” as meaning the genuine truth of the church, consequently also its doctrine, for the truth of the church from the Word is its doctrine, since doctrine contains the truths that are for the church. But the genuine doctrine of the church is the doctrine of good, thus the doctrine of life, which is of love to the Lord and of charity towards the neighbor; but yet it is the doctrine of truth, since doctrine teaches life, love, and charity, and so far as it teaches it is truth; for when a man knows and"

From this it can be seen that every doctrine of the church is a doctrine of truth, and that the truth of doctrine becomes good and comes to be of love and charity when from doctrine it passes into life. [2] This doctrine that is here signified by “the son, a male” is especially the doctrine of love to the Lord and of charity towards the neighbor, thus the doctrine of the good of life, which nevertheless is still the doctrine of truth. That the doctrine of the good of love, and thus of life, is here signified by “the son, a male” can be seen from this, that “the woman” who brought forth the son was seen “arrayed with the sun, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars,” and “the sun” signifies love to the Lord, and “the crown of twelve stars,” signifies the knowledges of good and truth, and from such a woman and mother nothing else is begotten except what pertains to love and good, thus the doctrine respecting these; this, therefore, is “the son, a male.” [3] This doctrine24 is for the new church that is called the New Jerusalem, because “the woman” treated of in this chapter is the one who is called “the bride, the Lamb’s wife,” which was “the holy city Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from God” (Rev. 21:9–10). This is why she was seen “arrayed with the sun”; “the sun” meaning the Lord in relation to Divine love (see above, n. 401, 525, 527, 708). “The son, a male” signifies the doctrine of the church, for the reason also that in the Word “son” signifies truth, and the doctrine of the church is truth in the whole complex.

(Respecting “woman” see above, n. 707; the “womb,” n. 710; and “to bring forth,” n. 721.) From this it follows that “sons and daughters,” since they are births, signify the truths and goods of the church, “sons” its truths, and “daughters” its goods; in a word, that all terms pertaining to marriage and thus to procreation on the earth signify such things as pertain to the marriage of good and truth, thus “father,” “mother,” “sons,” “daughters,” “sons-in-law,” “daughters-in-law,” “grandsons,” and others, signify goods and truths procreating, and goods and truths procreated, and furthermore goods and truths derived in their order. [4] But it is to be known that procreating goods and truths are in the spiritual man, and procreated goods and truths are in the natural man, and that those in the spiritual man are like the father and mother, and those that are from these in the natural man are like brothers and sisters; and again that truths and goods that are procreated anew as if from sons married within marriageable limits, and from daughters married within the same, are in the natural man, after these as parents have been raised up into the spiritual man; for all conception and all bearing or gestation in the womb takes place in the spiritual man, while the birth itself takes place in the natural man. Thus the spiritual man is continually enriched by the elevation into it of truths and goods out of the natural man, which as parents will procreate anew; and there all things are associated like the societies of heaven according to the affections of truth and good, and their relationships and affinities. Thence it is evident that these spiritual procreations, like the natural procreations from a father and mother, are multiplied like families and houses on earth, and are made fruitful like trees from seeds, from which are gardens that are called paradises in the spiritual"

[5] But as “sons” are mentioned in many passages in the Word, and it has not yet been known that they signify the truths of the church and of doctrine, out of many I will merely cite the following passages in the way of confirmation. In the Gospels: Jesus said, He that leaveth houses, brethren, sisters, father, mother, wife, children, fields, for My name’s sake, shall receive a hundredfold, and shall inherit eternal life (Matt. 19:29; Mark 10:29, 30). Any man that cometh unto Me, and hateth not his own father, mother, wife, children, brethren, and sisters, yea, his own soul, is not My disciple (Luke 14:26). Who cannot see that father, mother, wife, children, brethren, and sisters, also houses and fields, are not here meant, but such things as belong to man himself, and are called his own? For these things a man must leave and hate, if he wishes to worship the Lord and to be His disciple, and to “receive a hundredfold,” and “to inherit eternal life.” The things that are a man’s own are those that are of his love, and thus of his life into which he was born, consequently they are evils and falsities of every kind; and as these are of his love and life it is said that “he must hate his own soul.” These evils and falsities are signified by “father and mother, wife, children, brethren, and sisters”; for all things that are of man’s love and life, or that are of affection and thought therefrom, or of the will and the understanding therefrom, are formed and conjoined like generations descending from one father and one mother, and are also distinguished as into families and houses. The love of self and the consequent love of the world are their “father and mother,” and the cupidities arising therefrom and their evils and falsities are the “children,” which are “brethren and sisters.” That this is the meaning can be clearly seen from this, that the Lord does not wish to have anyone hate his father and mother, or wife or children, or brethren or sisters, since this would be contrary to the spiritual love implanted in everyone from heaven, which is the love of parents for children and of children for parents, and contrary to conjugial love,"

That this is not to be understood according to the letter is clear from what precedes, where Jesus says that He came not to give peace upon the earth but division, and that “there shall be five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three,” which signifies that falsities and evils will combat against truths and goods, and truths and goods against falsities and evils, which is done when man comes into temptations and is being reformed; this combat is signified by “division” and “rising up against”; that “the father shall be divided against the son and the son against the father” signifies that evil will fight against truth and truth against evil, “father” here meaning the evil that is man’s own, and “son” the truth that man has from the Lord. That the cupidity of falsity will fight against the affection of truth, and the affection of truth against the cupidity of falsity, is signified by “the mother shall be divided against the daughter, and the daughter against the mother,” “mother” here meaning the cupidity of falsity, “daughter” the affection of truth; and so on."

And in Malachi: I will send to you Elijah the prophet before the great and terrible day of Jehovah comes, that he may turn the heart of the fathers to the sons, and the heart of the sons to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse (Mal. 4:5, 6). John the Baptist was sent before to prepare the people for the reception of the Lord by baptism, because baptism represented and signified purification from evils and falsities, and also regeneration by the Lord by means of the Word. Unless this representation had preceded, the Lord could not have manifested Himself and have taught and lived in Judea and in Jerusalem, since the Lord was the God of heaven and earth under a human form, and He could not have been present with a nation that was in mere falsities in respect to doctrine and in mere evils in respect to life; consequently unless that nation had been prepared for the reception of the Lord by a representation of purification from falsities and evils by baptism, it would have been destroyed by diseases of every kind by the presence of the Divine Itself; therefore this is what is signified by “lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.” That this is so is well known in the spiritual world, for those there who are in falsities and evils are direfully tormented and spiritually die at the presence of the Lord.

The washing and baptizing itself did not indeed purify them from falsities and evils, but only represented and thence signified purification from them; nevertheless, this was received in heaven as if they were themselves purified. It was thus that heaven was conjoined to the people of that church by means of the baptism of John; and when heaven was thus conjoined to them, the Lord, who was the God of heaven, could manifest Himself to them there, teach them, and abide among them: That to John went out Jerusalem and all Judea and all the region round about Jordan, and they were baptized by him in Jordan, confessing their sins (Matt. 3:5, 6); And that he said to them, O offspring of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come (Luke 3:7). That the Jews and Israelites were conjoined to heaven by means of representatives may be seen in the New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine (n. 248). This now was the reason why John was sent before to prepare a way for the Lord, and to prepare the people for Him. And from this it may be concluded what “turning the heart of the fathers to the sons and the heart of the sons to the fathers” signifies, namely, that it means inducing a representation of the conjunction of spiritual goods with truths and truths with goods, thus of regeneration by the Lord by means of the Word. For regeneration is the conjunction of goods with truths and of truths with goods, and it is the Lord who regenerates, and the Word that teaches.

Doctrine from truths is signified by “quiver,” because it is signified by “bow,” and because those who are in doctrine from these truths fear nothing from falsities, it is said, “happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them; they shall not be ashamed when they shall speak with the enemies in the gate”; “not ashamed” meaning not to be conquered, and “enemies in the gate” the falsities of evil which are from hell.

[12] In Micah: Make thee bald and poll thee, because of the sons of thy delights, enlarge thy baldness as the eagle, for they have departed from thee (Mic. 1:16). Mourning because the truths of the church are destroyed is described by “making bald,” “enlarging baldness,” and “polling themselves,” for the “hair” signifies truths in ultimates, and those who are without truths in ultimates are also without internal truths; for this reason those in the spiritual world who have no truths from good appear bald. That truths are destroyed is signified by “the sons of thy delights have departed from thee”; they are called “sons of delight” from love of the truths and the consequent delights. [13] In Zechariah: He saw two olive trees at the right hand of the lampstand and at the left, and he said, These are the two sons of the olive standing by the Lord of the whole earth (Zech. 4:11, 14)."

[14] In the same: I will bend Judah for me, I will fill Ephraim with the bow, and I will stir up thy sons, O Zion, with thy sons, O Javan; and I will set thee as the sword of a mighty one (Zech. 9:13). “The sons of Zion” and “the sons of Javan” signify the truths of the Word internal and external, “the sons of Zion” internal truths, and “the sons of Javan” external truths (what the rest signifies see above, n. 357a, 443b, where it is explained). Because “sons” signify truths it is said that “they shall be set as the sword of a mighty one”; “the sword of a mighty one” signifying truth powerfully destroying falsity. [15] In Isaiah: I will stir up against them the Medes, whose bows will dash in pieces the young men, and they will have no pity on the fruit of the belly, their eye will not spare the sons (Isa. 13:17, 18). Because the “Medes” mean those who make no account of the truths and goods of the church, it is said “their eye will not spare the sons,” “sons” meaning the truths of the Word and of the church.

[17] In the same: Behold, I will bring back the captivity of Jacob’s tents, and will have compassion on his habitations, that the city may be built on her own heap, and the palace shall be inhabited after its own manner; and his sons shall be as of old, and his congregation shall be established before Me (Jer. 30:18, 20). “Jacob’s tents and habitations” signify all things of the church and of its doctrine, “tents” its goods, and “habitations” its truths; their “captivity” signifies spiritual captivity, which exists when the truths and goods of the Word cannot be perceived because of the falsities which rule. To disperse falsities and to teach truths is signified by “bringing back the captivity”; “that the city may be built on her own heap” signifies doctrine from truths which has become a ruin through falsities, “city” meaning doctrine; “and the palace shall be inhabited after its own manner” signifies the spiritual understanding of truths, as with the ancients, “palace” meaning the understanding of spiritual truths, for in the understanding are spiritual truths in their forms, which, when they are so presented as to be seen, appear like palaces; “his sons shall be as of old, and his congregation shall be established before Me,” signifies that the truths of the church shall remain as with the ancients, and that their forms shall remain, as with the ancients, in restored conjunction, “sons” here meaning truths, and “congregation” their conjunction and such arrangement into forms as exists in the understanding of the man of the church, from which he has intelligence; “after its own manner” and “as of old” mean as with the ancients."

Mourning because the church is laid waste is meant by “mine eye floweth down with waters”; its devastation in respect to truths is signified by “my sons are laid waste”; that this was done by the falsities of evil is signified by “the adversary hath prevailed,” “adversary” meaning the falsity of evil and the hell from which it springs. 724d.

This is not said of Jacob’s posterity, but of the Gentiles of whom the church is to be formed. “Jacob and his seed” mean those who will be of that church; that it is to be formed of those in falsities from ignorance, and thence in obscurity in respect to truths, is signified by “I will gather thee from the west, and I will say to the north, Give up”; and that these are not to be repulsed, but must be accepted, by those who are in the good of love and in the truths of doctrine in their clearness, is signified by “I will bring thy seed from the east, and I will say to the south, Hold not back”; “the east” signifying the good of love in clearness; “the south” the truth of doctrine in clearness; “the west” the good of love in obscurity, and “the north” the truth of doctrine in obscurity, such as those have who are in falsities from ignorance of truth and yet desire truths. This is the signification of these quarters, because all in the spiritual world dwell in these quarters distinctly according to the light of truth and the affection of good.

This describes in the spiritual sense the devastation of all things of the church with the Israelites; “the nation from afar” signifies the falsity of evil, which is the falsity of the sensual man, destroying truths; “harvest,” “bread,” “sons,” “daughters,” “flock,” “herd,” “vine,” and “fig tree,” which that nation will eat up, signify all things of the church; “harvest and bread” its truths and goods in respect to nourishment; “sons and daughters” its truths and goods in respect to generations; “flock and herd” truths and goods spiritual and natural; “vine and fig tree” the internal and external spiritual church from these.

[30] We read also that “they led away their sons to idols to be devoured,” and “for food,” and “to pass through fire,” as in the following passages.

The spiritual sense is such because the idea of person limits thought and its extension into heaven in every direction; for all thought that proceeds from the affection of truth makes its way through heaven in all directions, and has no termination except as light has in shade; but when person is at the same time thought of, the idea has its termination where the person is, and intelligence with it; this is why “sons” signify in the spiritual sense truths or falsities regarded abstractly. 725a. “A son, a male” signifies the doctrine of truth for the church which is called “the New Jerusalem,” because “son” signifies truth (as has been shown just above), and “a son, a male” signifies the truth of doctrine from the Word, consequently the doctrine of genuine truth which is for the church. It means the doctrine for the church which is called the New Jerusalem, because “the woman that brought forth a son, a male” means that church (as has also been shown above). The doctrine of truth which is for the church is also signified by “male” in the following passages. In Moses: God created man into His image, into the image of God created He him. Male and female created He them (Gen. 1:27). Male and female created He them, and blessed them, and called their name Man, in the day when they were created (Gen. 5:2).

From this it is clear that “Man,” who is called “Adam and Eve,” means that church, for it is said “male and female created He them, and called their name Man”; and as that church is meant by the two, it follows that “the male” means its truth, and “the female” its good, so too, “male” means doctrine, and “female,” the life, since the doctrine of truth is also the doctrine of love and charity, thus the doctrine of life; and the life of good is also the life of love and charity, thus the life of doctrine, that is, life according to doctrine. These two are meant by “male [and female],” and these taken together and conjoined in marriage are called “Man” [Homo], and also constitute the church, which is meant by “Man,” as has been said above. So, again, Adam is from a word that means ground, and ground from its reception of seeds signifies the church in respect to the truths of doctrine, for in the Word seeds signify truths; while Eve is from a word that means life, as it is said: Because she was to be the mother of all living (Gen. 3:20). These two, doctrine and life, when taken together and joined as it were in marriage, are called “Man,” and also constitute the church, because man is man from the understanding of truth and from the will of good, consequently from the doctrine of life, since this is of the understanding, and from the life of doctrine, because this is of the will. It is similar with the church, for the church is in man, and is the man himself. [3] That these two, which are signified by “male and female,” are not to be two but one, the Lord teaches in the Gospels: Jesus said, Have ye not read that He who made them from the beginning of creation made them male and female, and they twain shall be one flesh? Therefore they are no more twain, but one flesh (Matt. 19:4–6; Mark 10:6, 8)."

Here, as above, “male and female” signify in the spiritual sense truth and good, consequently the doctrine of truth, which is the doctrine of life, and the life of truth, which is the life of doctrine; these must be not two but one, since truth does not become truth with man without the good of life, nor does good become good with anyone without the truth of doctrine, for good becomes spiritual good only by means of truths, and spiritual good is good, but natural good without it is not good. When these are one, then truth is of good and good is of truth, and this one is meant by “one flesh.” It is similar with doctrine and life; these also constitute one man of the church when the doctrine of life and the life of doctrine are conjoined with him, for doctrine teaches how one must live and do, and life lives the doctrine and does it. From this it can also be seen that “a son, a male” signifies the doctrine of love and charity, consequently the doctrine of life. 725b. [4] Since the truth of doctrine or the doctrine of truth is signified by the “male,” the law was given: That every male opening the womb should be holy to Jehovah (Exod. 13:12, 15; Deut. 15:19; Luke 2:23). For from the marriage of truth and good, which, as has been said above, is meant in the spiritual sense by the marriage of man and woman, truths and goods are born, consequently these are signified in that sense by “sons and daughters,” truths by “sons,” and goods by “daughters”; and as every man is reformed and regenerated by means of truths, for without truths man does not know what is good, or what is the nature of good, thus does not know the way to heaven, so truth, which is what is first born from the marriage of truth and good, was sanctified to Jehovah. This truth first born is also the doctrine of truth, for that which is first is the all in what follows, thus is in all truth, and all truth is doctrine.

This is signified by “the firstborn,” because from the good of love, which is signified by the womb and the infant in it, nothing else can be born but the good of charity; and this good does not become good until it has been formed and qualified, that is, until it is in the form in which it has its quality, and its form is called truth, and yet it is good in form. [5] From what has now been said it can be seen why it was commanded: That every male should appear three times in the year before the face of the Lord Jehovah (Exod. 23:17; 34:23; Deut. 16:16); namely, at the three feasts, which signified everything of regeneration, from its first to its last; and as everything of regeneration is effected by the truths of doctrine that are made by the Lord to be of the life, so all males, by whom truths were signified, were to present themselves before the Lord that they might be made clean by Him and afterwards be led by Him. Moreover, “three times in the year” signifies continually, and “the face of Jehovah” the Divine love, by which man is led. And this was done because “Jerusalem” signified the church in respect to doctrine, and thence also the doctrine of the church. [6] Because “burnt offerings and sacrifices” signified celestial and spiritual things, “burnt offerings” celestial things, and “sacrifices” spiritual things, the law was given: That burnt offerings should be of males without blemish, either from the flock or from the herd; but sacrifices might be either of males or females (Lev. 1:2, 3; 3:1, 6). The reasons were that celestial things are such as are of the love to the Lord, thus of the marriage of good and truth, but spiritual things are such as are of charity towards the neighbor, thus not of marriage but of the blood relationship of truth with good; and"

This is why the burnt offerings were “of males without blemish,” which signify genuine truths from the Word, or from doctrine out of the Word, which have been conjoined to the good of love to the Lord, which good was signified by “the altar and its fire.” The sacrifices were “either of males or females,” because “males” signified truths, and “females” goods, conjoined not by marriage but by blood relationship; and as both of these, like brothers and sisters, are of one parent, worship was equally well pleasing from truths and from goods, that is, from males and from females. [7] As all spiritual nourishment is from truths that are from good, the law was also given: That the male among the priests might eat the holy things (Lev. 6:18, 29; 7:6). This was the law because “males” signify the truths of doctrine, which are doctrinals, as above, and “priests” the goods of love, which are the goods of life, and “their eating of the holy things” that belonged to Aaron and his sons signified spiritual nourishment. [8] In Moses: When thou draw near unto a city to fight against it, thou shalt invite it to peace; if it does not accept, thou shalt smite every male thereof with the edge of the sword, but the women, the little ones, the beasts, and the prey thou shalt take (Deut. 20:10–14). Every male in a city that did not accept peace should be smitten with the edge of the sword, but not the women, little ones, and beasts, because “city” signifies doctrine, and “a city of the nations in the land of Canaan” the doctrine of falsity, likewise the males of that city; and “not to accept peace” signifies not to agree with the truths and goods of the church, which were signified by “the sons"

And because falsities alone fight against truths and goods and destroy them, but not evils without falsities, “the women, little ones, and beasts,” which, with the nations, signified evils, were not smitten, since evils can be subdued, amended, and reformed by means of truths. [9] In Jeremiah: Cursed be the man who brought glad tidings to his father, saying, A son, a male is born to thee, in gladdening he hath made him glad; let that man be as the cities that Jehovah overthrew (Jer. 20:15, 16). This is said of those who are in the devastated church, in which nothing but falsities rule and are accepted; therefore “cursed be the man who brought glad tidings to his father, saying, A male is born to thee,” signifies one who acknowledges falsity and proclaims it as truth, thus the doctrine of falsity in place of the doctrine of truth; “in gladdening he hath made him glad” signifies the accepting from affection of falsity; “let that man be as the cities that Jehovah overthrew” signifies that it shall be with the doctrines that are from mere falsities, which the Lord exterminated from the church, and as with the cities of the Canaanitish nation that He destroyed; the comparison is with cities because “cities” signify doctrines. [10] In Ezekiel: Thou didst take the vessels of thine adorning, of My gold and of My silver which I had given to thee, and madest for thee images of a male with which thou didst commit whoredom (Ezek. 16:17). This is said of “the abominations of Jerusalem,” which signify the falsifications and adulterations of the Word, which are made by applications to the cupidities of corporeal and earthly loves; “vessels of adorning from the gold and silver of the Lord” signify the knowledges of good and truth, which are the goods and truths of"

[11] In Malachi: Cursed be the defrauder in whose flock is a male and he voweth and sacrificeth to the Lord a corrupted thing (Mal. 1:14). “A male in the flock” signifies the genuine truth of doctrine from the Word; “a corrupted thing” signifies what is falsified; and “to vow and sacrifice” signifies to worship, thus from things falsified when truth is known; that this worship being fraudulent is infernal is signified by “cursed be the defrauder.” From what has now been shown from the Word respecting the signification of “male” and of “sons,” it can be seen that “the son, a male that was brought forth by the woman arrayed with the sun, and upon whose head was a crown of twelve stars,” signifies the doctrine of truth, thus the doctrine of love and charity for the church which is called the New Jerusalem (which is treated of in the twenty-first chapter of this book). 726.

Under these, again, He has hid away the hells, as many in number as the heavens. And to each and every thing in the worlds of nature and in the worlds above nature He alone gives life; and because He alone gives life, no angel, spirit, or man is able to move a hand or foot except from Him. What infinite power the Lord has is especially evident from this, that all who come from so many earths into the spiritual worlds, numbering some myriads every week from our earth alone, consequently so many myri ads from so many thousand earths in the universe, the Lord alone receives, and by a thousand secret ways of Divine wisdom leads everyone to the place of his life; the faithful to their places in the heavens, and the unfaithful to their places in the hells; and the thoughts, intentions, and wills of all, everywhere He rules in most particular and in most universal things; and He causes each and every one in the heavens to enjoy their happiness, and each and every one in the hells to be held in their bonds, even so that not one of them ventures to lift a hand, much less to rise up to do harm to any angel; and all are thus held in order and in bonds, howsoever the heavens and the hells may be multiplied to eternity.

But that it may be known that the Lord has infinite power through Divine truth, something must be said of its essence and existence. This cannot be comprehended from the natural man and its light but by means of such things as proceed from the sun of the world, from which and by which that sun has all power in its world and in the earths that are under its heat and light. From the sun of our world auras and atmospheres proceed as from their fountain; these are called ethers and airs. From this source nearest about it is pure ether, at a greater distance from it are less pure ethers, and at length airs; but these ethers and airs are around the earths. These ethers and airs when made active in mass produce heat, but when modified in their least parts give light. Through these the sun exercises all its power and produces all its effect outside of itself, thus through ethers and airs by heat as a means and at the same time by light as a means. [4] From this some idea can be formed of the Lord’s infinite power through Divine truth. Likewise from Him as a sun similar auras and atmospheres emanated, but such as are spiritual, because they are from Divine love, which constitutes that sun. That there are such atmospheres in the spiritual world is clear from the respiration of angels and spirits. Those spiritual auras and atmospheres that are nearest to the Lord as a sun are the most pure; but according to the degrees in which they are removed from Him they are less and less pure. Therefore there are three heavens, the inmost heaven in a purer aura, the middle heaven in an aura less pure, and the lowest heaven in an aura still less pure. These auras or atmospheres, which are spiritual, because they have sprung from the Lord as a sun, when made active in common exhibit heat, but when modified in their least parts exhibit light. That heat, which in its essence is love, and that light, which in its essence is wisdom, are called specifically Divine truth; but together with the auras, which are also spiritual, they are called the Divine proceeding.

It can also in some degree be comprehended that the Lord has infinite power by means of the Divine proceeding, which in general is called Divine truth. This also is meant by these words in John: In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and God was the Word; all things were made by Him, and without Him was not anything made that was made. And the world was made by Him (John 1:1, 3, 10). And in David: By the Word of Jehovah were the heavens made (Ps. 33:6). “The Word” signifies Divine truth. [5] (3) All power is together in ultimates, and therefore the Lord has infinite power from first things through ultimates. What is meant by ultimates shall first be explained. First things are the things that are in the Lord, and those that most nearly proceed28 from Him; ultimates are those that are most remote from Him, that is, the things in nature, and the ultimate things in it. These are called ultimates because spiritual things, which are prior, close into them and rest and repose upon them as upon their foundation; therefore they are immovable, and are called the ultimates of Divine order. All power is in ultimates because prior things are together in them, coexisting therein in an order that is called simultaneous. For there is a connection of all things from the Lord Himself through the things which are of heaven and the things of the world even to these ultimates; and because prior things that proceed successively are together in ultimates, as has been said, it follows that power itself is in ultimates from things first.

[6] For this reason the human race is to the heavens as a base to a column, or as a foundation to a palace; consequently the heavens subsist in order upon the things of the church that are with men in the world, thus upon Divine truths in ultimates which are such Divine truths as are in the sense of the letter of the Word. What power there is in these truths cannot be told in a few words; into these ultimates with man the Lord flows in from Himself, thus from things first, and rules and keeps together in order and connection all things in the spiritual world. [7] Now because Divine power itself resides in these ultimates the Lord Himself came into the world and became Man that He might be in ultimates at the same time as in things first, to the end that through ultimates from things first, He might reduce all things to order that had become disordered, namely, all things in the hells and also all things in the heavens. This was the reason of the Lord’s coming, for at the time just before His coming there was no Divine truth in ultimates with men in the world, and none whatever in the church which was then with the Jewish nation, that had not been falsified and perverted, and consequently there was no foundation for the heavens; unless, therefore, the Lord had come into the world and had thus Himself assumed the ultimate, the heavens that were made up of the inhabitants of this earth would have been transferred elsewhere,29 and the whole human race on this earth would have perished in eternal death. But now the Lord, on the earth as in the heavens, is in His fullness, and thus in His omnipotence, because He is in ultimates and in things first. Thus the Lord is able to save all who are in Divine truths from the Word, and in a life according to them, for He can be present and dwell with such in ultimate truths from the Word, because ultimate truths are also His, and are Himself, because they are from Him, according to His words in John:"

[8] (4) So far as angels and men are recipients of Divine truth from the Lord they are powers. This can be seen from what has been said above, namely, that the Lord has infinite power, and that He alone through His Divine truth has power; also from this, that angels, and men also, are nothing but forms recipient of Divine truth; for this reason angels signify in the Word Divine truths, and are called “gods.” It therefore follows that according to the measure and quality of their reception of Divine truth from the Lord they are powers. [9] (5) Power resides in the truths of the natural man so far as it receives influx from the Lord through the spiritual man. This follows from what precedes, namely, that Divine truths in ultimates from things first have all power, and the natural man is a receptacle of ultimates. But to the natural mind of man there are two ways, one from heaven, the other from the world; the way from heaven leads through the spiritual mind into the rational and through this into the natural, and the way from the world is through the sensual which stands forth nearest to the world and clings to the body. From this it can be seen that the Lord flows in with Divine truth into the natural man only through the spiritual, and so far as the natural man receives influx therefrom is there power in it. By the power in it is meant power against the hells, which is the power to resist evils and falsities, and to put them away; and so far as these are resisted and put away man comes into angelic power and also into intelligence, and becomes “a son of the kingdom.” (On the power of angels, see in the work Heaven and Hell, n. 228–233; and on their intelligence and wisdom, n. 265–275.)

This is still more true of an “iron rod,” because iron likewise signifies the truth of the natural man, and because of its hardness it signifies power that cannot be resisted. That “rods and staffs” thence signify the power of Divine truth is derived from correspondence. Therefore in the spiritual world, where all things that appear are correspondences, the use of staffs is a representative of the power of those that use them. It was similar in the Jewish church, which, like the ancient churches, was a representative church. This is why Moses wrought miracles and signs in Egypt, and afterwards in the desert, by stretching forth his staff, as that: The waters smitten with the staff were turned into blood (Exod. 7:1–21). Frogs came up from the rivers and pools, over which the staff was stretched forth (Exod. 8:1 et seq.). From the dust smitten with the staff there came lice (Exod. 8:12 et seq.).

Joshua prevailed over Amalek when Moses held up his hand with the staff, and Amalek prevailed when Moses let it down (Exod. 17:9–12). Also fire went up out of the rock and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes which Gideon offered, when the angel of Jehovah touched it with the end of his staff (Judg. 6:21). These miracles were wrought by the stretching forth of a staff, because a “staff” from correspondence signifies the power of the Lord through Divine truth (which power was treated of in the article immediately preceding). [2] Divine truth in respect to power is signified elsewhere in the Word by “rods” and “staffs,” as can be seen from the following passages. In David: Yea, when I shall walk in the shady valley I will fear no evil to me; Thy rod and Thy staff will comfort me; Thou wilt make ready before me a table in the presence of mine enemies; and Thou wilt anoint my head with oil and my cup will abound (Ps. 23:4, 5). “To walk in a shady valley” signifies in the spiritual sense an obscure understanding that does not see truths from light; “Thy rod and Thy staff will comfort me” signifies that spiritual Divine truth together with natural Divine truth will protect, for these have power; “rod” meaning spiritual Divine truth, “staff” natural Divine truth, the two together meaning these in respect to their power to protect, for “to comfort” means to protect. As “rod and staff” signify Divine truth in respect to power, it is next said, “Thou wilt make ready before me a table, Thou wilt anoint my head with oil, my cup will abound,” which signifies spiritual nourishment through Divine truth; for “to make ready a table” signifies to be"

This was done because they murmured against Jehovah, that is, against the Lord, and indeed against Divine truth which is from Him; for Moses and Aaron represented the Lord in respect to the law, which is the Word; for this reason it was commanded that “the princes of the twelve tribes should place their staffs in the Tent of meeting before the testimony”; for “the twelve tribes,” and in particular “their princes,” and likewise “their twelve staffs,” signified the truths of the church in the whole complex; and “Tent of meeting” represented and thence signified heaven, from which are the truths of the church, and the “testimony” the Lord Himself. “The staff of Aaron” blossomed and brought forth almonds, because his “staff” represented and thence signified truth from the good of love; and because truth from the good of love alone brings"

It is to be known that “tribe” and “staff” are expressed by the same word (as in Num. 1:16; 2:5, 7); therefore “the twelve staffs” have a like signification as “the twelve tribes,” namely, the Divine truth of the church in the whole complex. (On the twelve tribes see above, n. 39, 430a, 431, 657.) [12] As a “staff” signifies the power of Divine truth, it signifies also the power to resist evils and falsities. In Isaiah: Behold the Lord Jehovih of Hosts doth take away from Jerusalem and from Judah the staff and the stay, the whole staff of bread, and the whole staff of water, the mighty one and the man of war, the judge and the prophet (Isa. 3:1, 2). Here “to take away the whole staff of bread and the whole staff of water” signifies to take away every good and truth of the church, and when these are taken away there is no longer any power to resist evils and falsities, so as to hinder their free entrance; “bread” signifies the good of the church, “water” its truth, and “staff” the same as to their power to resist evils and falsities; therefore it follows that “the mighty one and the man of war, the judge and the prophet” will also be taken away, “the mighty one and the man of war” signifying truth combating against evil and falsity, and “judge and prophet” the doctrine of good and truth. [13] In Ezekiel: Behold I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem, and they shall eat bread by weight and in carefulness, and drink waters by measure and with astonishment (Ezek. 4:16). “To break the staff of bread” signifies that good and truth shall fail in the church, for “bread” here signifies good and truth; therefore it follows “they shall eat bread by weight and in carefulness, and drink waters by measure,” which signifies a lack of good and truth, and thus of the power to resist evils and falsities:"

In this sense “rod and staff” are mentioned in the following passages. In Isaiah: Jehovah has broken the staff of the wicked, the rod of them that rule (Isa. 14:5). “To break the staff of the wicked” signifies to destroy the power of falsity from evil; and “to break the rod of them that rule” signifies to destroy the rule of falsity. [15] In David: The staff of wickedness shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous, that the righteous put not forth their hands to perversity (Ps. 125:3). “The staff of wickedness” signifies the power of falsity from evil; “upon the lot of the righteous” signifies over truths from good, which the faithful have, and especially with those who are in love to the Lord, for these in the Word are called the “righteous”; “lest the righteous put forth their hands to perversity” signifies lest they falsify truths. [16] In Lamentations: I am the man that hath seen affliction by the rod of His fury; He hath led me in darkness, and not into light (Lam. 3:1, 2).

The evil by which they were oppressed and the falsities by which they were infested are signified by “the yoke of the burden, the staff of the shoulder, and the rod of the exactor,” “to break” signifies to destroy these, for “to break” is predicated of a yoke, a staff, and a rod, and to destroy, of evil and falsity, which heavily weigh upon and powerfully persuade and compel to obedience.

[20] In Isaiah: Woe to Asshur, the rod of Mine anger and the staff of Mine indignation, which is in their hand; O My people that dwellest in Zion, fear not Asshur that he smite thee with a rod, and lift up his staff upon thee in the way of Egypt (Isa. 10:5, 24, 26). Here, too, “Asshur” signifies the reasonings from self-intelligence by which truths are perverted and falsified; the consequent falsities and the perversions of truth are signified by “the rod of Mine anger and the staff of Mine indignation, which is in their hand.” That truths will not be perverted with those of the church who are in celestial love and in truths therefrom is signified by “Thou that dwellest in Zion, fear not.” That falsity urges and excites and strives to pervert by means of such things as pertain to the natural man is signified by “that he smite thee with a rod, and lift up a staff upon thee in the way of Egypt,” “the way of Egypt,” signifying the knowledges of the natural man, from which come reasonings. Since “Egypt” signifies the natural man with the things that are in it, and the natural man when separated from the spiritual is in mere falsities: Egypt is called the staff of a bruised reed, which goeth into and pierceth the hand when one leaneth upon it (Ezek. 29:6, 7; Isa. 36:6).

That “Philistia should not be glad because the rod of him that smiteth her is broken” signifies that she should not boast that the dominion of that falsity is not yet destroyed. [22] In Hosea: My people question the wood, and their staff answereth them, for the spirit of whoredoms hath seduced them, and they have committed whoredom under their God (Hos. 4:12). This is said of the falsification of the Word. “To question the wood or an idol of wood” signifies to consult the intelligence that is from what is one’s own that favors its loves; “the staff answereth them” signifies the falsity in which one has faith, for when the selfhood is consulted falsity responds; the selfhood is of the will, thus of the love, and the falsity thence is of the understanding, thus of the thought. “The spirit of whoredoms that has seduced” signifies the lust of falsifying; “to commit whoredom under their God” signifies to falsify the truths of the Word. [23] From this now it is clear what “rod and staff” signify in both senses; and from this it can be known what is meant by “the iron rod with which the son, the male is to tend all nations”; likewise by these words in Revelation: Out of the mouth of Him who sat upon the white horse goeth forth a sharp sword, that with it He may smite the nations; and He shall tend them with an iron rod (Rev. 19:15).

This is evident from the signification of “the offspring” (or the son, a male) brought forth by “the woman arrayed with the sun, under whose feet was the moon, and upon whose head was a crown of twelve stars,” as being doctrine from the Word, and indeed, the doctrine of truth, that is, the doctrine of love to the Lord and of charity towards the neighbor, and finally of faith.

That protection by the Lord from those who are meant by “the dragon” is here signified by these words. And as that doctrine was to be the doctrine of the church that is called the New Jerusalem, therefore it is said protection because it is for the new church. It is said “caught up unto God and His throne,” “God” meaning the Lord, and “His throne” heaven; it is caught up to the Lord and to heaven because this doctrine is from the Lord, and heaven is in this doctrine.

Because the Lord foresaw that this spiritual perception would perish with their posterity, and with that perception also the knowledge of correspondences through which the human race has conjunction with heaven, therefore the Lord provided that some of those who lived with the most ancient people should collect together the correspondences, and gather them into a manuscript; these are here meant by “Enoch,” and that manuscript is what is here signified. Because that manuscript was to serve the coming churches that were to be established by the Lord after the deluge with the knowledge and cognition of the spiritual things that are in natural things, it was preserved by the Lord for their use, and was also guarded, lest the last posterity of the most ancient church, who were evil, should offer injury to it.

From this it is clear what these words involve, namely, that the new church that is called the Holy Jerusalem, which is signified by “the woman,” can as yet be instituted only with a few, by reason that the former church is become a wilderness; and the church is called a “wilderness” when there is no longer any good; and where there is no good there are no truths. When the church is such, evils and falsities reign, which hinder the reception of its doctrine, that is, the doctrine of love to the Lord and of charity towards the neighbor, with its truths; and when doctrine is not received there is no church, for the church is from doctrine. [2] Something shall first be said of there being no truths where there is no good. By good is meant the good of the life according to the truths of doctrine from the Word. The reason is because the Lord never flows immediately into truths with man, but mediately through his good; for good is of the will, and the will is the man himself; from the will the understanding is produced and formed; for the understanding is adjoined to the will so that what the will loves the understanding sees, and also brings forth into light; consequently if the will is not in good, but is in evil, then the influx of truth from the Lord into the understanding has no effect, for it is dissipated, because it is not loved, yea, it is perverted, and the truth is falsified. From this it is clear why the Lord does not flow immediately into man’s understanding except so far as the will is in good. With every man the Lord can enlighten the understanding, and thus flow in with Divine truths, since there is given to every man the ability to understand truth, and this for the sake of his reformation; nevertheless the Lord does not flow in, because truths do not remain except so far as the will has been reformed. Moreover, it is dangerous to so enlighten the understanding in truths as to produce belief except so far as the will acts as one with"

Furthermore, so far as truths are known and understood and are not at the same time lived, they are nothing but lifeless truths, and lifeless truths are like statues that have no life. From this it can be seen why it is that there are no truths where there is no good, that is, not in essence but only in form. [3] The man of the church at its end is such, because man then loves supremely such things as belong to the body and the world; and when these are loved supremely then the things pertaining to the Lord and heaven are not loved, for no one can serve two masters at the same time but he will love the one and hate the other, since they are opposites. For from the love of the body, which is the love of self, and from the love of the world, which is the love of riches, when these are loved above all things, evils of every kind flow forth, and from evils falsities, and these are the opposites of goods and truths, which come forth from love to the Lord and from charity towards the neighbor. These few words will make clear why it is that the woman is said “to have fled into the wilderness,” that is, among a few, because of being with those who are not in good, and thus not in truths. [4] In the Word wilderness and also solitude and waste places are mentioned in many passages, and these signify the state of the church when there is no longer any truth in it because there is no good. This state of the church is called a “wilderness” because in the spiritual world the place where those dwell who are not in truths because they are not in good is like a wilderness, where there is no verdure in the plains, nor harvest in the fields, nor fruit trees in the gardens, but a barren land, parched and dry; moreover “wilderness” signifies in the Word the state of the church with the Gentiles who are in ignorance of truth, and yet are in the good of life according to their religious principle, from which they have a desire for truths. “Wilderness” signifies also in the Word the state of those who are in temptations, because in temptations goods and truths are shut in by the evils and falsities that come forth and are presented to the mind.

(Isa. 14:16, 17) This is said of Lucifer, by whom Babylon is meant, and “to make the earth to tremble, to make kingdoms quake, and make the world a wilderness,” signifies to destroy all the truths and goods of the church; “the earth” meaning the church; “kingdoms” its truths; “world” its goods; and “wilderness” where these are not. “To destroy its cities” signifies its doctrinals, “city” signifying doctrine. The adulteration of the Word, whereby doctrine and thus the church is destroyed, is here signified by “Babylon.” [6] In the same: Upon the land of my people shall come up the thorn of the briar, yea, upon all the houses of joy in the triumphing city; for the palace shall be deserted, the multitude of the city shall be forsaken. The height and the watchtower shall be over the caves forever, a joy of wild asses, a pasture for flocks (Isa. 32:13, 14). “Upon the land of my people shall come up the thorn of the briar” signifies the falsity of evil in the church; “the thorn of the briar” meaning the falsity of evil, and “land” the church. “Upon all the houses of joy in the triumphing city” signifies where the goods and truths of the doctrine from the Word have been received with affection. But what is signified by “the palace shall be deserted, the multitude of the city shall be forsaken, the height and the watchtower shall be over the caves, a joy of wild asses, and a pasture for flocks,” may be seen above (n. 410c), where it is explained."

That at the end of the church the love of self and the consequent pride of self-intelligence consume all its goods and truths is signified by “a fire devoureth before him, and behind him a flame kindleth,” “fire” signifying the love of self, and “flame” the pride of self-intelligence, as above. “The land is as the garden of Eden before him, but behind him a wilderness of wasteness,” signifies that in the beginning, when that church was established with the ancients, there was an understanding of truth from good, but at its end falsity from evil; “the garden of Eden” signifying the understanding of truth from good and the consequent wisdom, and “wilderness of wasteness” signifying no understanding of truth from good, and consequent insanity from falsities that are from evil; “nothing escaped him” signifies that there is nothing whatever of truth from good.

[16] In Jeremiah: Because the land is full of adulterers, because the land mourneth on account of cursing, the pastures of the wilderness are dried up (Jer. 23:10). “The land full of adulterers” signifies the church which has its goods and truths from the Word adulterated; the “curse” on account of which the land mourneth, signifies all the evil of life and falsity of doctrine; and “the pastures of the wilderness that are dried up” signify the knowledges of good and truth from the Word; “pastures” meaning such knowledges because they nourish the mind, and “wilderness” signifies the Word when it is adulterated. [17] In David: Jehovah maketh rivers into a wilderness, and the springs of water into dryness, a land of fruit into saltness, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein (Ps. 107:33, 34). “The rivers that are made into a wilderness” signify intelligence from the understanding of truth and also of the Word in its interior sense, that has been devastated by falsities from evil; “rivers” meaning such things as belong to intelligence, and “wilderness” where these things are absent, and in their place are the falsities from evil. “The springs of water that are turned into dryness” signify that the lowest things of the understanding, which are called the knowledges of truth and good, have no light of truth or spiritual affection for it; “waters” signifying truths; “dryness”"

This describes the adulteration and falsification of the Word, which are signified by “being defiled and committing whoredom”; so “Lift up thine eyes unto the hills, and see where thou hast been defiled,” signifies to give thought to the knowledges of truth and good in the Word, that they have been adulterated; “to lift up the eyes” signifies to give thought, “hills” signify those knowledges because the groves and trees that are upon them signify knowledges; “hills” signify also the goods of charity which are so destroyed; “upon the ways hast thou sat as an Arabian in the wilderness” signifies to lie in wait, lest any truth should come forth and be received; “ways” meaning the truths of the church; “to sit in them” meaning to lie in wait, and “an Arabian in the wilderness” meaning one who kills and plunders like a robber in the wilderness. “Thou hast profaned the land with thy whoredoms and wickedness” signifies the falsification of the truths of the Word by evils that have come to be of the life.

(That “Judah” signifies the celestial church, and also the Word, see above, n. 211, 433c; and that “shedding innocent blood” signifies to do violence to Divine truth, thus to adulterate the truth of the Word, n. 329.) The adulteration of the Word is effected by the knowledges of the natural man when these are applied to confirm falsities and evils, and the natural man becomes a “waste” and a “wilderness” when his knowledges are used to confirm falsity and evil; “Egypt” signifies such knowledges, and “Edom” the pride that falsifies by means of these. [21] In Malachi: Esau I hated, and made his mountains a waste and his heritage for the dragons of the wilderness (Mal. 1:3). “Esau” signifies the love of the natural man; “his mountains” signify the evils from that love, and “his heritage” signifies the falsities from those evils, and “the dragons of the desert” signify mere falsifications from which these come."

So also the Lord says of “Jerusalem,” which means the church in respect to doctrine: Your house is left deserted (Luke 13:35). “A house deserted” signifies the church that is without truths because it is without good. But what is signified by the following in Matthew: If they say unto you, Lo, Christ is in the wilderness, go not forth; if in the secret chambers, believe not (Matt. 24:26); may be seen explained in Arcana Coelestia (n. 3900); for “Christ” means the Lord in relation to Divine truth, consequently in relation to the Word and to doctrine from the Word, and “false Christs,” of whom this is said, signify the falsities of doctrine from the truths of the Word falsified. From the passages that have been cited from the Word it can be seen that “wilderness” means the church in which there are no truths because there is no good, consequently in which there is falsity because there is evil; for where there is no truth and good, there is falsity and evil; the two"

In Isaiah: The spirit shall be poured out upon you32 from on high; then the wilderness shall be a fruitful field, and the fruitful field shall be esteemed a forest; judgment shall dwell in the wilderness, and justice shall abide in the fruitful field (Isa. 32:15, 16). This is said of those who are in natural good, and are being reformed; influx out of heaven into such is signified by “the spirit shall be poured out upon you33 from on high”; that truth from a spiritual origin will then be implanted in them is signified by “the wilderness shall be a fruitful field”; “wilderness” meaning the natural man destitute of truths, and “fruitful field” (or land of harvest) the natural man made fruitful by truths. That in consequence the natural man will have a knowledge of the cognitions of truth and good is signified by “the fruitful field shall be esteemed a forest”; “forest” is predicated of the natural man as “garden” is of the spiritual, therefore a “forest” signifies knowledge and a “garden” intelligence; that in consequence there will be in the natural man that which is right and just is signified by “judgment shall dwell in the wilderness, and justice shall abide in the fruitful field”; “judgment” and “justice” signify in the spiritual sense truth and good, but in the natural sense that which is right and just.

This, too, is said of the new church to be established by the Lord among the Gentiles. The “wilderness” signifies the state of the church with those who are ignorant of truth, and yet have a desire to know it. But what the particulars signify in the spiritual sense may be seen explained above (n. 518a). [27] In the same: Jehovah will comfort Zion, He will comfort all her waste places, and He will make her wilderness as Eden, and her solitude like the garden of Jehovah; joy and gladness will be found therein, confession and the voice of singing (Isa. 51:3).

(But this may be seen explained above, n. 721b.)

[29] In Isaiah: Let them sing praise, the end of the earth, those that go down to the sea, and its fullness, the islands and the inhabitants thereof. Let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up the voice, the villages that Arabia doth inhabit; let the inhabitants of the rock sing, let them cry out from the head of the mountains (Isa. 42:10, 11). This is said of a church with those who were remote from the truths of the church because they were natural and sensual; their state of ignorance is meant by the “wilderness,” and their joy from the preaching and the knowledge of truth is signified by “singing praise and lifting up the voice.” (The rest may be seen explained above, n. 406b.) [30] Since the state of ignorance of truth, in which the Gentiles have been, is signified by a “wilderness,” and the desire for truth by “hunger,” and instruction by the Lord by “feeding,” it came to pass that the Lord withdrew into the wilderness, and there taught the multitude that sought Him, and afterwards fed them.

From these and the passages cited above it is evident that a “wilderness” signifies an uncultivated and uninhabited state with man, thus a state not yet made vital from what is spiritual, consequently, as applied to the church, a state not vivified by means of truths; thus it signifies such a religious principle as the Gentiles had, which was almost empty and void, because they did not have the Word where truths are, and thence did not know the Lord who teaches truths; and as they did not have truths, their good also could be no otherwise than such as the truth was with them, for good is like its truth, because one is of the other. From this it can be seen what “wilderness” signifies where the Gentiles are treated of, namely, where there is no truth and yet a desire for it that their good may be vivified. 730d. [31] (3) Again, “wilderness” signifies the state of those who are in temptations, because in them truths and goods are shut in by the falsities and evils that come forth and are presented to the mind. This can be seen from the wandering of the sons of Israel in the wilderness forty years; for this represented every state of temptations into which those come who are being regenerated, and of whom the church is to consist. Every man is born natural, and lives naturally until he becomes rational; and when he has become rational he can be led by the Lord and become spiritual; and this is effected by the implanting of the knowledges of truth from the Word, and at the same time by the opening of the spiritual mind which receives the things of heaven, and by calling forth these knowledges and elevating them out of the natural man and conjoining them with the spiritual affection of truth. This opening and conjunction is possible only through temptations, because in temptations man fights interiorly against the falsities and evils that are in the natural man. In a word, man is introduced into the church and becomes a church through temptations. This was represented by the wandering and leading about of the sons of Israel in the wilderness. The state of the natural man before he is regenerated was represented by their sojourning in the land of Egypt, for “the land of Egypt” signified the natural man and its knowledges and"

But the spiritual state, which is the state of the church with man, was represented by the introduction of the sons of Israel into the land of Canaan, for “the land of Canaan” signified the church with its truths and goods, together with its affections, and delights, which reside in such a man; while the reformation and regeneration of man before from being natural he becomes spiritual and thus a church, was represented by their wanderings and journeyings in the wilderness forty years. [32] That this is so, and that “the wilderness” signified a state of temptations, can be seen in Moses: Thou shalt remember all the way which Jehovah thy God hath led thee these forty years in the wilderness, that He might afflict thee and try thee, and know what was in thine heart whether thou wouldst keep His commandments or no; and He afflicted thee and made thee to hunger, and made thee to eat manna, which thou knewest not neither did thy fathers know; that He might teach thee that man doth not live by bread only, but by all that goeth forth from the mouth of Jehovah doth man live; thy raiment waxed not old upon thee, and thy foot swelled not, these forty years (Deut. 8:2–4). In the wilderness which thou sawest, Jehovah thy God bare thee as a man doth bear his son. He went before you in the way, to seek for you a place in which ye might encamp, in fire by night to show you the way, and in the cloud by day (Deut. 1:31, 33). Jehovah, who led thee through the great and fearful wilderness of the serpent, of the fiery serpent and of the scorpion, and of thirst, where there were no waters; who brought thee forth waters out of the rock of flint, and fed thee with manna in the wilderness, that He might afflict thee and try thee, to do thee good in thy latter end (Deut. 8:15, 16). Jehovah found Jacob in a land of wilderness, in an emptiness, a howling, a solitude; He led him about, He instructed him, He guarded him as the pupil of the eye (Deut. 32:10).

The above is meant also by “Jehovah afflicted thee and tried thee, that He might know what was in thine heart.” [35] (2) That the Lord with man fights against evils and falsities that are from hell is signified by “Jehovah found Jacob in a wilderness, in emptiness, a howling, a solitude, He guarded him as the pupil of His eye”; also by “He bare him as a man doth bear his son”; also by “He went before them in fire by night and in the cloud by day.”"

This was said in general of those who have been redeemed, and in particular of the sons of Israel in the wilderness, and these words describe the temptations of those who are being regenerated by the Lord. “The city of habitation which they found not” signifies the doctrine of life which constitutes the church in man; and as the church is formed in man by a life according to doctrine, when temptations have been passed through, it is said that “Jehovah led them in a way of straightness that they might go to a city of habitation”; the lack of truth even to despair, and yet desire for it, is signified by “they were hungry and thirsty, so that their soul was disheartened in the way.” [38] In Jeremiah: I remembered thy youth, the love of thine espousals, when thou wentest after Me in the wilderness.

And I led you into a land of grain, to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof (Jer. 2:2, 6, 7). The “youth” and “love of espousals” that Jehovah remembered signify the state of man’s reformation and regeneration, when from being natural he becomes spiritual; because man is thereby conjoined to the Lord, and as it were espoused to Him, this is what is meant by the “love of espousals”; and because this is effected through temptations it is said, “When thou wentest after Me in the wilderness”; the state of temptations is described by “He led me in the wilderness, in a land of solitude and of the pit, in a land of drought and dense shade”; “wilderness” signifying that state; “land of solitude and of the pit” signifying that state in respect to the evils and falsities that come forth, and the “land of drought and dense shade” signifying the perception of good and the understanding of truth obscured.

Here again “wilderness” stands for a state of temptations, which state is called “a wilderness of peoples” and “the wilderness of the land of Egypt,” because the state of the natural man before regeneration is meant, which is a wilderness and a solitude because there are then no goods and truths in it, but only evils and falsities; but when falsities and evils have been exterminated therefrom, and truths and goods have been implanted in their place, from being a wilderness it becomes “Lebanon” and a “garden.” “To plead with them in the wilderness face to face” signifies to show them to the life of what quality they are and in a way that they acknowledge it; for in temptations man’s evils and falsities come forth and appear; “face to face” means to the life and so as to be acknowledged. That after man has endured hard things, conjunction with the Lord, which is reformation, takes place, is signified by “then will I cause you to pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bonds of the covenant”; “to cause to pass under the rod” meaning to endure hard things, and “the bond of the covenant” meaning conjunction with the Lord.

The “Baalim” and “lovers,” after whom she went, signify the things that belong to the natural man and are loved, namely, cupidities and falsities therefrom; that these must be removed by means of temptations is signified by “I will bring you into the wilderness”; that afterwards there will be consolation is signified by “afterwards I will speak upon her heart”; that they will then have spiritual and natural truths is signified by “I will give her vineyards thence and the valley of Achor.” That afterwards they will have influx of good out of heaven and consequent joy, as those had who were of the ancient churches and who from natural had become spiritual, is signified by “she shall make answer or sing there according to the days of her youth, and according to the days of her coming up out of the land of Egypt,” “days of youth” signifying the times of the ancient church, and “according to the days of her coming up out of Egypt,” signifying when from natural they became spiritual.

This does not mean that the Lord was tempted by the devil only forty days, and at the end of these, but that He was tempted throughout His whole life even to the last, when He endured direful anguish of heart in Gethsemane and afterwards the dreadful passion of the cross; for by means of the temptations admitted into the human that He had from the mother, the Lord subjugated all the hells, and at the same time glorified His Human. (But of these temptations of the Lord see what is written in Arcana Coelestia, and collected therefrom in the New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine, n. 201.) All these temptations of the Lord are signified by the temptations in the wilderness forty days and forty nights, since the “wilderness” signifies a state of temptations, and “forty days and forty nights” the whole duration of these. No more was written respecting these in the Gospels because no more was revealed respecting them; nevertheless in the prophets, and especially in the psalms of David, they are described at length. “The beasts” with which the Lord is said to have been, signify the infernal societies; and “fasting” signifies here such affliction as there is in the combats of temptation. 730e. [42] (4) Again, “wilderness” also signifies hell, because that is called a wilderness where there is no harvest or habitation, likewise where there are wild beasts, serpents, and dragons, which signify where there is no truth of doctrine or good of life, consequently where there are lusts from evil loves, and falsities therefrom of every kind; and as these are in hell and the former in a wilderness, so from correspondences the “wilderness” also signifies hell. Moreover, the natural man with everyone, so long as it is separated from the spiritual, as it is before regeneration, is a hell, because all the hereditary evil into which man is born resides in his natural man, and is not cast out from it, that is, removed, except by the influx of Divine truth through heaven from the Lord; and this influx into the natural man can come only through the spiritual, for the natural man is in the world and the spiritual in heaven;"

[43] How this is removed was represented by the he-goat called Azazel that was cast out into the desert; for the “he-goat” from correspondence signifies the natural man in respect to his affections and knowledges, and in the contrary sense in respect to his cupidities and falsities. Of this he-goat we read thus in Moses: That Aaron should take two he-goats and cast lots upon them, one for the he-goat to be sacrificed, the other for Azazel; and after he had expiated the Tent of meeting and the altar with the blood of the sacrificed bullock and of the sacrificed he-goat, he should lay his hands upon the head of the he-goat Azazel, and should confess upon it the iniquities and sins of the sons of Israel; which he shall put upon the head of the he-goat, and afterwards should send him by the hand of a man appointed into the wilderness. So the he-goat shall bear upon him all the iniquities of the sons of Israel into the land cut off and into the wilderness; and the skin, the flesh, and the dung of the bullock and of the sacrificed he-goat should be burned in the wilderness; thus should they be expiated and cleansed from all their sins (Lev. 16:5–34). These things were commanded to represent expiation, that is, purification from evils and falsities. Two he-goats were taken to represent this, because a “he-goat” from correspondence signifies the natural man; the he-goat that was to be sacrificed represented the natural man in reference to the part purified, and the he-goat that was to be sent into the wilderness the natural man not purified. And as the natural man swarms with cupidities and uncleanness of every kind, as has been said above, therefore that he- goat was sent out of the camp into a land cut off and into the wilderness that he might bear away the iniquities and sins of all in that church; “the land cut off and the wilderness” signifying hell. Aaron laying his hands upon its head and confessing the sins represented communication and transference, for this is done when man is purified or expiated from sins, for the sins are then sent down to hell, and the affections of good and truth are implanted in their place; these were represented in part by the fat sacrificed from the bullock and from the other he-goat, also by their blood, and especially by the burnt offering from the ram (respecting which see"

But it is to be known that the Israelitish people were not in the least purified from their sins by this, but the purification of the natural man when he was being regenerated was thus merely represented. All things of man’s regeneration were represented by such external things, especially by sacrifices; and this was done for the sake of the conjunction of heaven with that church through the externals of worship, the internals that the externals represented being seen in the heavens. Who cannot see that the sins of the whole congregation could not be transferred to a he-goat and borne by him to hell? From this it is evident what is signified by “wilderness” in its various senses. 731. Where she hath a place prepared by God, signifies the state of the church that in the meantime provision may be made for it among more. This is evident from the signification of “place,” as being state (of which presently); also from the signification of “prepared by God,” as being to be provided by the Lord, for what is done by man is prepared, but what is done by the Lord is provided. Moreover, to be provided is predicated of the state that is signified by “place,” while “to be prepared” is predicated of “place.” It signifies that the state in the meantime may be provided among more, because the woman’s fleeing into the wilderness signifies that the church is as yet among few, because with those who are not in good and consequently not in truths (see the preceding article, n. 730a ); therefore it follows that these words, namely, “where the woman hath a place prepared by God” signify the state of the church, that in the meantime provision may be made for it among more; and what next follows, namely, “that they may nourish her a thousand two hundred and sixty days,” signifies until it grows to fullness (see below, n. 732). But this state of the church that is meant by “the place of the woman in the wilderness” is more fully treated of in what follows in this chapter, for it is said that “there were given to the woman two wings of a great eagle that she might fly into the wilderness to her place, where she would be nourished a time and times and half a time from the face of the dragon,” with many other things."

These, indeed, appear there just the same as in this world, and yet they are different in this respect, that the quality of everyone is known from the place where he dwells, and where he dwells is known from what he is; thus it is in general in respect to the places of all according to quarters, and also in particular in respect to places in societies, and more particularly in respect to places in the houses, and even in the rooms. From this it is clear that place and quality of state act as one, and this for the reason that all things in the spiritual world that appear before the eyes, even to the lands, are correspondences of things spiritual; this is why “place” signifies state. (That spaces, places, and distances, are in their origin states, and thence in the Word signify states, see in the work Heaven and Hell, n. 191–199, in the article on Space in Heaven.) For the same reason it is customary in our world to designate state by place, as to have a high place, an eminent place, and a distinguished place, for a high, eminent or distinguished state. [3] From this it may appear what is meant by the Lord’s words to His disciples: That in His Father’s house there are many mansions, and that He would go to prepare a place for them; and if He should go and prepare a place for them that He would come and take them to Himself (John 14:2, 3). “To prepare a place for them” signifies to provide heaven for everyone according to the state of his life, for “the disciples” mean all who are to be of His church. And in Luke: When the unclean spirit goeth out of a man he wandereth through dry places seeking rest (Luke 11:24). “The unclean spirit going out of a man” signifies the removal of evils and the consequent falsities from man when he is repentant;"

This is evident from the signification of “a thousand two hundred and sixty days,” as being from beginning to end, and thus fullness (of which above, n. 636); for this number involves three and a half years, and “three and a half,” whether years or days, signifies fullness (see above, n. 532, 658). “That they may nourish her” so many days signifies until it grows to fullness, because this follows from what precedes, namely, that “the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God,” which signifies that the new church, which is meant by “the woman,” is at first amongst a few, that in the meantime provision may be made for it among more; therefore it is added, until it grows to fullness; moreover, “to nourish” signifies to sustain life and to grow. [2] There are several reasons why this new church that is called the Holy Jerusalem will first begin with a few, afterwards to be with more, and finally to reach fullness. First, its doctrine, which is the doctrine of love to the Lord and charity towards the neighbor, cannot be acknowledged and thus received except by those who are interiorly affected by truths, and those only can be interiorly affected by truths who have the ability to see them, and those only see truths who have cultivated their intellectual faculty, and have not destroyed it in themselves by the loves of self and of the world. A second reason is that the doctrine of that church cannot be acknowledged and thence received but by those who have not confirmed themselves by doctrine and at the same time by life in faith alone; confirmation by doctrine alone does not prevent reception, but confirmation by life also does prevent, for such do not know what love to the Lord is, nor what charity towards the neighbor is, nor are they willing to know."

The number of these in the spiritual world now increases daily, therefore according to their increase does that church that is called the New Jerusalem increase on earth. These also were the reasons why the Christian church, after the Lord had left the world, increased so slowly in Europe, and did not attain to its fullness until an age had elapsed. 733. Verses 7, 8. And there was war in heaven, Michael and his angels fought with the dragon, and the dragon fought and his angels. And they prevailed not, and their place was not found anymore in heaven. 7. “And there was war in heaven,” signifies the combat of falsity against truth, and of truth against falsity (n. 734); “Michael and his angels fought with the dragon, and the dragon fought and his angels,” signifies the combat between those who are for the life of love and charity and for the Divine of the Lord in His Human against those who are for faith alone or faith separate, and are against the Divine of the Lord in His Human (n. 735). 8. “And they prevailed not, and their place was not found anymore in heaven,” signifies that they were overcome, and that nowhere in the heavens henceforth is there a place that corresponds to the state of their life, which is a state of thought alone, and of no affection of good and truth (n. 736, 737). 734a. Verse 7. And there was war in heaven, signifies the combat of falsity against truth and of truth against falsity. This is evident from the signification of “war,” as being spiritual war, that is,37 of falsity against truth and of truth against falsity (of which presently). The falsity here meant is falsity from evil, and the truth truth from good; for there exist many kinds of falsities, but those falsities only that are from evil fight against truths from good, since evil is opposed to good, and all truth is of good.

To think of heaven and the Lord in the life is to think that this or that must be done because the Word so teaches and commands; those who do this, since they live from the Word, live from the Lord and heaven. But to think only of self and the world is to think that this or that must be done because of the laws of the country, and for the sake of reputation, honor and gain; such do not live for the Lord and heaven, but for self and the world. These in respect to life are in evil, and from evil in falsities; and those who are in falsities from this origin fight against truths. But these do not fight against the Word, for they call it holy and Divine, but they fight against the genuine truths of the Word, for they confirm their falsities from the Word, but only from the sense of its letter, which in some passages is such that it may be drawn to confirm the most heretical principles, for the reason that the Word in that sense is adapted to the apprehension of children and the simple, who for the most part are sensual, and they receive only such things as are apparent to the eyes; and as the Word is such in the letter, therefore those who are in falsities from evil of life confirm their falsities from the Word, and thus falsify the Word. Yea, they who separate faith from charity so falsify the Word that wherever mention is made of doing or of deeds and works, such passages, of which there are thousands, are explained as if nothing of doing or of deeds or works were meant, but only believing and faith; and so in other cases.

This treats of the Lord’s coming, and that those who will be of His new church are to be instructed in truths, by which they will be led to heaven. “The mountain of Jehovah” and “the house of Jacob” signify the church in which is love to the Lord and worship from that love; a summoning to that church, and thus to the Lord, is signified by “Many peoples shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to that mountain”; that they will be instructed in truths by which they will be led is signified by “He will teach us of His ways that we may go in His paths,” “ways” meaning truths and “paths” the precepts of life; that they will be led by the doctrine of the good of love and by the doctrine of truth from that good, which are for the church out of heaven from the Lord, is signified by “out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the Word from Jerusalem,” “the law” meaning the doctrine of the good of love, and “the Word” truth from that good; that evils of life and falsities of doctrine will then be dissipated is signified by “He will judge between the nations and reprove the peoples,” “nations” signifying those who are in evils, and “peoples” those who are in falsities, thus in an abstract sense evils of life and falsities of doctrine. [3] That by the consent of all, combats will then cease is signified by “they shall beat their swords into hoes and their spears into pruning hooks,” “sword” and “spear” meaning falsities from evil fighting against truths from good, and truths from good against falsities from evil; “hoes” meaning the goods of the church which are cultivated by truths, for “a field that is tilled by the hoe” means the church in respect to the good of life; and “pruning hooks” mean truths of doctrine, because trees in gardens signify the perceptions and knowledges of truths. Like things are signified by “nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war anymore,” “war” signifying combats in the whole complex."

The appearance is that such a war is there meant as David waged against his enemies, and thus that Jehovah taught him such war, and how to let down a bow of brass upon the arms; nevertheless spiritual war is meant, also a spiritual bow, which is the doctrine of truth, and “the bow of brass” means the doctrine of the good of life, and this because the Word regarded in its essence is spiritual.

Here “to fight,” “to take hold of shield and buckler,” and “to draw out the spear,” does not mean to grasp these arms of war, since this is said of Jehovah, but it is so said because all arms of war signify such things as pertain to spiritual war. A “shield,” because it protects the head, signifies protection against the falsities that destroy the understanding of truth; a “buckler,” because it protects the breast, signifies protection against the falsities that destroy charity, which is the will of good; and a “spear,” because it protects all parts of the body, signifies protection in general.

[9] Moreover, the wars that are described in the historicals of the Word, both in the books of Moses and in the books of Joshua, Judges, Samuel, and Kings, signify spiritual wars; as the wars against the Assyrians, Syrians, Egyptians, Philistines, and, in the beginning, against the idolatrous nations in the land of Canaan beyond and on this side Jordan. What these wars signify becomes evident when it is known what and of what kind are the evil and falsity signified by “the Assyrians,” “the Babylonians and the Chaldeans,” also by “the Egyptians,” “the Syrians,” “the Philistines,” and the rest; for all nations and peoples that waged war with the sons of Israel represented the hells, which were desirous of doing violence to the church represented by the sons of Israel. Nevertheless, the wars actually took place as they are described, yet they represented and thence signified spiritual wars, since nothing is said in the Word that is not inwardly spiritual, for the Word is Divine, and what proceeds from the Divine is spiritual, and is terminated in what is natural. [10] That the ancient people also had a Word, both prophetical and historical, that is now lost, is evident from Moses (Num. 21), where its prophecies are referred to, and are there called “Enunciations”; also the historical books, which are called “The Wars of Jehovah” (verses 14 and 27). Those historical books are called “The Wars of Jehovah” because they signify the wars of the Lord with the hells, as also do the wars in the historical books of our Word. This, then, is why “adversaries,” “enemies,” “assailants,” “pursuers,” “those that rise up,” as also all the arms of war, as the spear, the buckler, the shield, the sword, the bow, arrows, the chariot, signify in the Word such things as pertain to combats with the hells and protection against them."

He who does not know that there is a spiritual sense in every particular of the Word might believe that nothing more interior is here meant than what is meant in the letter; and yet “war” here as elsewhere signifies spiritual war, and therefore “horse,” “chariot,” and “much people” signify the falsities of religion in which they trust, and from which they fight against the truths of the church, “horse” meaning the falsities of the understanding and reasonings therefrom, “chariot” falsities of doctrine, and “much people” falsities in general. Whether you say falsities or those who are in falsities it amounts to the same. They were not to be afraid of these nor tremble because they were in the truths of the church from the Lord and because the Lord is in these truths with man, and thus from them fights for man against the hells, which are the enemies in the spiritual sense; therefore it is said, “for Jehovah God is with you, and goeth with you to fight for you against your enemies, to save you.” These two senses, the natural and the spiritual, make one by the correspondences that exist between all things of the world and all things of heaven; consequently there is a conjunction of heaven with man by means of the Word. But the spiritual sense that lies hidden in the historical books of the Word is less easily seen than that in the prophetical things, because the historical facts keep the mind fixed in themselves, and thus prevent its thinking anything except what appears in the letter; and still all the historical facts of the Word are representative of heavenly things, and the words are significative.

Or what man is there that hath planted a vineyard and hath not completed and gathered the fruits of it, let him go and return unto his house, lest he die in the war and another man complete and gather the fruits of it. Or what man is there that hath betrothed a wife and hath not taken her, let him go and return unto his house, lest he die in the war and another man take her. What man is fearful and soft in heart, let him go and return unto his house, lest the heart of his brethren melt as his heart (Deut. 20:5–8). That “those that had built new houses and had not yet dedicated them,” and “those that had planted vineyards and had not yet gathered the fruits of them,” and “those that had betrothed wives and had not yet taken them,” should remain at home, lest they should die in the war and other men should dedicate their houses, gather the fruits of their vineyards, and take their wives, was commanded and sanctioned from causes in the spiritual world, which no one can see unless he knows what is signified by “building a house,” “planting a vineyard,” and “taking a wife,” also by “dying in war.” “To build a house” signifies to establish the church; the like is meant by “planting a vineyard,” but a “house” signifies the church in respect to good, and a “vineyard” the church in respect to truth, for both good and truth must be implanted in man, that the church may be in him. The conjunction of these two, namely, of good and truth, is signified by “betrothing and taking a wife”; and “war” signifies spiritual war, which is combat against evils and falsities from hell; and “to die in the war” signifies to succumb before the church is implanted by these means; this is done also by means of temptations, which are also signified by “wars” in the Word. [13] From this it can be concluded what these statutes signify in the spiritual sense, namely, that the men of the church, that is, the men in whom the church is, who are signified by “the sons of Israel going out to the war,” are the ones to fight against enemies, which"

It is also said, “lest another man dedicate the house,” “gather the fruit of the vineyard,” and “take the wife,” which signifies lest falsities and evils conjoin themselves with good, or truth of another kind with the affection of good; for “another man” signifies falsity, and also other truth, thus truth that is not concordant.

The works and ministries of the Levites about the tent of meeting are called “military service” because the Levites represented the truths of the church, and Aaron, to whom the Levites were given and assigned for service, represented the Lord in relation to the good of love and in reference to the work of salvation, and as the Lord from the good of love by means of truths from the Word regenerates and saves men, and also removes the evils and falsities that are from hell, against which He continually fights, therefore the functions and ministries of the Levites were called “military service.” The same is evident from this also, that their ministries were called “military service” although the Levites did not war against the enemies of the land. This shows that the priesthood is a military service, but against falsities and evils. For the same reason the church at this day is called the church militant. [15] In Isaiah: The voice of a multitude in the mountains, like as of a great people, the voice of a tumult of the kingdoms of the nations gathered together; Jehovah of Hosts numbereth the host of war (Isa. 13:4). This may be seen explained above (n. 453b); also that “to number the host of war” signifies to arrange the truths from good against the falsities from evil, which are signified by “the kingdoms of the nations gathered together.” In the same: In that day Jehovah shall be for a spirit of judgment to him that sitteth on judgment; and for might to those who turn back the war from the gate (Isa. 28:5, 6). This is said in reference to those who are in the pride of self- intelligence, who are meant in verse 1 by “the crown of pride, the drunkards of Ephraim.” Of those who are not in that pride this is said; that they shall have intelligence from the Lord is signified by “Jehovah shall be for a spirit of judgment to him that sitteth on"

The depraved intention is further described by “thinking evils in the heart”; and perverting the truths of the Word is meant by “gathering themselves together all the day for war”; the reasonings by which they prevail are signified by “wars,” and therefore it is added, “they have sharpened their tongue like serpents.” [18] In Zechariah: They shall be as the mighty ones treading down the mire of the streets in the war, and they shall fight because Jehovah is with them, and they that ride upon horses shall be ashamed (Zech. 10:5). This treats of the Lord’s coming and of those who are in truths from good from Him; of these it is said that “they shall be as the mighty ones treading down the mire of the streets in the war,” which signifies that they will dissipate and wholly destroy the falsities of doctrine; “the mire of the streets” signifying that falsity, because a “city” signifies doctrine, “the streets of a city” its truths, and the “mire” in them falsity from truth falsified; “and they shall fight because Jehovah is with them” signifies that from the Lord they will attack and overcome those falsities; “and they that ride upon horses shall be ashamed” signifies that everything of self- intelligence will succumb; “to be ashamed” means to succumb because it is said of those who are overcome, and “to ride upon horses” signifies to trust in self-intelligence.

But ye shall hear of wars and rumors of wars; see that ye be not troubled; for nation shall be stirred up against nation and kingdom against kingdom, and there shall be famines and pestilences and earthquakes (Matt. 24:5–7; Mark 13:6–8; Luke 21:8–11).

Those who “shall come in His name and shall call themselves Christ, and shall lead many astray,” signify those who will come and say that this is divine truth, when yet it is truth falsified, which in itself is falsity; “Christ” meaning the Lord in relation to Divine truth, but here in the contrary sense Divine truth falsified. “They shall hear of wars and rumors of wars” signifies that there shall be disputes and contentions about truths, and consequent falsifications; “nation shall be stirred up against nation, and kingdom against kingdom,” signifies that evil will fight with evil and falsity with falsity, for evils never agree among themselves nor falsities among themselves; this is why churches are divided, and so many heresies have arisen; “nation” signifies those who are in evils, and “kingdom” those who are in falsities, of whom the church consists. “There shall be famines and pestilences and earthquakes” signifies that there will no longer be any knowledges of truth and good, and that the state of the church will be changed on account of the falsities that will corrupt it; “famine” meaning a deprivation of the knowledges of truth and good; “pestilences” corruptions by falsities, and “earthquakes” the changes of the church."

[26] From this it is clear what is signified by “war” in other passages of Revelation, as in the following: When the witnesses shall have finished their testimony the beast that cometh up out of the abyss shall make war with them, and overcome them and kill them (Rev. 11:7). The spirits of demons doing signs to go forth unto the kings of the earth and of all the countries of the world, to gather them together unto the war of that great day of God Almighty (Rev. 16:14). Satan shall go forth to lead astray the nations, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to war (Rev. 20:8).

That those who are in faith separated from charity, which faith is called faith alone, are meant by “the dragon,” has been shown above (n. 714–716). The same are also against the Divine of the Lord in His Human, that is, against the Divine Human, because most of those who have confirmed themselves in faith alone are merely natural and sensual, and the natural and sensual man separated from the spiritual can have no idea of the Divine in the Human, for they think of the Human of the Lord naturally and sensually, and not at the same time from any spiritual idea; therefore they think of the Lord in the same way as they think of an ordinary man altogether like themselves, and this they also teach; consequently in the idea of their thought they set the Divine of the Lord above His Human, and thus they altogether separate those two, namely the Divine and the Human of the Lord; and this they do although their doctrine, which is the doctrine of Athanasius respecting the trinity, teaches otherwise, for this teaches that the Divine and human are a united person, and that the two are one like soul and body. Let any one of them examine himself, and he will perceive that such is their idea respecting the Lord. From this it is clear what is meant by “Michael and his angels” who fought with the dragon, namely, those who acknowledge the Lord’s Divine Human and are for the life of love and charity, for they who are such cannot do otherwise than acknowledge the Divine Human of the Lord, and for the reason that otherwise they could not be in any love to the Lord nor in any charity towards the neighbor thence, since this charity and love are solely from the Lord’s Divine Human, and not from a Divine separated from His Human, nor from the Human separated from His Divine;"

From this it is clear what is meant by “Michael and his angels.” [2] As to Michael in particular, it is believed from the sense of the letter that he is one of the archangels; but there is no archangel in the heavens. There are, indeed, higher and lower angels, also wiser and less wise; and in the societies of angels there are governors who are set over the rest; but yet there are no archangels in obedience to whom others are held by any authority. There is no such government in the heavens, for no one there acknowledges in heart anyone above himself except the Lord only; this is what is meant by the Lord’s words in Matthew: Be not ye called teacher, for one is your Teacher, Christ, but all ye are brethren. And call no man your father on earth, for one is your Father, who is in the heavens. Neither be ye called masters, for one is your Master, Christ. He that is greatest among you shall be your minister (Matt. 23:8–11). But by those angels that are mentioned in the Word, as “Michael” and “Raphael,” administrations and functions are meant, and in general, limited and certain departments of the administration and function of all the angels; so here “Michael” means that department of angelic function that has been referred to above, namely, the defense of that part of the doctrine from the Word that teaches that the Lord’s Human is Divine, and that man must live a life of love to the Lord and of charity towards the neighbor that he may receive salvation from the Lord, consequently that department of function is meant that is for fighting against those who separate the Divine from the Human of the Lord, and who separate faith from the life of love and charity, and who even profess charity with the lips but not in the life.

It is the same in respect to archangels, who signify that Divine truth, as has been said above. Angels, moreover, in the heavens do not have such names as men on earth have, but they have names expressive of their functions, and in general, to every angel a name is given according to his quality; this is why “name” signifies in the Word the quality of a thing and state. The name Michael means, from its derivation in the Hebrew, “who is like God”; therefore Michael signifies the Lord in relation to that Divine truth that the Lord is God even as to the Human, and that man must live from Him, that is, in love to Him from Him, and in love towards the neighbor. Michael is mentioned also in Daniel 10:13, 21; 12:1, and signifies there like as here the genuine truth from the Word, which will be for those who are of the church to be established by the Lord; for “Michael” means those who will favor the doctrine of the New Jerusalem, the two essentials of which doctrine are, that the Human of the Lord is Divine, and that there must be a life of love and charity. [4] Michael is also mentioned in the Epistle of Jude in these words: Michael the archangel, when contending with39 the devil he disputed about the body of Moses, durst not pronounce a sentence of blasphemy, but said, The Lord rebuke thee (Jude 9). This the apostle Jude quoted from ancient books that were written by correspondences, and by “Moses” in those books the Word was meant, and by his “body” the sense of the letter of the Word; and as the same persons are meant here by “the devil” as are meant in Revelation by “the dragon,” which is also called “satan” and “the devil,” it is evident what is signified by “Michael, contending with the devil, disputed about the body of Moses,” namely, that such falsified the sense of the letter of the Word; and because the Word in the letter is such that it can be distorted by the evil from its genuine sense, and yet can be received by the good according to its meaning, it was said by the ancients, from whom these words of"

Verse 8. And they prevailed not, and their place was not found anymore in heaven, signifies that they were overcome, and that nowhere in the heavens henceforth is there a place that corresponds to the state of their life, which is a state of thought alone, and of no affection of good and truth. This is evident from the signification of “they prevailed not,” as being that they were overcome in combat; also from the signification of “their place was not found anymore in heaven,” as being that in the heavens henceforth there is no place that corresponds to the state of their life (of which presently). This does not exist henceforth, because the state of their life which is meant by “the dragon and his angels” is a state of thought alone, and of no affection of good and truth; for those who place everything of the church and thus everything of salvation in faith alone cannot be in any affection of good and truth, since such affection belongs to life. Every man has two faculties of life, which are called understanding and will; the understanding is that which thinks, and the will that which is affected, thus thought belongs to the understanding and affection to the will; consequently those who separate faith from the life merely think that a thing is so, and by so thinking, and on account of it, they say that they will be saved. And because they separate life from faith, they can be in no other than a natural affection, which is of the love of self and of the world; consequently they conjoin the affections of these loves to the things of their faith, which conjunction does not constitute the heavenly marriage which is heaven, but adultery which is hell, for it is the conjunction of truth with the affection of evil; and such adultery corresponds to the adultery of a son with a mother, as is evident from correspondences known in the spiritual world."

Such have no genuine truths, because all things of their faith are from the sense of the letter of the Word, and they do not consider that the truths that belong to that sense of the Word are appearances of truths, and that to accept and defend for truths themselves the appearances is to falsify the Word, according to what has been shown above (n. 715, 719, 720). This then is why “the dragon with his angels was cast out of heaven to the earth.” “Their place was not found anymore in heaven” signifies that in the heavens henceforth there is no place that corresponds to their state of life, for the reason that all places in the heavens correspond to the life of the angels, consequently “place” signifies a state of life, as has been said above (n. 731). And because the life of all the angels in the heavens is a life of the affection of good and truth, and those who are in faith alone (who are meant by “the dragon and his angels”) have no affection of good and truth, so there is no place in the heavens corresponding to the state of their life. Moreover, all the angels in the heavens are spiritual affections, and every one of them thinks from his own affection and according to it; from which it follows that those who place everything of the church and thence of heaven in thinking, and not in living, when they become spirits think from their affections, which are the affections of evil and falsity, as has been said above, and in consequence their faith, which they made to be of the thought alone and not of life, is exterminated and dissipated. In a word, no one can have any spiritual affection, which is an affection of good and truth, except from the life of faith, which is charity; charity itself is the affection of good, and faith is the affection of truth, and both joined together into one are the affection of good and truth."

But the matter is thus: “the dragon” does not mean those who have denied God and the Lord, and have rejected the Word, and made no account of the church and its doctrine, for those who are such and who do this are cast into hell immediately after death, and never appear in heaven, much less have any place there. “The dragon and his angels” mean those who acknowledge God and the Lord, and declare the Word to be holy, and also stand for the church and its doctrine, but only with the mouth and not with the heart.

Thence it can be seen that by the acknowledgment of God and the Lord, and by reading the Word and preaching it, they were exteriorly conjoined with heaven; but because their lives have not been at all in accord with anything of the Lord in the Word, interiorly they were conjoined with hell. Such are called “devil” and “satan,” because they have defiled the truths of the Word by a life of the love of self and the love of the world, and by evils that have gushed forth from those loves, like bubbling waters from their fountains, and because they have applied the literal sense of the Word to confirm such a life. Such persons, more than all others, are serpents, since they are more noxious than others; for they can draw over to their side the simple good, who are in the lowest heaven, especially by means of such things as they take from the sense of the letter of the Word and pervert. It is said that “they were seen in heaven,” and there “fought with Michael and his angels,” because the Word conjoined them with the heavens; for men are conjoined with the heavens by means of the Word; but when it was ascertained that they were in other than heavenly affections they were cast down out of heaven."

This, then, is what is signified by “the dragon with his angels was cast unto the earth,” and “their place was not found anymore in heaven.” 738. Verse 9. And that great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the devil and satan, that seduceth the whole world; he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him. 9. “And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent,” signifies that those who were in evils of life, and who had thence become sensual, and had perverted all things of the Word and thus of the church, were separated from heaven and were cast down into hell (n. 739); “called the devil and satan,” signifies because inwardly they are in evils and falsities that are from hell (n. 740); “that seduceth the whole world,” signifies that pervert all things of the church (n. 741); “he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him,” signifies that those evils and their falsities were condemned to hell (n. 742). 739a. Verse 9. And that great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, signifies that those who were in evils of life and who had thence become sensual, and had perverted all things of the Word and thus of the church, were separated from heaven and were cast down into hell. This is evident from the signification of “to be cast out,” as being, in reference to the dragon, to be separated from heaven and to be cast down into hell. That these had been conjoined to heaven but were afterwards separated may be seen in a preceding article (n. 737). That they were cast down and condemned to hell is meant by “he was cast out into the earth” (of which presently).

Also from the signification of “the old serpent,” as being those who are sensual, here that those who had perverted all things of the Word and of the church had thence become sensual. That “serpent” signifies the sensual may be seen above (n. 581, 715 at the end). The serpent is called “old,” because in olden times there were those who perverted all things of the Word and the church. According to the historical sense of the letter “the old serpent” means the serpent that seduced Eve and Adam in paradise, but both by that serpent and by this all such are meant as seduce the whole world, as can be seen from what follows in this paragraph. From this it is clear that “that great dragon was cast out, that old serpent,” signifies that those who were in evils of life, and who had perverted all things of the Word, and thus of the church, were separated from heaven and were cast down into hell. [2] That all who are in evils of life become sensual, and that those who thus become sensual pervert all things of the church, can be seen from this, that there are with men three degrees of life, an inmost, a middle, and an ultimate, and that these degrees with man are opened successively as he becomes wise. Every man at his birth is altogether sensual, so that even the five senses of his body must be opened by use; he next becomes sensual in thought, since he thinks from the objects that have entered through his bodily senses; afterwards he becomes more interiorly sensual; but so far as by visual experiences, by knowledges, and especially by the practices of moral life, he acquires for himself natural light, he becomes interiorly natural. This is the first or ultimate degree of man’s life. [3] And as at this time from parents, masters, and preachers, and from reading the Word and books thence, he imbibes knowledges of spiritual truth and good, and stores them up in his memory like other knowledges, he lays the foundations of the church with himself; and yet if he goes no further he continues natural.

For the spiritual man is in heaven and the natural in the world, and so far as heaven, that is, the Lord through heaven, can flow in through the spiritual man into the natural, so far evils and the falsities thence, which, as was said, have their seat in the natural man, are removed; for the Lord removes them, as he removes hell from heaven. The interior degree with man can be opened in no other way, because the evils and falsities that are in the natural man keep it closed up; for the spiritual degree, that is, the spiritual mind, contracts itself against evil and the falsity of evil of every kind as a fibril of the body does at the touch of a sharp point; for like as the fibers of the body contract themselves at every harsh touch, so does man’s interior mind, which is called the spiritual mind, at the touch or breath of evil or the falsity thence. But on the other hand, when things homogeneous, which are Divine truths from the Word that derive their essence from good, approach that mind, it opens itself; yet the opening is effected not otherwise than by the reception of the good of love flowing in through heaven from the Lord, and by its conjunction with the truths that man has stored up in his memory, and this conjunction is only effected by a life according to Divine truths in the Word, for when these truths come to be of the life they are called goods. Thence it may be clear how the second or middle degree is opened. [4] The third or inmost degree is opened with those who apply Divine truths at once to life, and do not reason about them from the memory, and thus bring them into doubt. This is called the celestial degree. As there are these three degrees of life with every man, which yet are opened in diverse ways, thence there are three heavens.

All these come into heaven. But those who have received Divine truths in the memory only, and not at the same time in the life, continue natural and even become sensual; and for the reason that the evils into which man is born have their seat, as was said above, in the natural and sensual man; and in such these evils have not been removed and as it were dispersed by the influx of good from the Lord and its reception by man; consequently with such the loves of the body rule, which in general are the love of self and the love of the world, and the consequent love and pride of self-intelligence. These loves, and the evils and their falsities that flow from them, fill the interiors of their natural mind, although these are covered without by things respectable and becoming which pertain to moral life, that are put on for the sake of the world and the laws enacted for the external man. Such although they may have filled their memory with knowledges from the Word, from the dogmas of their several religions and from the sciences, are yet natural and even sensual; for the interiors of their natural mind, which are nearest to the spiritual mind, are closed up by confirmations, even from the Word, against the spiritual life, which is a life according to Divine truths and is called charity towards the neighbor. These because they are sensual, are “the dragon,” and are called “serpents,” for “serpent” signifies the sensual, because the sensual is the lowest part of man’s life, and as it were creeps upon the ground and licks the dust like a serpent. 739b. [5] To illustrate this I will quote what is related in Genesis respecting “the old serpent” that seduced Eve and Adam, and will explain what it signifies in the spiritual sense: Out of the ground Jehovah God made to grow forth every tree that is desirable to the sight and good for food, and the tree of lives in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. And Jehovah God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden eating thou mayest eat, but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou mayest not eat, because in the day thou shalt eat of it"

And the woman said unto the serpent, Of the fruit of the tree of the garden we may eat, but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die. And the serpent said, Dying ye shall not die; for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened and ye shall be as God, knowing good and evil. And the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to give intelligence, and she took of the fruit thereof and did eat, and she gave also to her husband with her and he did eat. And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves girdles. And Jehovah said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, cursed art thou above every beast and above every wild beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life. And I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed; he shall trample on thy head,40 and thou shalt wound his heel.

For these historical narratives of the creation of heaven and earth, and of the garden in Eden, and of the posterity of Adam even to the flood, are composed historicals; and yet they are most holy, because every particular idea and every particular expression therein are correspondences, and thence signify spiritual things. Anyone of clear intelligence might discover this from the history of the creation in the first chapter, which began with light when the sun did not yet exist, and from various other things there; also from the creation of Eve the wife of Adam out of one of his ribs; also from the two trees in paradise, and from the prohibition to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, and yet, although they were the wisest of all they were seduced by the serpent and did eat; and that Jehovah should place such trees in the midst of the garden and suffer them to be seduced by the serpent to eat of the forbidden tree, which yet He might have averted; and"

Who cannot see that these things, with other like things which an obscure understanding might believe in simplicity, would be contrary to the Divine love and contrary to the Divine Providence and foresight? And yet there is no harm while children and the simple believe these things according to the historical letter, since they serve, as well as the rest of the Word, to conjoin human minds to angelic minds, for angels are in the spiritual sense when men are in the natural sense. But what is involved in these historicals in the spiritual sense shall be told in a few words. [6] The first chapter treats of the new creation or establishment of a church, which was the most ancient church on this globe, as well as the most excellent of all, for it was a celestial church, because it was in love to the Lord; and consequently the men of that church were most wise, having almost immediate communication with the angels of heaven, through whom they received wisdom from the Lord. Because they were in love to the Lord, and had revelations from heaven, and because they at once applied to life the Divine truths revealed to them, they were in a similar state as the angels of the third heaven; consequently that heaven consists chiefly of the men of that church. That church is meant by “Adam and his wife.” But “the garden in Eden” signifies their intelligence and wisdom, and this is also described by all that is told about that garden understood in the spiritual sense. Also how wisdom was lost in their posterity is described by “eating of the tree of knowledge.” For the two trees placed in the midst of the garden mean perception from the Lord and perception from the world; “the tree of lives” perception from the Lord, and “the tree of knowledge of good and evil” perception from the world, which yet in itself is mere cognition and knowledge. But “the serpent” that seduced them signifies the sensual of man, which communicates immediately with the world, therefore their seduction by the “serpent” means their seduction by the sensual, which derives all it has from the world and nothing from heaven."

So neither do they reason about truths whether they are so or not; for those who see truths in themselves do not reason, since reasoning implies a doubt whether a thing is true. For the same reason they never make mention of faith, for faith implies something unknown which must be believed although it is not seen. That the men of the most ancient church were such has been revealed to me from heaven, for it has been granted me to speak with them and to be informed, as can be seen from the various things related concerning the men of that church in Arcana Coelestia. [7] But it is to be known that they were never forbidden to acquire for themselves the knowledges of good and evil from heaven, for by these their intelligence and wisdom was perfected; neither were they forbidden to acquire for themselves the knowledges of good and evil from the world, for from this source their natural man had its knowledge. But they were forbidden to view these knowledges by a posterior way, because it was granted them to see all things that appeared before their eyes in the world by a prior way. To view the world and the things in it and to deduce knowledges from it by a prior way is to view them from the light of heaven, and to know in that way their quality. Therefore they were also able by knowledges from the world to confirm heavenly things, and thus to strengthen their wisdom. But they were forbidden to view knowledges from the world by a posterior way, which is done when conclusions are drawn from them respecting heavenly things, which is an inverted order that is called by the learned the order of physical or natural influx, and of this there is none in things heavenly.

The knowledges of good and evil from the Lord from which is wisdom, and the knowledges of good and evil from the world from which is science, were represented by “the tree of lives” and by “the tree of the knowledge of good and evil” in the midst of the garden. That they were permitted to appropriate to themselves knowledges from every source, not only from heaven but also from the world, provided they did not proceed in the inverted order, by reasoning about heavenly things from worldly knowledges, instead of thinking about worldly things from heavenly things, is signified by “Jehovah God commanded them to eat of every tree of the garden, but not of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil”; that if they did, heavenly wisdom and the church would perish with them is signified by “in the day that thou shalt eat of it dying thou shalt die,” “to eat” signifying in the spiritual sense to appropriate to oneself.

[10] As the sensual supposes that wisdom is acquired by means of knowledges from the world and by natural knowledges, and not by any influx out of heaven from the Lord, therefore from such ignorance and fallacy the serpent said to the woman, “Ye shall not die; for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and ye shall be as God, knowing good and evil”; for the sensual man believes that he knows all things, and that nothing is concealed from him; but not so the celestial man, who knows that he knows nothing from himself but only from the Lord, and that what he does know is so little as to be scarcely anything as compared with what he does not know. In fact, their posterity believed themselves to be gods, and that they knew all good and all evil; but from evil they were not capable of knowing heavenly good, but only worldly and corporeal good, and this in itself is not good; yet from heavenly good man is able to know what is evil. [11] That the affection of the natural man persuaded by its sensual supposed that intelligence in the things of heaven and the church may be acquired through knowledge of cognitions from the world is signified by “the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to give intelligence”; “woman” here signifying the affection of the natural man, which draws its desires from the sensual, and that affection is such. That that affection seduced also the rational is signified by “the woman took of the fruit of the tree and did eat, and gave to her husband with her and he did eat,” “the husband of the woman” signifying the rational.

For this reason it is said that “the seed of the woman shall crush its head, and that it shall hurt His heel”; “the seed of the woman” meaning the Lord; “the head of the serpent” all evil; and “the Lord’s heel” Divine truth in ultimates which with us is the sense of the letter of the Word; this the sensual man, or the sensual of man, perverts and falsifies and thus hurts.

They are such because they make the life to be of no account, saying that faith alone saves, and not any good of life. Therefore they are devils and satans, for man is such as he is interiorly, and not such as he is merely exteriorly, except when he speaks and acts outwardly from the interior. Moreover, a man continues such after death; for such as a man is interiorly, such he is in respect to the spirit, and the spirit of man is the affection from which is the will and the life therefrom. From this it follows that those who make no account of the life are interiorly devils and satans, and they also become devils and satans when their life in the world is ended and they become spirits. [2] They are called “the devil and satan” because both “the devil” and “satan” signify hell; “the devil” signifying the hell from which are evils, and “satan” the hell from which are falsities; this hell is called “satan” because all who are in it are called satans, and the other hell is called “the devil” because all who are in it are called devils. Before the creation of the world there was no devil or satan who had been an angel of light and was afterwards cast down with his crew into hell, as can be seen from what has been said in the work Heaven and Hell (n. 311–316, under the head, “Heaven and Hell Are from the Human Race”). [3] It is to be known that there are two kingdoms into which the heavens are divided, namely, a celestial kingdom and a spiritual kingdom (on which see in the work Heaven and Hell, n. 20–28). To these two kingdoms correspond by opposition the two kingdoms into which the hells are divided; to the celestial kingdom corresponds by opposition the infernal kingdom that consists of devils and is therefore called “the devil,” and to the spiritual kingdom corresponds by opposition the infernal kingdom that consists of satans and is therefore called “satan.” And as the celestial kingdom consists of angels who are in love to the Lord, so the infernal kingdom corresponding by opposition to the celestial"

[4] From this it is clear what “the devil” and “satan” signify in the following passages. In the Gospels: Jesus was led into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil (Matt. 4:1, seq.; Luke 4:1–13). What is signified by the “wilderness,” and by the Lord’s “temptations” for forty days and forty nights, has been shown above (n. 730e). He is said to have been tempted “by the devil” to signify that He was tempted by the hells from which are evils, thus by the worst of the hells, for these were the hells that chiefly fought against the Lord’s Divine love, since the love that reigned in those hells was the love of self, and this love is the opposite of the Lord’s love, thus of the love that is from the Lord. [5] In Matthew: The tares are the sons of the evil one; the enemy that soweth is the devil (Matt. 13:38, 39). “Tares” signify the falsities of doctrine, of religion, and of worship, which are from evil, therefore they are also called “the sons of the evil one”; and as evil brings them forth it is said that it is “the devil that soweth them.” [6] In Luke: Those upon the way are they that hear; then cometh the devil and taketh away the word from their heart, that they may not believe and be saved (Luke 8:12)."

This describes the Jewish nation, such as it had been from the beginning, namely, that it was in evil and in falsities therefrom. “Their father the devil” means evil from hell, in which their fathers were in Egypt and afterwards in the desert; that they willed to remain in the evils of their cupidities is signified by “the desires of your father ye will to do”; that they destroyed every truth of the understanding is signified by “he was a murderer from the beginning, and stood not in the truth because there was no truth in him”; as “man” signifies the truth of intelligence, so “murderer” signifies its destroyer. Their falsities from evil are signified by “when he speaketh a lie he speaketh from his own”; “his own” signifying the evil of the will, and “lie” the falsity therefrom. [10] In Matthew: The Pharisees said of Jesus, He doth not cast out demons but by Beelzebub the prince of the demons. Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said unto them, If satan casteth out satan he is divided against himself; how then shall his kingdom stand? But if I in the spirit of God cast out demons, then is the kingdom of God come unto you (Matt. 12:24–26, 28)."

      "text": "APOCALYPSE EXPLAINED 2636 Here the term “satan,” and not devil is used, because “Beelzebub,” who was the god of Ekron, means the god of all falsities, for “Beelzebub” by derivation means the god of flies, and “flies” signify the falsities of the sensual man, thus falsities of every kind. This is why Beelzebub is called satan. So, too, the Lord said, “If I in the spirit of God cast out demons, then is the kingdom of God come unto you”; “the spirit of God” meaning Divine truth proceeding from the Lord, and “the kingdom of God” thence signifying heaven and the church that are in Divine truths. [11] In the Gospels: Peter rebuking Jesus because he was willing to suffer, Jesus turned and said unto Peter, Get thee behind me, satan, thou art a stumbling block, because thou savorest not the things which are of God, but the things which are of men (Matt. 16:22, 23; Mark 8:32, 33). The Lord said this to Peter because in a representative sense “Peter” signified faith; and as faith is of truth, and also, as here, of falsity, Peter is called satan, for as has been said “satan” means the hell that is the source of falsities. “Peter” represented faith in both senses, namely, faith from charity, and faith without charity; and faith without charity is the faith of falsity. Moreover, those who are in faith without charity find a stumbling block in the Lord’s suffering Himself to be crucified; therefore this is called a “stumbling block.” As the passion of the cross was the Lord’s last temptation and complete victory over all the hells, and also the complete union of His Divine with the Divine Human, and this is unknown to those who are in the faith of falsity, the Lord said “thou savorest not the things which are of God, but the things which are of men.” [12] In Luke: Jesus said to Simon, Behold satan demanded you that he might sift you as wheat. But I prayed for thee that thy faith fail not; when, therefore, thou shalt be converted, strengthen thou thy brethren (Luke 22:31, 32)."

      "text": "APOCALYPSE EXPLAINED 2637 Here, too, “Peter” represents faith without charity, which faith is the faith of falsity, for this was said to him by the Lord just before he thrice denied Him. Because he represented faith therefore the Lord says, “I prayed for thee that thy faith fail not”; that he represented the faith of falsity is evident from the Lord’s saying to him, “when, therefore, thou shalt be converted, strengthen thou thy brethren.” As the faith of falsity is like chaff before the wind, it is said that “satan demanded them that he might sift them as wheat,” “wheat” meaning the good of charity separated from chaff. From this it is clear why the name “satan” is here used. [13] In the same: I beheld satan as lightning falling from heaven (Luke 10:18). Here “satan” has a similar signification as “the dragon” who was also seen in heaven and was cast out of heaven; but properly it is the “dragon” that is meant by the “devil,” and “his angels” that are meant by “satan.” That “the angels of the dragon” mean the falsities of evil will be seen in a subsequent paragraph. “Satan falling down from heaven” signifies that the Lord by Divine truth, which He then was, thrust all falsities out of heaven and subjugated those hells that are called “satan,” like as Michael cast down “the dragon and his angels” (of which above, n. 737). 740c. [14] In Job: There was a day when the sons of God came to stand by Jehovah, and satan came in the midst of them. And Jehovah said unto satan, Whence comest thou? And satan answered Jehovah and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking through it. And Jehovah gave into the hand of satan all things belonging to Job, but he was not to put forth his hand upon Job; also afterwards that he might touch his bone and his flesh (Job 1:6–12; 2:1–7). That this is a composed history is evident from many things in this book. The book of Job is a book of the ancient church, full of correspondences, according to the mode of writing at that time,"

The angels at that time were called “sons of God,” because “sons of God,” the same as “angels,” mean Divine truths, and “satan” infernal falsities. And as the hells tempt men by falsities, as Job was afterwards tempted, and as infernal falsities are dispersed by Divine truths, it is said that “satan stood in the midst of the sons of God.” What the rest signifies will not be explained here, since it must be made clear in its series. [15] In David: They put upon me evil for good, and hatred for my love; appoint Thou a wicked one over him, and let satan stand at his right hand (Ps. 109:5–6). This, like most things in the Psalms of David, is a prophecy respecting the Lord and His temptations; for He above all others endured the most frightful temptations; and as He in His temptations fought from Divine love against the hells, which were most hostile to Him, it is said “they put upon me evil for good, and hatred for my love”; and as infernal evil and falsity prevail with them it is said “appoint thou a wicked one over him, and let satan stand at his right hand”; “to stand at the right hand” signifying to be wholly possessed, and “satan” signifying infernal falsity with which he was possessed. [16] In Zechariah: Afterwards he showed me Joshua the great priest standing before the angel of Jehovah, and satan standing at his right hand to be his adversary; and Jehovah said unto satan, Jehovah rebuke thee, even He who chooseth Jerusalem; is not this a brand delivered out of the fire? And Joshua was clothed in filthy garments, and thus stood before the angel (Zech 3:1–3). What this involves can be seen only from the series of things that precede and follow; from these it can be seen that this represented how the Word was falsified. “Joshua the great priest” signifies here the law or the Word; and “he stood before the angel clothed in filthy garments” signifies its falsification. This shows that “satan”"

Because it is the sense of the letter of the Word only that can be falsified, for the reason that the things in that sense are truths in appearance only, and those who interpret the Word according to the letter cannot easily be convinced of falsities, so Joshua43 said, “Jehovah rebuke thee,” as above (n. 735), where is explained what is signified by “Michael disputed with the devil about the body of Moses, and Michael said to the devil, The Lord rebuke thee” (Jude, verse 9). Because the truth of doctrine from the Word which has been falsified is here meant, it is said, “Jehovah who chooseth Jerusalem; is not this a brand delivered out of the fire?” “Jerusalem” signifying the doctrine of the church, and “a brand delivered out of the fire” that there was but little of truth left. [17] In these passages in the Old Testament “satan” only is mentioned, and in no place the devil, but instead of the devil the terms “foe,” “enemy,” “hater,” “adversary,” “accuser,” “demon,” also “death” and “hell,” are made use of. From this it may be clear that “the devil” signifies the hell from which are evils, and “satan” the hell from which are falsities; as also in the following passages in Revelation: Afterwards I saw an angel coming down out of heaven having the key of the abyss and a great chain upon his hand, and he laid hold on the dragon, the old serpent, which is the devil and satan, and bound him a thousand years. And when the thousand years are finished, satan shall be loosed out of his prison, and shall lead the nations astray. And the devil that led them astray was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone (Rev. 20:1, 2, 7, 8, 10). But what “demon” and “spirit of a demon” signify may be seen above (n. 586). 741a.

Thereby all things of the Word and thence all things of the church are falsified, for the Lord says that the law and the prophets44 hang on these two commandments, “To love God above all things, and the neighbor as thyself.” These two commandments signify to live and act according to the commandments of the Word; for to love is to will and to do, since what a man interiorly loves, that he wills, and what he wills that he does. “The law and the prophets” signify all things of the Word. [2] There are two principles of evil and falsity into which the church successively falls. One is dominion over all things of the church and of heaven, which dominion is meant in the Word by “Babel” or “Babylonia”; into this the church falls by reason of evil; the other is the separation of faith from charity, in consequence of which separation all the good of life perishes; this is meant in the Word by “Philistia,” and is signified by “the he-goat” in Daniel, and by “the dragon” in Revelation; into this the church falls by reason of falsity. But since this chapter treats of “the dragon,” which especially signifies the religion of faith separate from charity, I will mention in passing some things whereby the defenders of faith separate seduce the world. They especially seduce by teaching that as from oneself no one can do good that is in itself good, or can do good without placing merit in it, so good works can contribute nothing to salvation; nevertheless, goods should be done on account of use for the public good; and these are the goods that are meant in the Word and thence in preachings, and in some of the prayers of the church. How great an error this is shall now be told. When a man does good from the Word, that is, because it is commanded by the Lord in the Word, he does it not from himself but from the Lord, for the Lord is the Word (John 1:1, 14), and the Lord is in those things that man has from the Word, as He teaches in these words in John:"

This is why the Lord so often commands that His words and commandments must be done; and that those who do them shall have eternal life; so also that everyone will be judged according to his works. From this it then follows that those who do good from the Word do good from the Lord, and good from the Lord is truly good, and so far as it is from the Lord there is no merit in it. [3] That good from the Word, thus from the Lord, is truly good, is evident also from these words in Revelation: I stand at the door and knock; if anyone hear My voice and open the door, I will come in to him and will sup with him and he with Me (Rev. 3:20). This shows that the Lord is always and continually present and bestows the effort to do good, but that man must open the door, that is, must receive the Lord; and he receives Him when he does good from His Word. Although this appears to man to be done as of himself, yet it is not of man but of the Lord in him. It so appears to man because he has no other feeling than that he thinks from himself and acts from himself; and yet when he thinks and acts from the Word he does it as if of himself, therefore he then also believes that he does it of the Lord. [4] From this it can be seen that the good that a man does from the Word is spiritual good, and that this conjoins man to the Lord and to heaven. But the good that a man does for the world’s sake and for the sake of the communities in the world, which is called civil and moral good, conjoins him to the world and not to heaven. Moreover, the conjunction of the truth of faith is with spiritual good, which is the good of charity towards the neighbor, because faith in itself is spiritual, and what is spiritual cannot be conjoined with any other good than what is equally spiritual. But civil and moral good, separate from spiritual good, is not good in itself, because it is from man; yea, so far as self and the world lie"

[5] “To seduce the whole world” signifies to pervert all things of the church, because “the world” signifies in general the church as to all things of it, both goods and truths; but in particular it signifies the church in respect to good; this is the signification of “world” when “the earth” also is mentioned. That “the earth” in the Word signifies the church has been shown above (n. 304, 697); but when “the world” is also mentioned “the earth” signifies the church in respect to truth. For there are two things that constitute the church, namely, truth and good, and these two are signified by “earth” and “world” in the following passages. [6] In Isaiah: With my soul have I desired Thee in the night; yea, with my spirit in the midst of me have I early waited for Thee; for when Thou teachest the earth Thy judgments, the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness (Isa. 26:9). “Night” signifies a state in which there is no light of truth, and “morning” a state in which there is the light of truth; the latter state is from love, but the former is when there is as yet no love. So “the soul that desired Jehovah in the night” signifies a life that is not yet in the light of truth; and “the spirit in the midst of him with which he waited for Jehovah in the morning” signifies a life that is in the light of truth; so it is added, “for when Thou teachest the earth Thy judgments, the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness,” which signifies that the church is in truths from the Lord, and by means of truths is in good; “earth” signifying the church in respect to truths, and “world,” the church in respect to good; for “judgment” in the Word is predicated of truth, and “righteousness” of good, and “inhabitants” signify the men of the church who are in the goods of doctrine and thence of life. (That “judgment” in the Word is predicated of truth, and “righteousness” of good, may be seen in Arcana Coelestia, n. 2235, 9857; and that “to inhabit” signifies to live, and thence “inhabitants” those who are in the good of doctrine and thus of life, may be seen above, n. 133, 479, 662.)"

[22] In David: The channels of waters appeared and the foundations of the world were revealed at Thy rebuke, O Jehovah, at the breath of the spirit of Thy nostrils (Ps. 18:15; 2 Sam. 22:16). That all things of the church in respect to its truths and goods were overturned from the foundation is signified by “the channels of waters appeared and the foundations of the world were revealed”; “the channels of waters” meaning the truths, and “the foundations of the world” its goods, and “to appear” and “to be revealed” meaning to be overturned from the foundation. That this destruction is from the hatred and fury of the evil against Divine things is signified by “at Thy rebuke, O Jehovah, at the breath of the spirit of Thy nostrils”; the “rebuke” and “the spirit of Jehovah’s nostrils” have a similar signification as “His anger and wrath” mentioned elsewhere in the Word. But since the Lord has no anger or wrath against the evil, while the evil have against the Lord, and as anger and wrath appear to the evil when they perish to be from the Lord, therefore this is so said according to that appearance. “The breath of the spirit of Jehovah’s nostrils” means also the east wind, which destroys by drought, and overturns by its penetrating power.

[25] In Job: They shall thrust him away from light unto darkness, and chase him out of the world (Job 18:18). Because “light” signifies the truth, and the “world” the good of the church, and when the wicked man casts himself from truth into falsity he also casts himself from good into evil, it is said “they shall thrust him away from light into darkness, and chase him out of the world,” “darkness” meaning falsities, and “to chase out of the world” meaning to cast out from the good of the church.

This is said of the consummation of the age, which is the last time of the church, when there is no longer any truth because there is no good; the state of heaven at that time is described by these words, that “men will faint for fear and for expectation of the things coming upon the whole world”; this describes the fear of those who are in the heavens, that everything of the church in respect to its good and therefore in respect to its truths would perish, and the expectation of help from the Lord. That the power of Divine truth is weakened is signified by “the shaking of the powers of the heavens”; “the powers of the heavens” meaning Divine truths in respect to power; that the Lord will then make evident Divine truth, which has power and from which is intelligence, is signified by “then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud of the heavens, with power and much glory.” [27] “The earth and the world” have a like signification in the following passage in Revelation: They are the spirits of demons doing signs to go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them together unto the war (Rev. 16:14). It is said “unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world,” because one thing of the church is signified by “earth,” and another by “world.” As the “world” signifies the church in respect to good it also signifies all things of the church, for good is the essential of the church; therefore where there is good there is also truth, for every good desires truth and wishes to be conjoined to truth and to be spiritually nourished by it, thus also reciprocally. 742.

[2] “To be cast out into the earth” means to be condemned to hell, because this is signified by the expression “to be cast out of heaven.” In the spiritual world there are lands as in the natural world, full of mountains and hills, likewise of valleys and rivers; when these taken together are called the earth, then the “earth” signifies the church; but when the lowest parts of the earth are meant, as is meant in the expression “to be cast out of heaven into the earth,” then the “earth” signifies what is condemned, because under those lowest parts are the hells, and in the hells also there are lands, but such as are condemned. For this reason no angel goes about ordinarily with his head bent forward or bowed down or looking to the earth, still less lying upon it in its lowest parts, or taking up any of its dust. From this it comes that those who condemned others to hell in the world are wont to take the dust of that earth and to cast it upon another, because this corresponds to such condemnation. Furthermore, no one is permitted to walk with naked feet upon those lands. The earths (or lands) there that are condemned are easily distinguished from those that are not condemned, because the condemned land is utterly barren and mere dust, and is here and there covered with thorns and briars, while the land not condemned is fertile and full of herbs, shrubs, trees, and also fields.

Verse 10. And I heard a great voice in heaven saying, signifies the joy of the angels of heaven because of the light and wisdom then with them. This is evident from the signification of “a great voice saying,” as being the attestation of joy from the heart (of which presently); also from the signification of “in heaven,” as being with the angels of heaven. That this is because of the light and wisdom then with them, follows for the reason that when the “dragons” (by whom are meant those who have some knowledge of the cognitions of truth and good from the Word, and yet are not in truths and goods because they are not in a life from truths and goods) had been cast out, and thus were no longer in conjunction with heaven, then the angels came into light and wisdom, and from this was their joy. The angels then came into light and wisdom because there is a connection of all in the heavens, from the first there to the last, that is, from those who are in the inmost or third heaven, who are first, to those who are in the lowest or first heaven, who are last; for the Lord flows in through the third heaven into the lowest, and by influx conjoins the heavens. Because of this the whole heaven is in the sight of the Lord as one Man. When, therefore, the ultimates of the heavens have connection with those who are conjoined to hell, thus with those who are signified by “the dragon and his angels,” then in the degree in which the lowest heaven is conjoined with such, the light and intelligence of the angels of heaven are lessened."

This shows that the health of the body depends upon the condition of the extreme parts as a house does upon its foundation. This comparison especially applies to men worn out with age, whose extreme parts first become hardened, and thus they lose the faculty to act and feel, and by degrees this extends to the interiors, which causes death. The same reasoning applies to the heavens, which are as one Man in the sight of the Lord, when the outermost parts become callous as it were, which takes place when those parts have conjunction with the hells. Thus it was with the heavens so long as “the dragons” were seen there, for “the dragons,” as has been said, had conjunction with the ultimates of heaven as to externals, but with the hells as to their internals. This is why it was said that “the dragon was seen in heaven,” and that there was a combat between him and Michael in heaven, and finally that “he was cast out of heaven,” which signifies that he was separated. From this it is that “the great voice heard in heaven” signifies the attestation of joy from the heart with the angels of heaven. That they had this joy because of the light and wisdom they then had follows from what has been said before, namely, that as a man is in his active and sensitive life from the interiors when his extreme parts are in their integrity, so too are the lower and the higher heavens in their intelligence and wisdom, and in the consequent joy of their heart; therefore the same words mean that the angels had joy from the light and wisdom they then had. 745.

From this it is clear that “Now is come the salvation, and the power, and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of His Christ,” signifies that now the Lord has power by His Divine truth to save those who are of His church who receive Divine truth with heart and soul. [2] It is said “who receive with heart and soul,” meaning with love and faith, likewise with the will and understanding; for in the Word when “soul and heart” are both mentioned “soul” signifies faith, likewise understanding, and “heart” signifies love, likewise will; for soul [anima] means there in the ultimate sense the respiration of man, which is also called his “spirit” [or breath], and the verb animare means to respire; also when a man dies he is said “to give up the ghost” [emittere animam et spirituum]. Moreover, it is also from correspondence that “soul” signifies faith, also the understanding, and that “heart” signifies love, as also the will; for faith and understanding correspond to the breathing [animatio] or respiration of the lungs, and the love and will correspond to the motion and pulsation of the heart (on which correspondence see above, n. 167; and Arcana Coelestia, n. 2930, 3883–3896, 9050).

[4] This is also meant by these words in John: His own received Him not; but as many as received Him, to them gave He power to become sons of God, to them that believe on His name; who were born not of bloods nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God (John 1:11–13). “His own” who received Him not mean those who are of the church where the Word is, and to whom the Lord could be known through the Word; therefore those who were of the Jewish church are here meant by “His own.” That the Lord would “give to those that believe on His name power to become sons of God” signifies that He gives heaven to those47 who receive Divine truths from Him in soul and heart, or in faith and life; “to believe on His name” meaning to receive the Lord in faith and life, for “the name of the Lord” signifies everything by which He is worshiped; “sons of God” mean those who are regenerated by the Lord; “who are born not of bloods” signifies who have not falsified and adulterated the Word; “nor of the will of the flesh” signifies who are not in evils from what is their own ; “nor of the will of man” signifies who are not in falsities from what is their own , for the “will” signifies what is man’s own , “flesh” signifies evil, and “man” signifies falsity; “but born of God” signifies those who have been regenerated by truths from the Word and by a life according to them. From this it can be seen that those who are not willing to be reformed and regenerated by the Lord, which is effected by the reception of Divine truth in faith and life, cannot be saved."

For the accuser of our brethren is cast down, signifies when those have been separated from heaven and condemned to hell who have assaulted the life of faith, which is charity. This is evident from the signification of “cast down,” as being, in reference to the dragon, that those who are meant by “the dragon” have been separated from heaven and condemned to hell (of which above, n. 739a, 742); also from the signification of “the accuser of our brethren,” as being those who have assaulted the life of faith, which is charity, for an “accuser” signifies one who attacks, denounces, and reproaches, for he that accuses also attacks, denounces, and reproaches. Moreover, the same term in the original tongue means an adversary and one who reproaches; and what is wonderful, those who are “dragons,” although they make no account of the life, yet in the spiritual world they accuse the faithful if they observe any evil of ignorance, for they inquire into their life for the purpose of arraigning and condemning, and thence they are called accusers. [2] But “the brethren” whom they accuse mean all who are in the heavens as well as all on the earth who are in the good of charity; such are called “brethren” because they all have one Father, namely, the Lord, and those who are in the good of love to the Lord and in the good of charity towards the neighbor are His sons, and are called “sons of God,” “sons of the kingdom,” and “heirs.” It follows, therefore, that as they are the sons of one Father they are brethren. Moreover, it is the primary commandment of the Lord, the Father, that they should mutually love one another, consequently it is love from which they are brethren; and love also is spiritual conjunction. From this it came that with the ancient people in the churches in which charity was the essential, all were called brethren, so likewise in our Christian church at its beginning. This is why “brother” in the spiritual sense signifies charity. That formerly all who were of one church called themselves brethren and that the Lord calls those brethren who are in love to Him and in charity towards the neighbor, can be seen from many passages in the Word. But in order that what is signified by “brother” may be distinctly perceived it shall be illustrated from the Word."

From this it can be seen that all the sons of Israel were called brethren among themselves; the primary reason of their being so called was that they were all descendants of Jacob, who was their common father; but the remote reason was that “brother” signifies the good of charity, and as this good is the essential of the church, all are also spiritually conjoined by it. Another reason is that “Israel” in the highest sense signifies the Lord, and thence “the sons of Israel” signify the church. 746c.

In Isaiah: The land has been darkened, and the people have become as food of the fire; they shall not spare a man his brother; they shall eat every man the flesh of his own arm, Manasseh Ephraim, and Ephraim Manasseh (Isa. 9:19–21). “Man and brother” signify truth and good, and in the contrary sense falsity and evil, therefore it is said “Manasseh shall eat Ephraim, and Ephraim Manasseh,” for “Manasseh” signifies voluntary good, and “Ephraim” intellectual truth, both of the external church, and in the contrary sense evil and falsity.

This is because all in the heavens are recipients of the Divine that proceeds from Him; and the Divine that proceeds from the Lord, of which they are recipients, is the Lord in heaven and also in the church; and this is not of angel or man, but is of the Lord with them; consequently the good of charity itself with them, which is the Lord’s, He calls brother, in like manner also angels and men, because they are the recipient subjects of that good. In a word, the Divine pro ceeding, which is the Divine of the Lord in the heavens, is the Divine born of the Lord in heaven; from that Divine, therefore, angels who are recipients of it are called “sons of God,” and as these are brethren because of that Divine received in themselves, it is the Lord in them who says “brother,” for when angels speak from the good of charity they speak not from themselves but from the Lord. This, then, is why the Lord says, “Inasmuch as ye did it unto one of the least of these My brethren ye did it unto Me.” So in the spiritual sense the brethren of the Lord are the goods of charity that are enumerated in the verses preceding, and these are called by the Lord “brethren” for the reason just given. Moreover, “the King,” who so calls them, signifies the Divine proceeding, which in one word is called Divine truth or the Divine spiritual, which in its essence is the good of charity. [10] It is therefore to be kept in mind that the Lord did not call them “brethren” because He was a man like them, according to an opinion that is received in the Christian world; and for this reason it is not allowable for any man to call the Lord “brother,” for He is God even in respect to the Human, and God is not a brother, but the Father. In the churches on the earth the Lord is called brother, because the idea of His Human which they have formed is the same as their idea of any other man’s human, when yet the Lord’s Human is Divine."

So in David: I will declare Thy name to my brethren; in the midst of the congregation will I praise Thee (Ps. 22:22). I am become a stranger to my brethren, and an alien to my mother’s sons (Ps. 69:8). For the sake of my brethren and companions I will speak, Peace be in thee (Ps. 122:8). This was said by David as if respecting himself, and yet in the representative spiritual sense David here means the Lord. In Moses: Out of the midst of thy brethren shalt thou set a king over them;52 thou mayest not put a man that is an alien over them, who is not thy brother; but let him not exalt his heart above his brethren (Deut. 17:15, 20). The “brethren” from whom a king might be set over them signify all who are of the church, for it is said, “Thou mayest not put over them a man that is an alien”; “a man that is an alien” and a “stranger” signifying one who is not of the church. [12] In the same: Jehovah thy God will raise up unto thee a prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren like unto me; unto him shall ye hearken (Deut. 18:15, 18). This is a prophecy respecting the Lord, who is meant by “the prophet” that Jehovah God will raise up of the brethren. They are called “thy brethren,” that is, of Moses, because “Moses” means in a representative sense the Lord in relation to the Word, and a “prophet” means one who teaches the Word; thus also the Word"

[13] (4) That all those are called “brethren” by the Lord who acknowledge Him and are in the good of charity from Him, follows from this, that the Lord is the Father of all and the Teacher of all, and from Him as Father is every good of charity, and from Him as Teacher is every truth of that good. Therefore the Lord says in Matthew: Be ye not called teacher, for one is your Teacher, Christ; but all ye are brethren. And call no man your father upon earth, for one is your Father who is in the heavens (Matt. 23:8, 9). From this it is clearly evident that the words of the Lord must be understood spiritually; for who that is a teacher may not be called teacher? Or who that is a father may not be called father? But as “father” signifies good, and “the Father in the heavens” Divine good, and as “teacher” or “rabbi” signifies truth, and “the Teacher, Christ,” Divine truth, so on account of the spiritual sense in all things of the Word it is said, “Call no man your father upon earth, nor anyone teacher,” that is, in the spiritual sense, not in the natural sense. In the natural sense men may be called teachers and fathers, but representatively; that is to say, teachers in the world teach truths indeed, but from the Lord, not from themselves, and fathers in the world are good, and lead their children to good, but from the Lord, not from themselves. From this it follows that although they are called teachers and fathers still they are not teachers and fathers, but the Lord alone is Teacher and Father. “To call” and “to call by a name” signifies in the Word to recognize the quality of anyone. Because all in heaven and in the church are disciples and sons of the Lord, who is their Teacher and their Father, the Lord says, “all ye are brethren”; for the Lord calls all in heaven and in the church “sons and heirs” from their consociation by love from Him, and thus by mutual love, which is charity; therefore it is from the Lord that they are brethren.

[14] From this also it is clear whom the Lord means by “brethren,” namely, all who acknowledge Him and are in the good of charity from Him, consequently who are of His church. Such are meant by the Lord by “brethren” in the following passages. In Luke: Jesus said to Peter, When thou shalt be converted strengthen thy brethren (Luke 22:32). The term “brethren” here does not mean the Jews, but it means all who acknowledge the Lord and are in good from charity and faith, thus all who were to receive the gospel through Peter, both Jews and Gentiles, for “Peter” in the Word of the Gospels means truth from good, thus also faith from charity; but here “Peter” means faith separated from charity, for just before it is said of him: Simon, behold satan demanded you that he might sift you as wheat. But I prayed for you that your faith fail not (Luke 22:31–32); and afterwards it is said to him: I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day until thou hast thrice denied that thou knowest Me (Luke 22:34). Such is faith without charity. But “Peter converted” signifies truth from good, which is from the Lord, or faith from charity, which is from the Lord; therefore it is said, “When thou shalt have been converted strengthen thy brethren.” [15] In Matthew: Peter said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me and I should forgive him? (Matt. 18:2) So also shall My heavenly Father do to you if ye from your hearts forgive not everyone his brother their trespasses (Matt. 18:35)."

[16] In the same: Why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother’s eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye? Or how wilt thou say unto thy brother, Let me cast out the mote out of thine eye, when yet there is a beam in thine own eye? Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thine own eye, and then thou shalt see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother’s eye (Matt. 7:3–5). Here too, because this treats of charity the term “brother” is used, for “to cast out the mote out of a brother’s eye” signifies to instruct respecting falsity and evil, and to reform. It is said by the Lord, “a mote out of the brother’s eye,” and “a beam out of one’s own eye,” because of the spiritual sense in every particular of what the Lord said; for without that sense, of what consequence would it be to see a mote in the eye of another and not consider a beam in one’s own eye, or to cast a beam out of one’s own eye before he casts a mote out of another’s eye? A “mote” signifies a slight falsity of evil, and a “beam” a great falsity of evil, and the “eye” signifies the understanding and also faith. “Mote” and “beam” signify the falsity of evil, because “wood” signifies good; and thus a “beam” signifies the truth of good, and in the contrary sense the falsity of evil, and the “eye” signifies the understanding and faith. This shows what is signified by “seeing the mote and the beam,” and by “casting them out of the eye.” (That “wood” signifies good, and in the contrary sense evil, may be seen in Arcana Coelestia, n. 643, 3720, 4943, 8354, 8740; and that the “eye” signifies the understanding, and also faith, n. 2701, 4403–4421, 4523–4534, 9051, 10569; also above, n. 37, 152.)

This whole chapter treats of the interior life of man, which is the life of his soul, consequently of his will and thought therefrom; thus it treats of the life of charity, which is the spiritual moral life. This life the sons of Jacob knew nothing about before, because from their fathers down they were external men. For this reason also they were kept in the observance of external worship, according to statutes that were external, representing the internal things of worship and of the church. But in this chapter the Lord teaches that the interior things of the church must not only be represented by external acts, but must also be loved and done from the soul and heart; therefore “whosoever doeth and teacheth, he shall be called great in the kingdom of the heavens,” signifies that he will be saved who from interior life does and teaches the external things of the church. “Except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees ye shall not enter into the kingdom of the heavens,” signifies that unless the life is internal, and from that is external, heaven is not in man and man is not received into heaven; “righteousness” signifies the good of life from the good of charity, and “to exceed that of the scribes and Pharisees” signifies that the life must be internal, and not external"

External life from the internal is taught in the commandment of the Decalog, “Thou shalt not kill”; but they did not know that wishing to kill a man is killing him; therefore it is first said, “Ye have heard that it was said to them of old time, Thou shalt not kill, and whosoever shall kill shall be liable to the judgment”; for the doctrine had prevailed with the Jews from ancient time, that it was admissible to kill those who injured them, especially the Gentiles, and that they were to be punished for this lightly or grievously according to the circumstances of the hostility, consequently in reference to the body only and not as to the soul; this is meant by “he shall be liable to the judgment.” [18] That one who thinks ill of his neighbor without adequate cause, and turns himself away from the good of charity, will be punished lightly as to his soul, is signified by “Whosoever is angry with his brother without cause shall be liable to the judgment”; “to be angry,” signifies to think ill, for it is distinguished from “saying Raca,” and “saying, Thou fool.” “Brother” means the neighbor, and also the good of charity, and “to be liable to the judgment” means to be examined and to be punished according to circumstances. That one who from wrong thought slanders the neighbor, and thus despises the good of charity as of little value, will be punished grievously, is signified by “whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be liable to the council,” for “to say Raca” signifies to slander the neighbor from evil thought, thus to hold the good of charity to be of little value, for “to say Raca” means to hold as useless and as of little value, and “brother” means the good of charity. That one who hates the neighbor, that is, one who is altogether averse to the good of charity, is condemned to hell, is signified by “whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be liable to the hell of fire,” to say “Thou fool” meaning to be altogether averse to, “brother” meaning the good of charity, and “the hell of fire” the hell where those are who hate that good and thence the neighbor.

The three degrees of punishment are signified by “the judgment,” “the council,” and “the hell of fire”; the punishments for lighter evils are signified by “the judgment,” the punishments for the more grievous evils, by “the council,” and the punishments for the most grievous evils, by “the hell of fire.” [19] As the universal heaven is in the good of charity towards the neighbor, and the universal hell is in anger, enmity, and hatred against the neighbor, and hence these are the opposites of that good; and as worship of the Lord because it is internal is worship from heaven, but it is no worship if anything of it is from hell, and yet external worship without internal is from hell, therefore it is said, “If thou offer thy gift upon the altar, and shalt there remember that thy brother hath aught against thee, go, first be reconciled to thy brother, and then coming offer thy gift upon the altar”; “the gift upon the altar” signifying the worship of the Lord from love and charity, “brother” meaning the neighbor, and in an abstract sense the good of charity; “having aught against thee” signifying anger, enmity, or hatred, and “to be reconciled” the dispersion of these and the consequent conjunction by love. [20] From this it can be seen that the Lord means by “brother” the like as by “neighbor,” and “neighbor” signifies in the spiritual sense good in the whole complex, and good in the whole complex is the good of charity. “Brother” has a similar meaning in the spiritual sense in many passages in the Old Testament.

This is why it is said in John: In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and God was the Word (John 1:1). They dispute in favor of faith separated from a life of charity, because they confirm their heresy from certain passages in the Word understood according to the mere letter, and when they have thus confirmed it they believe it to be the very truth of the church, although it is a falsity.

The Divine truth proceeding from the Lord’s Divine Human is what is called “the Holy Spirit.” That this proceeds from the glorified Human of the Lord, He Himself teaches in John: The Holy Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified (John 7:39). The Human glorified is the Divine Human. (But on this more may be seen in the New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine, n. 280–310; also in Heaven and Hell, from beginning to end.

Those who are in this acknowledgment are also in the acknowledgment that the Lord’s Human is Divine, for the Divine itself cannot dwell elsewhere than in what is Divine from itself. But because the scholars amongst us cannot easily comprehend this, they separate in their thought the Divine from the Human of the Lord, and place the Divine without or above it; nevertheless, this is contrary to the Christian doctrine of the Trinity, which is called the Athanasian or Nicene Confession, which is that the Divine took to itself the Human, and that they are not two but a united Person, just the same as soul and body. 750a.

Think if you can whether there can be any ratio between a hundred thousand years and eternity, and you will find there is none. These with many other thoughts flow in from heaven with those who endure spiritual temptations, therefore “they love not their soul [that is, their life in the world], even unto death.” [2] What is meant by “soul” is but little known in the world, because scholars have put forth several theories about the seat of the soul in the body, as also about its essence, and its influx into and"

From this it has come to be believed that the soul is a cogitative something, in its essence ethereal, and when separated from the body has no organs of motion or sense as it had in the world, until it is again conjoined with the body, which they say will take place at the time of the last judgment. As so unsuitable an idea of the soul of man has been accepted in the learned world it is important to illustrate from the Word what is meant by the soul. In general, the soul means the man, and in particular the life of man; and as there are in every man three degrees of life, there are also as many degrees of the soul. But as the whole life of man resides in his two faculties that are called will and understanding, on which account these are sometimes in the Word called “lives,” in the plural, and as the soul means the life, it follows that there is a soul of the will and a soul of the understanding, and that the soul of the will is affection, which is of love, and the soul of the understanding is thought therefrom. But in the Word, the “soul” means properly the life of man’s understanding, which is thought, and the “heart” the life of the will, which is affection. And as the respiration of the lungs corresponds to the life of the understanding, which is thought, and the pulsation of the heart corresponds to the life of the will which is affection, so in the lowest natural sense the life of respiration is meant by “soul”; consequently the dying are said to give up the soul or spirit, also that they have no more animation, or that no breath from the mouth is perceived. That such is the meaning of “soul” in the Word can be seen from passages where it is mentioned. 750b. [3] (1) That in general “soul” signifies man is evident from the following passages. In Moses: Abram took every soul that they had gotten in Haran; and they departed into the land of Canaan (Gen. 12:5). The king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the souls, and take the substance to thyself (Gen. 14:21). All the souls of the sons and daughters from Leah were thirty and three (Gen. 46:15)."

The soul that is not circumcised shall be cut off from his people (Gen. 17:14); and elsewhere. In these passages “soul” is used in place of man. 750c. [4] (2) That in particular “soul” signifies the life of the body is evident from these passages. In Luke: The rich man thought with himself, I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast many goods laid up for many years; rest, eat, drink and be merry. But God said unto him, Thou unwise one, this night they shall require thy soul of thee (Luke 12:19, 20). In Moses: When the soul of Rachel was departing, she called his name Benoni (Gen. 35:18). All the men are dead who sought thy soul (Exod. 4:19). And elsewhere: By the hand of them that seek thy soul (Jer. 19:7, 9; 34:21). He that falleth away to the Chaldeans shall live, and his soul shall be to him for a spoil (Jer. 21:9). I will give thy soul for a prey (Jer. 45:5)."

In these passages “soul” is used for the life of the body. Likewise the Lord said of the life of His body in the Gospels: As the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister and to give His soul a redemption for many (Matt. 20:28; Mark 10:45). Behold I love thee, therefore I will give a man for thee; and peoples for thy soul (Isa. 43:4). Jesus said, Greater love hath no one than this, that one lay down his soul for his friends (John 15:13). Jesus said, I am the good shepherd; the good shepherd layeth down his soul for the sheep. I lay down My soul and I will take it again; no man taketh it away from Me, but I lay it down of Myself; I have power to lay it down and I have power to take it again (John 10:11, 12, 15, 17, 18). 750d.

Let every soul praise Jah (Ps. 150:6). They will ask food for their soul (Ps. 78:18). Jehovah breathed into man’s nostrils the breath of lives, and man became a living soul (Gen. 2:7). In these passages “soul” is used for the life of man’s spirit, which is called his spiritual life. 750e. [6] (4) Since man has two faculties of life, namely, a faculty to understand and a faculty to will, and these two faculties constitute the spiritual life of man, it can be seen from certain passages cited above, as also from the following, that “soul” signifies that faculty that is called the life of man’s understanding. As in Moses: Thou shalt love Jehovah thy God with all thy heart, with all thy soul, and with all thy might (Deut. 6:5; 10:12; 11:13; 26:16). And in the Gospels: Jesus said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind (Matt. 22:37; Mark 12:30, 33; Luke 10:27). “To love Jehovah God with all the heart and all the soul” means with all the will and all the understanding, also with all the love and all the faith, for “heart” signifies the love and the will, and “soul” signifies the faith and the understanding. “Heart” signifies these two, the love and the will, because a man’s love is of his will; and “soul” signifies the two, namely, faith and understanding, because faith is of the understanding. This is the signification of “heart and soul” because the heart of man corresponds to the good of love that belongs to his will, and the soul [or breath] of the lungs corresponds to the truth of faith that belongs to man’s"

Here, too, “soul” stands for the understanding of truth, which is said “not to be satisfied” when there is no truth in the church, and “bowels” stand for the will of good, and are said “not to be filled” when there is no good in the church. Because “silver” from correspondence signifies truth, and in the contrary sense falsity, and “gold” signifies good, and in the contrary sense evil, it is said, “their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of Jehovah’s anger”; “silver and gold” meaning what is not true and what is not good, and also what is false and evil, and “day of anger” meaning the day of judgment.

Here, again, the soul signifies the man in respect to the understanding of good and truth, “the soul of the hungry” the understanding of good, and “drink for the soul of the thirsty” the understanding of truth. That a man who is in the falsities of evil will endeavor to deprive a man who is in truth from good of that truth is signified by “the fool speaketh foolishness, to make empty the soul, and to cause it to fail.” [10] In the same: It shall be as when a hungry man dreameth as if he were eating, but when he awaketh his soul is empty; and when a thirsty man dreameth as if he were drinking, but when he awaketh behold he is faint, and his soul hath appetite; so shall be the multitude of all nations that make war against Mount Zion (Isa. 29:8). This is said of those who are in falsities from evil and yet think them to be truths from good; the falsities from evil combating against the goods of the church are signified by “the multitude of all nations that make war against Mount Zion”; “multitude” is predicated of truths, “nations” signify evils, and “Mount Zion” signifies the church in respect to the good of love. Believing evils to be good when they are the evils of falsity is signified by “It shall be as when a hungry man dreameth as if he were eating, but when he awaketh his soul is empty”; “a hungry man dreaming as if he were eating” signifies an erroneous opinion and belief about good; “to dream” signifying an erroneous opinion and belief, and “to be hungry and as if he were eating” signifying as it were a desire for good that will give nourishment; “but when he awaketh” signifies when it is discovered what good is; “his soul is empty” signifies that there is no understanding of good. Like things are said of truth, which are signified by “when a thirsty man dreameth as if he were drinking, but when he awaketh behold he is faint, and his soul hath appetite”; “to be thirsty and as if drinking while he dreams” signifies an opinion and belief that it is true; “but when he awaketh behold he is faint, and his soul hath appetite,” signifies that still it is"

Such are all those who are in the falsities of doctrine, and have faith merely in masters and books, and do not consider whether what they are taught is false and evil, believing it to be true and good because it can be confirmed, not knowing that falsity and evil can be confirmed just as well as truth and good. [11] In the same: If thou shalt draw out thy soul to the hungry and satisfy the afflicted soul thy light shall arise in darkness, and thy thick darkness be as the noonday (Isa. 58:10). “To draw out the soul to the hungry and to satisfy the afflicted soul” signifies to teach one who desires it what is good and what is true; “the hungry” signifies one who desires good, and “the afflicted” one who desires truth, and “to draw out the soul” signifies to teach good and truth, that is, from the understanding, doctrine and faith. That to those who are in ignorance and yet have a desire there shall be given an understanding of truth and good, is signified by “thy light shall arise in darkness and thy thick darkness be as the noonday”; “darkness” and “thick darkness” meaning ignorance of truth and good, and “light” and “noonday” meaning the understanding of good and truth.

That there are no longer any that teach good and truth is signified by “my priests and my elders have expired in the city”; “priests” signifying those who teach good, and “elders” those who teach truths, and “city” doctrine, and “to expire” that these no longer exist.

In David: Mine eye wasteth away with vexation, and my belly (Ps. 31:9). My60 soul is bowed down to the dust, our belly cleaveth to the earth (Ps. 44:25). This also describes the state of temptations. The “eye” signifies the understanding, the “soul” the belief in truth and the understanding of truth, and the “belly” the belief in good and the understanding of good. This is the signification of “belly” because the belly receives food, and “food” and “bread” signify good that nourishes, here the understanding and faith. The lack of these in temptation is signified by “wasting away with vexation,” and “bowing down to the dust,” and “cleaving to the earth.” [15] In Moses: They said, Now is our soul dried up, there is nothing at all except this manna before our eyes (Num. 11:6). Because “manna” signifies spiritual nourishment, and it is the faith and understanding, or the intelligence of man, that is spiritually nourished, and because the sons of Israel had no natural nourishment, which yet they desired, so they said, “Our soul is dried up, there is nothing at all except this manna before our eyes”; “the soul dried up” signifies the life of faith and of the understanding failing when there was not at the same time any natural nourishment; “there is nothing at all except this manna"

In the Gospels: Be ye not anxious for your soul what ye shall eat and what ye shall drink, nor for your body what ye shall put on; is not the soul more than nourishment, and the body more than the raiment? (Matt. 6:25; Luke 12:22, 23) Although this is said of the life of the body, still it signifies such things as pertain to the life of the spirit, for all things of the sense of the letter of the Word, which is natural, contain within them an internal sense which is spiritual; in this sense “to eat,” “to drink,” and “food” signify spiritual nourishment, which is the nourishment of faith together with the nourishment of the understanding, from which comes intelligence in spiritual things; therefore it is said, “Be not ye anxious for your soul what ye shall eat and what ye shall drink; is not the soul more than nourishment?” “To eat” means to perceive good intellectually and thus spiritually; “to drink” means to perceive truth intellectually and thus spiritually; and “nourishment” means good and truth from which is nutrition. “To clothe the body” and “raiment” signify truth investing the good of love and of the will; “raiment” signifies such truth, and the “body” the good of love which is the good of the will.

(But these words are explained in Arcana Coelestia, n. 2930.) [18] In Jeremiah: Thy lovers will abhor thee, they will seek thy soul (Jer. 4:30). “Lovers” mean those who are in the love of evil; “to seek the soul” signifies to wish to destroy the belief in truth and the understanding of truth by the falsities of evil. In Ezekiel: Javan and Tubal traded with the soul of man and vessels of brass (Ezek. 27:13). This is said of Tyre, which signifies the church in respect to the knowledges of truth and good; “to trade” signifies the acquisition and communication of these; “Javan and Tubal” signify external representative worship; and “the soul of man” signifies the knowledge of truth in the natural man, and “the vessels of brass” the knowledge of good in the natural man. The knowledge of natural truth is signified also by “the souls of men” in Revelation 18:13; “the souls of men” mean properly slaves or servants, which also signify in the spiritual sense the true knowledges of the natural man that are serviceable to the spiritual."

In Jeremiah: I will plant them in this land in verity, with My whole heart and with My whole soul (Jer. 32:41). As there are two things that proceed from the Lord, Divine good and Divine truth, and as these, when received by the angels of heaven and the men of the church, constitute the heav enly life with them, so it is clear what is signified by “planting them with the whole heart and with the whole soul,” namely, in His Divine good and in His Divine truth, for the “heart” signifies the Divine good of the Divine love, and the “soul” Divine truth. [20] In the same: Jehovah hath sworn by His soul (Jer. 51:14; Amos 6:8). Jehovah is said “to swear by His soul” when He confirms by His Divine truth, for “to swear” signifies to confirm, and “the soul of Jehovah” Divine truth. In David: Jehovah proveth the righteous; the wicked and him that loveth violence His soul hateth (Ps. 11:5). Here, also, “the soul of Jehovah” signifies Divine truth, for “the violent” in the Word signifies one who offers violence to Divine truth; and because this is done by the falsities of evil this is signified by the “wicked and him that loveth violence.” [21] In Isaiah: My chosen in whom My soul is well pleased, I have given My spirit upon Him (Isa. 42:1)."

In Jeremiah: Jehovah said, Though Moses and Samuel stood before Me, My soul would not be towards this people (Jer. 15:1). “Moses and Samuel” in the representative sense signify the Word; and as the Word is Divine truth, and “people” mean here the sons of Israel, who had no Divine truth that was not falsified and adulterated, it is said, “My soul would not be towards this people.” [22] In the same: Shall not My soul take vengeance? (Jer. 5:9, 29) Here, again, “the soul of Jehovah” means Divine truth; when by this the Lord executes judgment it is said that “His soul takes vengeance.” “The Son of man who is to execute judgment” has a similar signification; “the Son of man” meaning the Lord in relation to Divine truth. In the same: Receive chastisement, O Jerusalem, lest my soul be torn away from thee, and I reduce thee to wasteness (Jer. 6:8). “Jerusalem” signifies the church in respect to doctrine; “to receive chastisement” signifies to receive discipline; “lest my soul be torn away from thee” signifies lest Divine truth depart from them; and “to reduce to wasteness” signifies lest the church be desolated in respect to all truth.

[24] (6) Since “soul,” in reference to the Lord, signifies Divine truth, so it signifies spiritual life from truth. In Moses: The soul of all flesh is the blood (Lev. 17:14). As the ultimate life of man, which is the life of his body, consists in the blood, it is said that “the soul of all flesh,” that is, the life thereof, “is its blood”; but as there is a spiritual sense in every least particular of the Word, and in that sense “blood” signifies the truth of doctrine from the Word, therefore this too is signified by “the soul of flesh.” That “blood” signifies the truth of doctrine from the Word, which is Divine truth, may be seen above (n. 328a–c, 329, 476). Because this is the signification of blood, the sons of Israel were forbidden to eat blood; therefore the blood of the burnt offerings and sacrifices was sprinkled about the altar, and by the blood sanctifications and also consecrations were effected; so likewise the covenant of the God of Israel, that is, of the Lord, with the people was entered into by blood; and furthermore, the Lord has entered into a new covenant with the church of this day. This is why the blood of the Lord is called “the blood of the covenant,” that is, of conjunction with the Lord; and it is so called because it is Divine truth proceeding from the Lord that conjoins. From this it is clear why blood is called “soul.” [25] It was because of this signification of blood that from the most ancient time it was forbidden to eat blood, as can be seen in Moses: Every creeping thing that liveth shall be for food to you, but the flesh with the soul thereof, the blood thereof, ye shall not eat (Gen. 9:3, 4)."

Because “soul,” like “blood,” signifies truth from the Word, which is Divine truth proceeding from the Lord, and because all worship of the Lord is performed by means of Divine truth, it is said, “for the soul of the flesh is in the blood, therefore I have given it upon the altar,” “to give the blood upon the altar” signifying worship from Divine truth. And as all deliverance from evils and falsities, which is expiation, is effected by Divine truth and by a life according to it, it is said, “to expiate your souls, for it is the blood itself that expiateth for the soul.” [26] In the same: Surely the blood of your souls will I require, at the hand of every wild beast will I require it, especially at the hand of man, at the hand of man his brother will I require the soul of man (Gen. 9:5). Here “blood” and also “soul” mean the spiritual life of man, which is a life according to Divine truth, as can be seen from this, that whoever extinguishes that life perishes in eternal death, for that life is not extinguished but by one who is in infernal evil and falsity. (But this may be seen explained in Arcana Coelestia.) 750h. [27] (7) That “living soul” signifies life in general can be seen from passages where beasts, birds, creeping things, and fishes, are called “living souls.” As in the following: God said, Let the waters bring forth the creeping thing, the living soul. God created great whales, and every living soul that creepeth which the waters brought forth (Gen. 1:20, 21)."

Jehovah brought unto the man every beast of the field and every bird of the heavens, to see what he would call it; and whatsoever the man called it, the living soul, that was its name (Gen. 2:19). Every living soul that swimmeth, whithersoever the rivers shall come, shall live; whence there is much fish (Ezek. 47:9) Every living soul died in the sea (Rev. 16:3). In the spiritual sense all animals signify the things belonging to the natural man, and its life; and as the life of the natural man, which is life in ultimates, signifies life in the whole complex, so they are called “living souls.” [28] From this it can now be seen what “soul” signifies in the Word, namely, the life of man both natural and spiritual, thus the life both of his body and of his spirit. This also makes evident how perverted is the idea of the soul of man that is entertained, first by the learned, and from them by the common people, namely, that it is a sort of indivisible entity, having its seat in some part of the body, either in the brain or in the heart, or elsewhere; and that when it is loosed from man by death it is without a body and without such sensory and motor parts as belong to a body, but that these will be added to it at the day of the last judgment; also that in the meantime it is a something flitting in the ether, or is abiding in a somewhere, awaiting its additional part, which is the body. Such is now the world’s idea of the soul of man; although in the Word “soul” has no such meaning, but means instead the life of man, which has no existence separate from the body, but only in the body; for the body is the external form of that life that is called the soul, giving effect to its will and pleasure in both worlds, the natural in which men live and the spiritual in which spirits and angels live. And as the Divine proceeding from the Lord constitutes the life of all, therefore that life is signified by “soul” in the celestial sense. Because the Divine proceeding, wherever it comes, forms an image of the Lord, thus it so forms angels and spirits that they may be human forms according to reception; thence it now follows that"

Verse 12. For this rejoice, ye heavens and ye that dwell in them, signifies the salvation and consequent joy of those who become spiritual by the reception of Divine truth. This is evident from the signification of “rejoicing,” as being joy on account of salvation; also from the signification of “heavens,” as being those who are spiritual (of which presently); also from the signification of “ye that dwell,” as being those who live, here spiritually. (That “to dwell” signifies to live, see above, n. 133, 479, 662.) “The heavens” signify those who are spiritual, because all who are in the heavens are spiritual; and because men who have become spiritual are likewise in the heavens, although in respect to the body they are in the world, so “ye that dwell in the heavens” means not only angels, but also men. For every man with whom the interior mind, which is called the spiritual mind, has been opened, is in the heavens, yea, sometimes he even appears among the angels in the heavens. That this is so has not been known heretofore in the world; let it be known, therefore, that man in respect to his spirit is among spirits and angels, and even in that society of them into which he is to come after death. This is because the spiritual mind of man is formed wholly to the image of heaven, even so that it is a heaven in least form; consequently that mind, although it is still in the body, must nevertheless be where its form is. But this has been more fully illustrated in the work Heaven and Hell (n. 51–58), where it is shown that every angel and also every man, in respect to his interiors, if he be spiritual is a heaven in least form, corresponding to heaven in its greatest form. For this reason, where the Word treats of the creation of heaven and earth the church internal and external is meant in general, as also in particular the internal and external man, or the spiritual and natural man. From this it can be seen that “the heavens and those that dwell in them” signify all who are there, also men who are becoming spiritual by the reception of Divine truth in doctrine and life."

This is evident from the signification of “woe,” as being lamentation (of which above, n. 531); also from the signification of “those that inhabit the earth and the sea,” as being the merely natural and sensual; for as “those that dwell in the heavens” signify the spiritual, so “those that inhabit the earth and the sea” signify the natural and sensual, for the natural and sensual mind is beneath the spiritual mind, as the earth and sea are beneath the heavens. So also in the spiritual world the heavens appear on high, and far beneath them appear lands and seas; and the spiritual dwell in the heavens, while the natural dwell upon the earths far beneath them, and the sensual in the seas. For everyone has his dwelling place on high or in the deep, as his interiors, which are called interiors of the mind, are opened or closed. For this reason “heaven and earth” in certain passages in the Word signify the church internal and external, or spiritual or natural; also in particular the spiritual and the natural man, since the church is in man, and thence the man who is spiritual is a church. Here “the earth and the sea” signify the merely natural and sensual, because the earth here means the earth into which the dragon was cast out, and unto which the devil came down, as is next said. That is where the merely natural or external man is, since the natural man without the spiritual, or the external man without the internal, is upon the land that is condemned, under which is hell. For man is born sensual and natural, that is, as if in hell, because into evils of every kind; but by regeneration he becomes spiritual, and by it he is drawn out of hell and raised up into heaven by the Lord. This is why this lamentation is over those who are merely natural and sensual. There is lamentation over them because those are meant who are in faith separated from charity, that is, who say that they have faith and yet have no life of faith; and that such become merely natural and sensual has been shown above (n. 714, 739); such also are meant by “the dragon and his angels” and by “the old serpent,” but here those are meant who permit themselves"

This is evident from the signification of “devil,” as being the hell from which come evils (of which above, n. 740); also from the signification of “coming down unto them,” as being, in reference to the devil, to be among them, to lead them astray, and to be received by them. Those unto whom the devil came down mean “those that inhabit the earth and the sea,” and these signify the merely natural and sensual who have become such because they have rejected the life of faith, which is called charity; and those who reject this from religion, and who believe and say in their heart that what they do contributes nothing to salvation, but faith alone and piety in worship are what save, such continue natural, and even become sensual so far as they reject goods in act or deeds, and give themselves up to the pleasures that spring from the loves of self and of the world. Because such continue natural and even become sensual, they receive with delight the evils that rise up out of hell; for the natural man is in those evils from birth, and unless he becomes also spiritual he continues in them; for when man becomes spiritual he has communion with the heavens, and receives goods therefrom, and goods received from the Lord through heaven remove evils, which is effected solely by means of a life according to the commandments from the Word. 754.

The devil’s hatred is against spiritual truths and goods, because merely natural truths and goods are the direct opposites of these, for merely natural truths and goods are in their essence falsities and evils, although to those who are merely natural and sensual they appear to be truths and goods; because their goods are pleasures and delights flowing from the loves of self and the world, and their truths are whatever favor those goods; consequently as the loves of self and of the world are from hell, these goods and truths are in their essence evils and falsities. But spiritual truths and goods are in their essence truths and goods, because these goods are delights flowing from love to the Lord and from love towards the neighbor, and spiritual truths are what teach these goods; and these truths and goods are called spiritual because they are from the Lord through heaven, since everything that proceeds from the Lord is called spiritual. And since these truths and goods cannot be received by man unless he believes them and does them, it is added, which are of faith and life from the Word. To live from the Word is to live from the Lord, for the Lord is in the Word, yea, He is the Word. [2] Now as merely natural truths and goods, which in their essence are falsities and evils, are altogether opposite to spiritual truths and goods, which in their essence are truths and goods, therefore the devil, by whom is meant hell, is in unceasing hatred against them. This is why hatreds of various kinds are unceasingly ascending from the hells; while on the other hand, spiritual loves also of various kinds descend from the heavens, and between the hatreds of the hells and the loves of the heavens there is an equilibrium, in which the men in the world are held, in order that they may be able to act from freedom according to reason. Consequently those who do not live from the Word but from the world, since they continue natural, receive evils and the falsities thence from hell, and conceive from them hatred against spiritual truths and goods."

Then they burn against those who are in spiritual truths and goods with a hatred so great that it cannot be described; it is indeed a deadly hatred; for as soon as they see an angel who is in these truths and goods, or if they merely hear the Lord named, from whom these truths and goods are, they instantly come into a fury of hatred, and feel nothing more delightful than to pursue them and to do evil to them. And as they are unable to slay their body they endeavor with a burning heart to slay their soul. [3] It is said, “Woe to those that inhabit the earth and the sea, for the devil is come down unto you having great anger,” because after the last judgment the state of the spiritual world was altogether changed. Before the last judgment those who were able to live a civil and moral life in externals, although they were not spiritual, were permitted to form for themselves seeming heavens, and to enjoy there pleasures like those in the world; but after the last judgment was accomplished this is no longer permitted, for now everyone according to his life is carried off, he who is merely natural to hell and he who is spiritual to heaven. This also is the meaning of the words, “the dragon and his angels were cast out of heaven into the earth,” namely, that before this it was granted them to have conjunction with the angels who were in the lowest heavens, and because of this to form for themselves such heavens; but now this is no longer permitted.

This takes place first in the spiritual world, and afterward in the natural world; for in things pertaining to heaven and the church both worlds act as one; since a man who is living in the natural world can think about spiritual things no otherwise than the spirits and angels that are with him think, because spiritual things are above man’s natural thought, and the things that are above are dependent on influx; yet this influx is received only by those who are inwardly spiritual, that is, who are in the affection of truth for the sake of truth, and who are living according to truths. By such the religion of faith separated from the life of charity is not acknowledged, but is accounted as vile.

His hatred is further described in what follows by the words, “he cast out after the woman out of his mouth water as a river, that it might swallow her up”; and at last, when he had tried all in vain, “he was wroth, and went away to make war with the remnant of her seed.” [2] Those who are meant by “the dragon” have such hatred against those who are meant by “the woman,” because those who are in faith separated from charity have such hatred against those who are in charity, and as those who are in separated faith have conjunction with the hells, their hatred is like that of the hells against the heavens. The source of this hatred shall also be briefly explained. All who are in the hells are in the loves of self and the world, but all who are in the heavens are in love to the Lord and love towards the neighbor, and these loves are direct opposites. Those who are in the loves of self and of the world love nothing but what is their own, and what is man’s own is nothing but evil; but those who are in love to the Lord and love towards the neighbor do not love what is their own, for they love the Lord above self, and the neighbor beyond self. Moreover, they are withheld from what is their own, and are held in the Lord’s own, which is the Divine. Furthermore, all the delights of life are delights of loves; the delights of the loves of self and of the world are the delights of various kinds of hatred, but the delights of love to the Lord and love towards the neighbor are the delights of various kinds of charity, and the former are the direct opposites of the latter; and as those who are in the hells act in all their activities from the delights of their loves, which, as has been said, are the delights of various kinds of hatred, it is evident why the dragon has such hatred against the woman; for “the"

He is also called “the old serpent,” which means the sensual, which is the ultimate of man’s life, and in that sensual all such hatred has its seat. Those who are in faith separated from charity have a like hatred against those who are in charity; which hatred is not manifested in this world, but in the spiritual world when they become spirits. That this is a deadly hatred, and that it is the very delight of the life of evil spirits, may be seen above (n. 754); but that such delight is turned into what is direfully infernal may be seen in the work Heaven and Hell (n. 485–490). 759.

Divine truth is the Word, and those who are of that church are enlightened by the spiritual light of the Word by influx from the Lord out of heaven, for the reason that they acknowledge the Divine in the Lord’s Human, and are in the spiritual affection of truth from Him. They and no others receive spiritual light, which is continually flowing in from the Lord through heaven with all who read the Word. From this they have enlightenment. [3] How enlightenment is effected shall also be told. Every man in respect to his thoughts and affections is in the spiritual world, consequently he is there in respect to his spirit, for it is the spirit of man that thinks and that is affected. The man who becomes spiritual by being regenerated by the Lord is in respect to his spirit in a heavenly society, while the natural man, that is, one who is not regenerated, is in respect to his spirit in an infernal society; with the latter evils flow in continually from hell, and are also received with delight; but with the former goods flow in continually from heaven, and are also received; and as goods flow into his affection, and through the affection into his thought, from that he has enlightenment.

The spiritual also are comparatively like eagles flying on high; while those who are merely natural are comparatively like serpents who creep on the ground, and see the eagles above them. For this reason the dragon is called a “serpent” in the next verse.

Because they are unable to see truths from the light of truth, and thus apprehend them in the understanding, they are in an obscure, yea, in a blind faith about what is to be believed; and a blind faith is like an eye that sees little or nothing. Yea a blind faith is not faith, but only a persuasion; and as such a persuasion is from another, either from some master or preacher, or from the Word not understood, it is a historical faith, which is natural and not spiritual. Because such persons do not see truths they also say and wish that the doctrinals of the church should not be approached or regarded with any understanding, but that they should be received with that obedience that is called the obedience of faith; and whether the things that are received with a blind obedience are true or false is not known.

Moreover, the light of heaven is such that by it truths appear before the understanding of the mind, as objects in the world appear before the sight of the eye; consequently when those in the world who have seen truths only from a blind sight of faith are conveyed into heaven to the angels, they see nothing at all, not even the angels there, much less the magnificent things they have.

It is said “a time, times, and half a time,” because “time” in the singular signifies a state of good, “times” in the plural a state of truth, both in respect to their implantation, and “half a time” signifies a holy state of the church. They have this signification because a thing in the singular involves good, in the plural truths, and a “half” holiness; a “half” involves holiness because “three,” likewise “three and a half” and “seven,” signify fullness, but “seven” signifies fullness when things holy are treated of, and the half after the three fills out or constitutes the number seven, for three and a half doubled makes seven, and a number doubled or multiplied has a similar signification as the number that is doubled or multiplied, as seven has a similar signification here as three and a half. That “seven” signifies fullness and the whole, and is predicated of things holy, may be seen above (n. 20, 24, 257). That “a time, times, and half a time,” have this signification can be seen from these words in Daniel: A man clothed in linen held up his right hand and his left hand unto the heavens, and sware by Him that liveth forever that it shall be for a fixed time of fixed times and a half; and when they shall make an end of scattering the hand of the people of holiness all these things shall be consummated (Dan. 12:7). From this it is clear that these times signify a consummation, for it is said “until all these things shall be consummated,” and consummation means fulfillment, thus even to fullness. 762.

Verse 15. And the serpent cast out after the woman out of his mouth water as a river, signifies crafty reasonings in abundance respecting justification by faith alone by those who think sensually and not spiritually. This is evident from the signification of a “serpent,” as being those who are sensual, and in an abstract sense the sensual, which is the ultimate of the natural in man (see above, n. 70, 581, 739); that “dragons” also mean those who are sensual may be seen above (n. 714); also from the signification of “the woman,” as being the church which will be the New Jerusalem (which is treated of in this chapter several times); also from the signification of “mouth,” as being thought, from which is speech (see above n. 580); also from the signification of “water,” as being the truth of faith, and in the contrary sense falsity (see above, n. 483, 518, 537, 538); also from the signification of “river,” as being intelligence from the understanding of the truth, and in the contrary sense reasoning from falsities (see also above, n. 518); consequently “casting out water as a river” signifies reasoning from falsities in abundance. Keen reasonings respecting justification by faith alone by those who think sensually and not spiritually are here meant, because “the dragon” means those who defend justification by faith alone, and who are sensual, and therefore think and reason sensually and not spiritually. (That “the dragon” signifies those who defend justification by faith alone may be seen above, n. 714.) This is meant for the reason also that “dragons” and “serpents” signify those who are sensual, and because sensual men are more crafty than the rest, and reason keenly from falsities and from fallacies.

Their dogma is that man is justified and saved by faith alone without the works of the law, which are the goods of charity. But inasmuch as they find in the Word of both testaments “works” and “deeds,” as well as “doing” and “loving,” so frequently mentioned, they can do no otherwise than affirm that one ought to live well; but since they have separated works or deeds from faith as not justifying and saving, they craftily join these and faith together, but still in such a manner that they rather separate than conjoin them. But as their reasonings are too abundant and too crafty to be set forth in a few words, therefore they shall be set forth in a small work on spiritual faith, and be so presented as to be comprehended even by the simple. It is commonly believed, and they themselves who defend justification by faith alone believe, that they think and reason spiritually because they think and reason keenly and craftily. But let it be known that only he who is in enlightenment from the Lord, and thence in the spiritual affection of truth, thinks and reasons spiritually, for these are in the light of truth, and the light of truth is the light of heaven from which the angels have intelligence and wisdom; that light is what is called spiritual light, and consequently those who are in that light are spiritual. But those who are in falsities, however keenly they may think and reason, are not spiritual, but natural, yea, sensual, for their thoughts and reasonings therefrom are for the most part from the fallacies of the senses, which some adorn with eloquence and embellish with the flowers of rhetoric, and confirm by appearances from nature alone, while others add knowledges and adapt them to their reasonings, and these they proclaim from the fire of self-love and the pride of self-intelligence therefrom that sounds like the affection of truth. In such things their craftiness consists, and to such as cannot or dare not enter with any understanding into the things that pertain to the church and the Word this seems to be wisdom.

This is the meaning of the Lord’s words in Luke: The sons of this age are for their own generation more prudent than the sons of the light (Luke 16:8); also by these words respecting the serpent in Moses: The serpent was more crafty than any wild beast of the field which Jehovah God had made (Gen. 3:1); “the serpent” signifies the sensual of man.

[2] These things must be understood as follows: it is said above that “the woman fled into the wilderness where she hath a place prepared by God,” and afterwards that she received “the wings of an eagle and flew to her place,” which signifies that the church that is called the New Jerusalem is to tarry among those who are in the doctrine of faith separate while it grows to fullness, until provision is made for it among many. But in that church there are dragons who separate faith from good works not only in doctrine but also in life; but the others in the same church who live the life of faith, which is charity, are not dragons, although they are among them, for they do not know otherwise than that it is according to doctrine that faith produces fruits, which are good works, and that the faith that justifies and saves is believing what is in the Word, and doing it. But the dragons have wholly different sentiments; but what these are the others do not comprehend, and because they do not comprehend them they do not receive them. From this it is clear that the church consisting of those who are not dragons is meant by the “earth” that “helped the woman and swallowed up the river that the dragon cast out of his mouth.” But what and how crafty and even pernicious are the reasonings of those who are meant by “the dragon” about the separation of faith from good works, and about their conjunction, will, the Lord willing, be revealed elsewhere; likewise that these reasonings are only with the learned leaders of the church, and are not known to the people of the church because they are not understood by them, therefore it is by the latter that the new church which is called the Holy Jerusalem, is helped and also grows."

This is evident from the signification of “going away,” as being an ardent effort from a life of evil (of which presently); also from the signification of “making war,” as being to assault and to wish to destroy (of which above, n. 573, 734); also from the signification of “her seed,” as being the truths of doctrine of the church (of which also presently). It is said “the remnant of her seed” because it means those who are in these truths, and in an abstract sense the truths of that church, which they believe themselves capable of assaulting and destroying. “To go away” signifies an ardent effort from a life of evil, because “to go” signifies in the spiritual sense to live, therefore in the Word the expressions “going with the Lord,” and “walking with Him” and “after Him,” are used, and these signify to live from the Lord; but when “going” is predicated of the dragon, whose life is a life of evil, it signifies to make an effort from that life; and because that effort is an effort from hatred, which is signified by “his anger” (see above, n. 754, 758), so an ardent effort is signified because he who makes an effort from hatred makes an ardent effort. [2] As the hatred of those who are meant by “the dragon” is a hatred against those who are in the truths of doctrine of the church which is the New Jerusalem, therefore it is a hatred against the truths of doctrine that such have. For those who are in love towards anyone, as also those who are in hatred against anyone, are indeed in love towards a person or in hatred against a person with whom those things are which they either love or hate, and these are the truths of doctrine with them, therefore the truths of doctrine are signified by “the remnant of her seed.” This shows that in the spiritual sense of the Word person is not regarded, but a thing abstracted from person, as here a thing that is with the person. This may be further illustrated by the saying in the Word that the neighbor must be loved as one loves himself, but in the spiritual sense this does not mean that the neighbor is thus to be loved in"

[3] From this it can be seen that “the remnant of her seed,” namely, of the woman who signifies the church, means those who are in the truths of doctrine of that church; and in a sense abstracted from persons which is the genuine spiritual sense, the truths of the doctrine of that church are meant. 768b. Likewise elsewhere in the Word, as in the following passages. In Moses: I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and the woman’s seed. He shall trample on thy head and thou shalt wound his heel (Gen. 3:15). This is a prophecy respecting the Lord. The “serpent” here signifies the sensual of man, where what is man’s own has its seat, which in itself is nothing but evil; and the “woman” signifies the spiritual church, or the church which is in Divine truths. And as the sensual of man has been destroyed, and when the man of the church becomes spiritual he is elevated out of the sensual, it is said, “there shall be enmity between thee and the woman.” “The seed of the serpent” signifies all falsity from evil, and “the seed of the woman” all truth from good, and in the highest degree Divine truth; and as all Divine truth is from the Lord, and as by it the Lord destroys falsity from evil, it is said “He shall trample on thy head, “He” meaning the Lord, and “head” all falsity from evil.

That the ultimate of truth and the sense of the letter have suffered and do still suffer hurt from the sensual, can be seen from this single example, that the papists understand the woman here to mean Mary and the worship of her; therefore in their Bibles the reading is not “He,” but “it” and “she.” So in a thousand other passages.

This is said of the Lord, and of the new church from Him. His coming is signified by “Behold the days shall come”; “to sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah” signifies to reform those who will be of that church, “the house of Israel” signifying the spiritual church, and “the house of Judah” the celestial church; and as reformation is effected by means of spiritual truths and by means of natural truths therefrom, it is said “with the seed of man and with the seed of beast”; “the seed of man” signifying spiritual truth from which man has intelligence, and “the seed of beast” signifying natural truth from which man has knowledge, also life according to it, both of these from the affection of good. That “man” signifies the affection of spiritual truth and good may be seen above (n. 280); and “beast” natural affection (n. 650); thus “the seed of man and the seed of beast” signify the truths of those affections. In Malachi: There is not one who doeth this who hath the spirit; is there one that seeketh the seed of God?

This is said of the Lord, and the whole of this chapter treats of His temptations, by means of which He subjugated the hells. The increasing grievousness of His temptations is described by “Jehovah willed to bruise Him, and to weaken Him”; the most grievous temptation, which was the passion of the cross, is signified by “if Thou shalt make His soul a guilt offering”; “to make His soul a guilt offering” signifies the last temptation, by which He fully subjugated the hells and fully glorified His Human, which is the means of redemption. The Divine truth that afterwards proceeded from His Divine Human, and the salvation of all who receive Divine truth from Him, is signified by “He shall see seed”; that this will continue forever is signified by “He shall prolong days”; “to prolong” signifying in reference to the Lord to continue forever, and “days” signifying states of light, which are states of the enlightenment of all by Divine truth; that this is from His Divine for the salvation of the human race is signified by “the will of Jehovah shall prosper by His hand.” [6] In the same: Fear not, for I am with thee; I will bring thy seed from the sunrise, and I will bring thee together from the west; I will say to the north, Give, and to the south, Hold not back; bring my sons from afar, and my daughters from the end of the earth (Isa. 43:5, 6).

From this it is evident that the Jews are not meant by “the seed of Abraham,” but that “Abraham” means the Lord, and “the seed of Abraham” Divine truth from the Lord, which is the Word; for it is said, “I know that ye are Abraham’s seed; yet ye seek to kill Me, because My word hath no place in you.” The Lord’s saying “I know that ye are Abraham’s seed” signifies that He knew that the truth of the church, which is the Word, was with them; but that they nevertheless rejected the Lord is signified"

The Lord said “I know that ye are Abraham’s seed” for the further reason that “Judah” signifies the Lord in reference to the Word (as may be seen above, n. 119, 433a). [15] In David: He will make them to fall in the wilderness, and will make their seed to fall among the nations and will scatter them in the lands (Ps. 106:26, 27). “To make their seed to fall among the nations and to scatter them in the lands” signifies that Divine truth would perish with them by evils and falsities. “The seed of Israel” has a similar signification in these passages: Thou Israel My servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, the seed of Abraham My friend, whom I have taken hold of from the ends of the earth (Isa. 41:8, 9). I will pour out My spirit upon the seed of Israel and Jacob, and My blessing upon their offspring (Isa. 44:3). In Jehovah all the seed of Israel shall be justified, and shall glory (Isa. 45:25). Jehovah who brought up and who brought back the seed of the house of Israel out of the land63 towards the north, and out of all the lands whither I have driven them, that they may dwell upon their own land (Jer. 23:8). In the highest sense “Israel” means the Lord in relation to the internal of the church, therefore “his seed” similarly signifies the Divine truth that is with those who are of the church that is signified by “Israel.” “Israel” means the church with those who are"

[16] Since “David” in the Word means the Lord in reference to royalty, and the Lord’s royalty means Divine truth in the church, so his “seed” means those who are in the truths of the church from the Word, who are called “the sons of the king” and “the sons of the kingdom”; it means also that Divine truth is with them, as in the following passages: As the host of the heavens shall not be numbered, nor the sand of the sea measured, so will I multiply the seed of David and the Levites My ministers (Jer. 33:22). I have made a covenant with My chosen, I have sworn to David My servant, Even to eternity will I establish thy seed, and will build up thy throne to generation and generation. I will set his seed forever, and his throne as the days of the heavens. His seed shall be to eternity, and his throne as the sun before Me (Ps. 89:3, 4, 29, 36). That “David” means in the Word the Lord in reference to royalty, which is Divine truth in the Lord’s spiritual kingdom, may be seen above (n. 205); therefore “his seed” signifies that Divine truth with those who are in truths from good, thus also who are in the truths of doctrine from the Word; for truths of doctrine from the Word, or the truths of the Word, are all from good; and as these are meant by “the seed of David,” so in an abstract sense the truth of the Word or the truth of the doctrine from the Word is meant by it. That “the seed of David” does not mean his posterity anyone can see, for it is said that “his seed shall be multiplied as the host of the heavens and the sand of the sea,” and that “it shall be established and set to eternity,” also that “his throne shall be built up to generation and generation,” and “shall be as the days of the heavens,” and “as the sun,” which cannot at all be said of the seed of David, that is, of his posterity and of his throne, for where now are his seed and throne to be found? But all these things harmonize when “David” is taken to mean the Lord, “his throne” heaven and the church, and “his seed” the truth of heaven and of the church."

Jehovah said, who giveth the sun for a light by day, the statutes of the moon and stars for a light by night. If these statutes shall remove from before Me, the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation before Me all the days (Jer. 31:35, 36). In these passages again, “the seed of Jacob” and of “David,” likewise “the seed of Israel,” mean those who are in Divine truths; but “the seed of Jacob” means those who are in natural Divine truth, “David” those who are in spiritual Divine truth, and “Israel” those who are in natural-spiritual Divine truth, which is mediate between natural Divine truth and spiritual Divine truth. For there are degrees of Divine truth, as there are degrees of its reception in the three heavens by the angels and in the church. “The covenant of day and night, and the statutes of heaven and earth,” signifying the conjunction of the Lord with those who are in Divine truths in the heavens, and with those who are in Divine truths on the earth, “covenant” signifying conjunction, and “statutes” the laws of conjunction, which are also the laws of order, and the laws of order are Divine truths; while “day” signifies such light of truth as the angels in the heavens have; and “night” such light of truth as men on the earth have, likewise such light of truth as those have who are in the heavens and on the earth under the Lord as a moon; therefore it is added, “who giveth the sun for a light by day, and the statutes of the moon and stars for a light by night.” But here “the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,” mean all who are of the Lord’s church, in every degree; of these and of the seed of Jacob and David it is said that if they acknowledge not the Lord, and receive not Divine truth from Him, the Lord will not reign over them.

This is said of Coniah, king of Judah, who is here called “a despised and worthless idol,” and it is said of him: That he and his seed shall be taken away and cast unto the earth (verse 28). This king has a similar signification as satan, and “his seed” signifies infernal falsity; that this shall not rule in the Lord’s church, in which is celestial Divine truth, is signified by “no one of his seed shall sit upon the throne of David or shall rule anymore in Judah,” “Judah” here meaning the celestial church in which the Lord reigns. [19] As “David” represented the Lord’s royalty, so “Aaron” represented his priesthood; therefore “the seed of Aaron” means those who are in the affection of genuine truth which is from celestial good. Because of this representation this statute was given for Aaron: The high priest shall not take a widow, or one divorced, or one polluted, a harlot, but he shall take a virgin of his own people to wife, lest he profane his seed among his people; I Jehovah do sanctify him (Lev. 21:14, 15). As “man and wife” in the Word in its spiritual sense signify the understanding of truth and the will of good, and as thought is of the understanding and affection is of the will, so “man and wife” also signify the thought of truth and the affection of good, likewise truth and good. Thence it is clear what is signified by a “widow,” by “one divorced,” and by “one polluted” and “a harlot”; “a widow” signifies good without truth, because left by truth, which is the man; “one divorced” signifies good rejected by truth, thus discordant good; and “one polluted, a harlot,” signifies good adulterated by falsities, which is no longer good but evil. Because of this signification of these women the high priest was forbidden to take any of them to wife, because he represented the"

And as a “virgin” signifies the will or affection of genuine truth, and genuine truth makes one with and is in harmony with Divine good, and these two are conjoined in heaven and in the church, and their conjunction is called the heavenly marriage, therefore it was required that the high priest should take a virgin to wife. And as the truth of doctrine is born of this marriage, while the falsity of doctrine is born of a marriage with such as are signified by “a widow,” “one divorced,” and “one polluted, a harlot,” it is said, “lest he profane his seed among his peoples,” “seed” signifying the genuine truth of doctrine, and thus also the doctrine of genuine truth from the good of celestial love, and “his peoples” signifying those who are of the church in which there is the doctrine of genuine truth from the Word. Also as this was a representative of the heavenly marriage, which is the marriage of the Lord with the church, therefore it is said, “I Jehovah do sanctify him.” [20] Since the high priest represented the Lord in reference to Divine good, and his “seed” signified Divine truth, which is the same as the genuine truth of doctrine, it was also made a statute: That no man a stranger, who was not of the seed of Aaron, shall come near to burn incense before Jehovah (Num. 16:40). “A man a stranger” signifies the falsity of doctrine, and “burning incense” signifies worship from spiritual good, which in its essence is genuine truth; and “the seed of the high priest” signifies Divine truth from a celestial origin; therefore it was decreed by law that no stranger who was not of the seed of Aaron should burn incense in the tent of meeting before Jehovah. [21] When it is known what of heaven and the church was represented also by other persons mentioned in the Word, what is signified by “their seed” will also be known, as by the seed of Noah, Ephraim, and Caleb, in the following passages. Of Noah: I establish My covenant with you and with your seed after you (Gen. 9:9)."

What “Noah” and “Ephraim” represented and signified has been explained in Arcana Coelestia. But “Caleb” represented those who are to be introduced into the church; therefore their “seed” signifies the truth of the doctrine of the church. [22] The “seed of the field” has a similar signification as the “seed of man,” because a “field,” the same as “man,” signifies the church; for this reason the terms “seed” and also “sowing” are in some passages applied to the people of the earth the same as they are applied to a field, as in the following. In Jeremiah: I had planted thee a noble vine, a seed of truth; how art thou turned into branches of a strange vine unto Me! (Jer. 2:21). In David: Their fruit will I65 destroy from the earth, and their seed from the sons of man (Ps. 21:10). In Hosea: I will sow Israel unto Me in the earth (Hos. 2:23).

But it is not necessary to show here that the seed of the field has a similar meaning as the seed of man, for here only what is signified by “the seed of the woman” is what is to be explained and confirmed from the Word. 768e. [23] Since “seed” signifies the truth of doctrine from the Word, and in the highest sense Divine truth, so in the contrary sense “seed” signifies the falsity of doctrine and infernal falsity. As in Isaiah: Draw near hither, ye sons of the sorceress, ye seed of the adulterer, and thou that hast66 committed whoredom. Against whom do ye sport yourselves, against whom do ye make wide the mouth and lengthen the tongue? Are ye not children of transgression, the seed of a lie?

The Word is said to be falsified when its truths are perverted, and to be adulterated when its goods are perverted, as also when truths are applied to the loves of self. “Children of transgression and seed of a lie” signify falsities flowing from such prior falsities. “To sport themselves” signifies to take delight in things falsified; “to make wide the mouth” signifies delight in the thought therefrom; and “to lengthen the tongue” delight in teaching and propagating such falsities.

The falsity of those who are in evils is signified by “a seed of evildoers,” and the falsities of those who are in the falsities from that evil are signified by “sons that are corrupters.” (That “sons” signify those who are in truths, and in the contrary sense those who are in falsities, and in an abstract sense truths and falsities, may be seen above, n. 724.) “They have forsaken Jehovah and have provoked the Holy One of Israel” signifies that they have rejected Divine good and Divine truth; “Jehovah” meaning the Lord in relation to Divine good, and “the Holy One of Israel,” the Lord in relation to Divine truth; “their estranging themselves backwards” signifies that they wholly departed from good and truth, and went away to infernal evil and falsity, for those in the spiritual world who are in evils and falsities turn themselves backward from the Lord (see in the work Heaven and Hell, n. 123).

That such falsity is destructive of every good of the Word and of the church is signified by “I will set My faces against that man, and I will cut him off from the midst of his people, because he hath defiled My sanctuary and profaned the name of My holiness,” “sanctuary” signifying the truth of heaven and the church, and “the name of holiness” all that it is.

This is evident from the signification of “keeping the commandments of God,” as being to live according to the commandments in the Word; and as that life is a life of faith, and a life of faith is charity, therefore “keeping the commandments of God” signifies to live the life of faith, which is charity. The life of faith is charity towards the neighbor, because faith means faith in the Word, thus faith in the truth that is in the Word and from the Word, and charity means the love of good and truth, spiritual, moral, and civil; and as that which man loves he also wills, and what he wills he does, therefore “keeping the"

[2] From this it can be seen that all those who separate faith from charity know not what faith is or what charity is, for they have no other idea of faith than as being everything of the memory that is believed because they have heard it from learned men; and yet such faith is historical faith, for they do not see whether a thing is so, except because someone else has said it; and what is seen from another can be confirmed both by the sense of the letter of the Word misunderstood and by reasonings from appearances and knowledges [scientifica], although it may be a falsity directly opposed to the truth. When this is confirmed it becomes a persuasive faith; but neither this faith nor historical faith is a spiritual faith, thus not a saving faith, for such faith has as yet no life from the Lord in it. That a man may receive that life he must live according to the Lord’s commandments in the Word, for living according to these commandments is the same as living from the Lord, because the Lord is the Word and is in the Word. Such a life is the life of faith, which is charity; and then its affection becomes charity, and thought from that affection becomes faith; for all man’s thought derives its life wholly from affection, since no one can think without affection; therefore when a man’s affection becomes spiritual his thought also becomes spiritual; consequently such as a man’s charity is such is his faith. From this it can be seen that charity and faith, like affection and thought, or what is the same, like will and understanding, act as one, for affection is of the will and thought is of the understanding, consequently they act as one as goods and truths do. Thence it is clear that to live according to the commandments of the Lord from the Word, or “to keep the commandments of God,” means to live the life of faith, which is charity. 770.

And as by means of these beasts the state of those who are dragons is further described, therefore this is what is signified by “standing upon the sand of the sea.” Moreover, “the sand of the sea” signifies sterility, such as is with those who think indeed about faith, but not at all about the life of faith, which is charity, for where such dwell in the spiritual world nothing is seen but heaps of stones and also sand, and rarely any grass or shrub; this, too, is why “the sand of the sea” signifies the state of those who are meant by “the dragon.”"
